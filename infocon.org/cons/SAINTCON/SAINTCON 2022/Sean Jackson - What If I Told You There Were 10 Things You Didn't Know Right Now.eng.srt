1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
hello St Khan

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,200
who is tired

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,340
I could take a nap

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,179
yeah

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,800
okay

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,660
so

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,060
in case you're in the wrong place this

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,900
talk is about 10 things or like 23

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,400
things that you might not know

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,519
um

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,200
and uh if this is not what you're

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,180
expecting you're welcome to leave if it

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,399
is then just sit back and close your

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,360
eyes

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,780
I'll try to talk slowly and deeply

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,180
and see if I can sedate you down into a

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,160
nice

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,680
dreamless sleep

platforms I'm tarkus it's my handle

29

support minorities in Tech I love lgbtq

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,659
people I feel around this community

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,360
specifically Utah County and Utah they

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,340
don't get a lot of love so I try to give

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,560
them love

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
and all my hugs are free but you have to

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,299
ask for them I do not just give hugs out

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,159
you have to ask me for a hug and I'll

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
give you a hug

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,020
foreign

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,700
so what are we going to talk about today

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,439
this is the this is the list of things

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,060
we're going to talk about

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,340
uh we'll get there

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,579
who's this talk for if you do not have a

49
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,820
SIM

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,899
this is this is the stuff you need to

51
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,220
start watching

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,640
and this is how you build a Sim

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,620
uh you may have heard of organizations

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,080
where you've heard someone oh back back

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,959
in the day they programmed our Sim well

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,819
what we're going to talk about today is

57
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,840
the steps to build a Sim

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,860
um

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,080
if you have a SIM

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,819
this is going to be a list of things you

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,260
want to make sure your sim is alerting

62
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,300
on and this is where you get started in

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,739
threat hunting

64
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,340
I got to tell you last year uh lee uh

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,099
grifter gave a talk on threat hunting

66
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,920
and I swear it was a Sans course inside

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,540
of one hour

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,480
go look on the on YouTubes and find

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,459
grifter's talk on threat hunting from

70
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,260
last year and you will not get more

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,420
content better

72
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,519
better disseminated than than what

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,459
grifter did he is brilliant

74
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,260
but essentially

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,420
if you need to see all the things and

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
they are all over the place this is the

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,440
talk

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
what do I need to see all the things you

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
need a log aggregate server

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,560
this is a server that's going to be able

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,680
to catch all the logs from everywhere

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,040
you want a lot of storage because logs

83
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,319
take up space those are text files they

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,360
pick up a lot of space you don't need a

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,459
lot of Ram or CPU because you're not

86
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,140
doing huge computations you're just

87
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,000
collecting stuff and then you're

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,440
processing it or you're reading through

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,819
it

90
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,239
now graduate level bonus points if you

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
can have an automated system that will

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
copy all the logs from that server to

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,379
another server let's say for six months

94
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,959
your customers will want to know what's

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,480
happening with your log backups so

96
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,599
automate your log backups

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,220
so everything we're going to talk about

98
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,799
is going to forward all its logs to This

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
Server

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,379
So This Server is going to be just a a

101
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,400
behemoth of text files of logs of all

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
different kinds

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
so you need to get your data ninja

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,820
skills up

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,380
what am I talking about data ninja

106
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,639
skills

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,380
cat Cut Ock said and grep

108
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,100
uh you need to get really good at these

109
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,340
because your log files are going to be

110
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,280
big long strings that have lots of

111
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,100
different kinds of data time stamps IP

112
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,080
addresses ports

113
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,300
executions

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,460
programs

115
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,060
all kinds of data and to get value out

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,740
of that you have to be able to say out

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,020
of all of this kind of log

118
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,400
show me all of this section or show me

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,500
anything that doesn't fit in these

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,199
parameters from those logs over this

121
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,060
time period

122
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,800
so you're going to be gripping and

123
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
cutting and uh

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
a lot less a lot of cat

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,199
these are your your data ninja skills

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,860
you're going to use regex to fine-tune

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,220
stuff and regex is it's a very like a

128
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,199
friend who mumbles you don't want to

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,280
hang out with him but he's still a

130
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,139
friend

131
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,600
uh you want python that's what I

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
recommend for scripting uh

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,340
log

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,660
parsing

135
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,180
a python is a very low entrance bar into

136
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,400
scripting you want to automate this you

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,900
want things to just work on their own

138
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,960
and you want to establish as soon as you

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,940
can and this is a Perpetual thing you're

140
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,680
doing you're establishing what your

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,340
baselines are what is normal and any

142
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,259
tool you have out there that is a

143
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,340
next-gen firewall or a user Behavior

144
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,580
Analytics tool or even crowdstrike when

145
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,620
you install crowdstrike on a new host it

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,979
will run that host through some some

147
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,680
work it puts it under strain puts under

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
stress and it wants to see what the

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,060
Baseline is if it's behaving at a high

150
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,759
usage what does it do

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,580
if it is running

152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,280
30 programs within half a second what

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,360
does it do

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,400
it's getting a baseline so that if

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
something happens that's outside that

156
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,039
Baseline it knows what is wrong so when

157
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,360
you're collecting

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,160
oodles and oodles of logs you need to

159
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,919
establish what the baselines are what is

160
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,039
normal for your environment

161
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
the only way to do that is to have huge

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,180
sample sets so you start collecting the

163
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,380
logs and then you start looking at it

164
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,180
and say what's the high what's the low

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,620
what's the mean what's the average

166
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
first things probably the most important

167
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,620
things you want to be

168
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,360
watching closely

169
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,880
identity and access events

170
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,220
access levels and identities of those

171
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,860
who are logging into things

172
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,819
servers firewalls workstations who is

173
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,680
logging in

174
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,780
that's the first step if you want to see

175
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,479
if someone is doing something wrong

176
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,940
if it's an employee who is logging in

177
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,060
from

178
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,240
Sandy Utah and Pakistan

179
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,319
that's not normal

180
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,520
you want to know how frequently they log

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,300
in

182
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,660
how often does the admin log in between

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,120
the hours of 8 and 10 in the morning log

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
out between four and six and then log in

185
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,639
again at between 8 and 10 at night and

186
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,460
log out between 11 and 12.

187
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm just throwing out numbers but if if

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
your admin logs in all the time

189
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,580
on those periods you want to know when

190
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,659
he logs in at three in the morning

191
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,539
location of logins if your systems admin

192
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,720
is always logging in from Sandy like I

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,759
said and then suddenly she logs in from

194
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,800
Pakistan

195
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,680
send her a slack and say hey are you in

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,000
Pakistan

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,660
and she says no and you say well

198
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,000
it looks like you are let's let's look

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,460
at your passwords

200
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,379
and then odd times the logins like I

201
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,539
said if if you're if someone's logging

202
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,279
in all the time

203
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,979
between 8 and 10 and four and five and

204
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,958
it's that's it and then they do three in

205
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
the morning

206
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,020
if they do three in the morning two days

207
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,159
in a row something is wrong

208
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
and then

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
everything I've said so far you want to

210
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
know this for all your employees

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,019
you want to know everyone because

212
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,540
everyone is a point of of failure

213
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,860
potentially

214
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,140
but your admins if they have the keys to

215
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,120
the kingdom you really want to pay a lot

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,260
of attention to them

217
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,420
so everything about the frequency logins

218
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,640
location of logins and odd times of

219
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,160
logins pay extra close attention to that

220
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,680
for all your admins if they have

221
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,740
administrative access to anything

222
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,720
watch them closely if that feels like a

223
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,339
whole lot make sure you have as few

224
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,240
admins as possible

225
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,040
don't have a lot of admins no one should

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,100
have a lot of admin access

227
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,380
so how could you find the baselines for

228
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,680
these

229
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,459
I kind of been saying it go ahead

230
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,060
a lot of log set AC and Cat yes

231
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,100
huge data sets and then find the

232
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,240
averages

233
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
endpoint alerts so this is going to be

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
your edrs and your Epps and your xdrs

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,240
they generate logs when you have uh you

236
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,760
have crowdstrike Sitting on a

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,100
an endpoint yes there's a dashboard for

238
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,420
crowdstrike but we're talking about

239
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,279
aggregating everything together to make

240
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,580
a Sim you can forward all those endpoint

241
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,120
alerts to your aggregate server

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
you'll have to spend time looking what

243
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,899
the log looks like and how to parse data

244
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,399
out of it

245
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,760
and then uh if you're talking about sore

246
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,980
uh one of the things that I look for in

247
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,260
soar is the ability when crowdstrike

248
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,380
says I found something I say show me all

249
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,440
the IPS that machine has seen

250
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,180
so you'd have to be able to figure out

251
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,640
this machine what IPS has it gone to

252
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,920
we'll talk about netstat later on

253
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
um and what are the who is is for those

254
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,839
IP addresses

255
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,060
and what IP addresses have reached to it

256
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,680
and what are the who is is for those

257
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,700
now like I said you have dashboards for

258
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,320
these tools but you want to collect

259
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,820
everything in one place so you're not

260
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,220
hunting and packing all over the place

261
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,140
and you also might be able to get the

262
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,300
the tool to ping you

263
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,660
so I know crowdstrike can send it can

264
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,920
work with things that will send text

265
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
messages or slack messages and so these

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,300
tools can ping you and say hey I saw

267
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,800
something then you go back and check

268
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,019
your logs

269
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,600
you want to look at abnormal Ingress and

270
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,120
egress ports

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,600
so what are some of normal ports

272
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
and I'll give you some there's SSH port

273
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,740
22. nmap 445 html80 SSL 443 smtp25 DNS

274
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,540
53

275
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,519
have you heard of anyone exfiltrating

276
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,579
data over DNS

277
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,380
a couple hands

278
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,920
that's hard to find it's hard to to pick

279
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,079
up on which is why they do it

280
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,079
um

281
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,240
the way the way I've seen it they will

282
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
append little bits of data and reach out

283
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,880
for an IP address and do that over and

284
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,399
over and keep just truncating their data

285
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
onto these requests and if you control

286
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
the DNS server you can then take all

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,980
those logs put together and you have the

288
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,079
the data

289
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,920
um

290
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,260
but if something is talking

291
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,260
on if if it looks like you have DNS

292
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,600
going over

293
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,339
80 80. that's not normal

294
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,579
so where can you get this information

295
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,820
where can you find out what ports are

296
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,839
being talked over

297
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,399
anyone

298
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,980
that's that

299
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,160
get your net stat logs from a host and

300
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,100
you can see what is talking to it and

301
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,320
what it is talking to

302
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,680
this is what netstat looks like

303
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,279
it's not super pretty it's not super

304
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,160
forthcoming but in the middle let's see

305
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,680
in the middle we have some addresses I

306
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,440
have 24 143 204 224 Port 80 and 192 168

307
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,339
1 106 on Port 2848 that's right there in

308
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,360
the middle

309
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,680
you can see the 192 108.1106 the first

310
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,420
line

311
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,220
in the center

312
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,620
after the colon is the port

313
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,459
so that's how you can find the port

314
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,019
deliminator colon

315
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,380
port

316
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,240
so how could you search for uncommon

317
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,660
ports

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
how can you find the exceptions to the

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,180
normal

320
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,880
you would do a cat Cut deliminator colon

321
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,180
write to a file for each in for each

322
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,940
line in that file

323
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,480
if it's not in first thousand ports you

324
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,940
can search for common ports if it's not

325
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,519
in this then write it to another file go

326
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,620
back and find the outliers search for

327
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,019
those see what the connection was that

328
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,579
makes sense

329
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,500
this is something you want to script if

330
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,139
you see anything so you want to run all

331
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,660
your net stat logs if there's anything's

332
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
not in the first thousand common ports

333
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,820
make that a new file now go back and

334
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,160
search for those entries find the IP

335
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,300
addresses that were going to those

336
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,040
different ports and start searching

337
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,360
could you do an IP lookup to find where

338
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,959
the connection is

339
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,680
could you search for who is to find

340
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,260
information if there is any

341
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,000
and could you automate that whole

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,040
process with a script

343
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,540
does anyone think they could automate

344
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,199
that with a script

345
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,160
you can

346
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,620
you can automate that whole process of

347
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,079
look through all the Nets that logs for

348
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,240
the last 24 hours

349
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,399
running against the common ports show me

350
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,860
the outliers go back identify the rows

351
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,199
that have those outliers and run a who

352
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,839
is on all those i p addresses show me

353
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,220
what you find

354
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,740
you could do that

355
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,320
you want to know about abnormal log

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,399
volume

357
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,380
again you need a baseline of what that

358
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,160
is

359
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,920
you want to say normal is this type of

360
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,160
log and this number of logs in this time

361
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,880
identify the peak identify the low and

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,260
identify the mean the average

363
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,420
speaking of mean what might it mean if

364
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,139
there's a spike

365
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,120
if you have

366
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,639
let's say your net stat logs

367
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,519
what happens if you suddenly one machine

368
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,560
is generating five times the net stat

369
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,859
traffic

370
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,620
you might want to know that because it's

371
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,380
different for some reason the machine is

372
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,300
now doing five times more traffic than

373
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,220
it ever has before

374
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,320
five times the connections what's that

375
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,120
about what could be going on on that

376
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,360
machine

377
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,279
what does it mean if there's a flat line

378
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,860
what if a log stops

379
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,480
or whatever log

380
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,300
doesn't produce it normally produces

381
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,420
2000 logs in an hour and now it produces

382
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,719
five

383
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,339
you might have a server down you might

384
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,380
have something not working that should

385
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
be working

386
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,779
file Integrity monitoring

387
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,720
how do file Integrity tools work does

388
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,199
anyone know

389
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
how how do tools know if a file has been

390
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,139
changed

391
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,519
so it's a metadata hashes they hash them

392
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,040
you know what a hash is or anyone not

393
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,880
know what a hash is

394
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,660
okay so it's a mathematical equation

395
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,000
where you can uh

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
input a file into this equation and it

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,399
will come out with a string

398
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,740
and if you don't change it it will

399
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,120
always come out with that very same

400
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,299
string you add a space or a period and

401
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,400
the string will change

402
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,740
so if you're going to lock down you say

403
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,919
these are our these are the corporate

404
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
secret data this is customer data this

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
these things should never change

406
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
so you want to do some file Integrity

407
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,160
monitoring you could script that

408
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,919
I'm repeating myself I hate that

409
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,900
um so you want to identify what and

410
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,100
where the files are you want to make

411
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,720
sure it never changed

412
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,120
and you can script that you could say

413
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,960
go to this folder run md5 against

414
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,179
everything in here

415
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,860
go do it again

416
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,020
did anything change

417
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
do it again next week did anything

418
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,320
change

419
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,260
do it every day and if anything changes

420
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,780
then let me know

421
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,940
if it doesn't change

422
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,280
business as usual

423
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
but you can't know if it's business as

424
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,700
usual until you have your file Integrity

425
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,520
script watching everything it needs to

426
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,299
watch

427
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,059
once you know it's watching

428
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,260
let it run

429
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,059
and if if someone comes and sends you an

430
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,000
email hey something changed

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
get into it

432
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,299
vulnerability scan findings now there's

433
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,900
no rocket surgery here this is a

434
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,880
your vulnerability scanners

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,400
I use tenable they don't pay me but it's

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,340
my favorite although I feel like it's

437
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,460
getting behind the times nowadays

438
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,120
um

439
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,280
but you can have your reports that send

440
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,620
out XML

441
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,539
and then you just parse through the XML

442
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,240
you won't have alerts on criticals highs

443
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,220
and mediums and lows disregard

444
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,840
informational

445
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,620
you want to know VPN logins more access

446
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,059
and identity

447
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,539
again who is logging in

448
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,240
when are they logging in

449
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,960
where are they logging in from

450
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,460
do they get the password right the first

451
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,539
time

452
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,539
did they get it right the 300th time

453
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,380
you don't want someone using VPN and

454
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,260
trying the password 300 times and never

455
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,840
contacting it

456
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,640
that's not a good employee that's

457
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,020
someone who is an imposter

458
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,780
hahaha

459
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,720
physical access notifications

460
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
now this is an iffy this is something

461
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,400
you might not have you might not have

462
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
access to but your doors

463
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,700
uh your your scanners

464
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,640
you want to know did a deactivated card

465
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,980
try to get in

466
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,419
you don't need to know when everyone

467
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,580
logs in and when they don't or when they

468
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,280
badge in unless you have a system like

469
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
snow was talking about in the keynote a

470
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,620
badge where you have to uh badge out

471
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,299
before you leave

472
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,100
I worked at one organization that had

473
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,919
this you couldn't leave like the doors

474
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,720
wouldn't open if it wasn't an emergency

475
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
without badging out

476
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,940
kind of cool it was an insurance company

477
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,280
and they were old and they had good

478
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,539
security

479
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,799
um you want to know if a door is propped

480
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,059
open

481
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,419
if someone is moving something in if

482
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,000
they're loading up the break room great

483
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
when does that happen

484
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,200
so you could say if this door is propped

485
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,280
open at this time by this badge so the

486
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,720
bet this badge is used the door is

487
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,360
propped open it's open for half an hour

488
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,720
you know it's the the main or the office

489
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,760
crew stalking the mail room they're

490
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,500
coming back from Costco

491
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
if that's not the case if it's another

492
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,679
badge let me know

493
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,179
and then you go talk to your your

494
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,340
operations team and say no one can open

495
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,020
this no one prop this door open except

496
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,480
this badge this one badge I won't alert

497
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
on this badge you you use our badge and

498
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,020
I'm going to come talk to you

499
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,360
and then if you can

500
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,780
has an entering card not exited yet if I

501
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,340
were to do this in my organization I'd

502
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,140
have to pay to have badge readers put on

503
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,419
the inside of doors and that's something

504
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,220
that we're not going to do right now so

505
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,559
I don't have that possibility

506
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,200
if I ever do I will say you need to

507
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,940
badge in and badge out and then you can

508
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,320
get a day report at the end of the day

509
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
who didn't badge out

510
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,539
if there's someone who consistently does

511
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,299
that have a talk with them if someone

512
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,919
just does that once in a while go see if

513
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,179
they've fallen asleep under their desk

514
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,659
and for the socially comfortable

515
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,419
do the cards scanned match the people in

516
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,280
the office

517
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,460
did someone badge in and they're not in

518
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,740
the office

519
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,840
and there's a visitor in the break room

520
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
that you don't know

521
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,700
you'd want to know if that person has

522
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,380
the wrong badge or has an employee's

523
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,740
badge

524
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,299
now of all these things which of these

525
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,799
could use script checks for

526
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,200
if you have this data is there anything

527
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,480
you could not script a check for

528
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
all the stuff we're talking about going

529
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
to this aggregate server you could

530
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,220
script all of it

531
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,740
you can script all of it to find the

532
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,320
outliers and that's your sim

533
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,220
or think about Rita

534
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,260
this is real intelligence threat

535
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,380
analytics has anyone have heard of Rita

536
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,960
this is one of my favorite tools for

537
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,419
open source stuff this is so powerful

538
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,299
this was built by John Strand and black

539
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,220
hills information security

540
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,900
he named her for his mother

541
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,320
Rita strand she died in 2016.

542
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,340
this identifies C2 traffic now Rita

543
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,820
you're going to have to get a uh a feed

544
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,159
off of your switch or your firewall or

545
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
whatever to grab all the data

546
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,820
all the Nets that data

547
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,799
all the traffic

548
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,260
and it's going to make Yara logs

549
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,340
and then it is brilliant at finding the

550
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,820
C2 traffic C2 traffic is when a host is

551
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,740
compromised it's going to Ping the

552
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,880
Mothership

553
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,140
do you have instructions for me

554
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,220
do you have instructions for me

555
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,059
do you have instructions for me they'll

556
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,059
do a 35 kilobyte ping

557
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,480
let's say every three hours

558
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,400
so it never

559
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,440
trips anything it's just a quiet little

560
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,760
Pip

561
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,400
regularly scheduled Rita is really good

562
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,520
at seeing is there a commonality between

563
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,799
these little pings machines are doing

564
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,780
all kinds of traffic

565
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,299
but there are patterns and Rita finds

566
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,520
the patterns so Rita will find if

567
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,080
there's a machine that could be talking

568
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
to a command and control server

569
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,020
it's brilliant it's it's awesome and

570
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,200
this is open source it's free

571
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,900
get it

572
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,340
so

573
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,020
I should not have said this was a

574
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,000
one-hour talk we're coming about a half

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,860
hour

576
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,520
um

577
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,679
there's somewhere between 13 and 24

578
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,659
things depending on how you cut them up

579
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,820
and if you look at everything is doubled

580
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,000
for admins and regular users

581
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
your mileage may vary you may not have

582
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,140
as many of the logs as I'm talking about

583
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,539
you might have more you might have more

584
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,400
tools that can give you more insight

585
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,220
into functions of behaviors and and give

586
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,340
more things to analyze

587
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,860
and what are we really doing here we're

588
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,520
building a poor manual clunky version of

589
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,799
a Sim

590
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,039
you are aggregating all the things that

591
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,620
the computers know that you don't into

592
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
one place and you're using scripting to

593
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,380
parse out intelligent data out of those

594
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,299
logs

595
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,700
if you have a SIM

596
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,760
these are the things you want that Sim

597
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,620
paying attention to

598
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,760
tune your rules to these events

599
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,039
if you're threat hunting this is where

600
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,460
you'll find the the footprints in the

601
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,799
paint of the attackers you know I'm

602
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,659
talking about

603
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,220
back in the day when the power would go

604
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,260
out in the 7-Eleven they would throw a

605
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,179
can of paint on the floor

606
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,220
because they couldn't like lock the door

607
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,020
and they couldn't leave but if they were

608
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,580
somewhere else someone could run in grab

609
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,539
something they could see their

610
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,760
footprints in the paint

611
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,000
the logs are the footprints in the paint

612
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,580
uh something I didn't say I should have

613
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,980
you want to make sure that the logs uh

614
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,260
when they're being written to are not

615
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,940
editable

616
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,799
you want to make sure that no one can

617
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,320
write to it no human can write to it

618
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
only the various systems they're talking

619
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
to the aggregate server can can write to

620
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,740
it no one else can

621
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,860
so you there's no you there's

622
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,059
non-repudiation you can't you can't say

623
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,620
that someone modified it someone changed

624
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,120
it

625
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,239
um

626
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,520
and so if you do tune your your sim to

627
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,779
look at these things you're doing you're

628
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,340
getting a pretty good job at threat

629
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,159
hunting you're getting started again go

630
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,100
watch grifter's talk last year I think

631
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,840
from this Ballroom

632
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,059
he was brilliant it was like a Sans

633
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,220
course

634
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,919
so the next steps once you have all this

635
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,700
and this could be a year-long process to

636
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,440
build this system

637
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,299
once you do now you need to have some

638
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,460
pretty reporting so you can show people

639
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,620
the data that you're learning

640
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
and if you have actual information or if

641
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,700
you have

642
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,880
events you want to say here's the events

643
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,700
we found our homemade Sim found these

644
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,440
events and we did this and this and this

645
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,380
and this or our homemade Sim found we

646
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,539
have an incident and we did this and

647
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,799
this and this and this and you want to

648
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,700
have

649
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,799
Executives like to have pretty graphs

650
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,840
they like to have pie charts they like

651
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,039
to have

652
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,440
pretty slides and grep and awk don't

653
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,380
make pretty slides so talk to your

654
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,700
marketing department

655
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,799
figure out how you can take that data

656
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,539
make it in pretty reporting for your

657
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,799
your boards for

658
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,940
at the end

659
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,039
so hit me with your questions

660
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,779
and I'll repeat them for the video go

661
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,840
ahead

662
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,640
people need a card to get out

663
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,299
yeah train them you say this how we're

664
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,419
going to do it you uh you can get your

665
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,460
phone make a little video say I'm going

666
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,659
to badge in

667
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,059
and now on the system I know that I'm in

668
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,520
the building and if I just leave

669
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,159
I didn't do I didn't do that and I could

670
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,840
log back in or you could say your system

671
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,279
won't let you log it won't let you

672
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,360
imagine again

673
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,379
you have to badge out

674
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,340
to to bug the security guy

675
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,679
I'd say you got to bring a Tootsie Pop

676
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,080
and then I'll I'll reset your your badge

677
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,020
oh you need to have how do you interface

678
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,299
with people who have safety concerns in

679
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,640
an emergency situation uh all your doors

680
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,080
have to fail open

681
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,919
and you have to I mean if if someone if

682
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,299
everyone's in the building and they'll

683
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,059
run out and they haven't badged out

684
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,440
someone's going to call you and say hey

685
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,539
reset the badges there was a fire he

686
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,220
said oh yeah okay everyone's reset

687
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,360
right

688
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,039
I don't have a system that's tied into

689
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,960
the fire alarm

690
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,640
but yeah but

691
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
yeah something like that

692
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,840
another question

693
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,020
I see your finger

694
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,380
go ahead

695
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,340
but

696
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,320
a lot of paperwork

697
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,760
so everyone at home can hear uh what

698
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,860
happened he's saying check with your

699
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,899
local fire marshal uh check your

700
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,059
jurisdiction that you're in uh There are

701
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,299
rules and and requirements around

702
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,000
controlled egress emergency egress uh he

703
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,260
worked also for an insurance company

704
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,059
they had controlled egress and it was

705
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,880
great and perfect but there was a ton of

706
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,380
paperwork and there are rules to uh how

707
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,360
you let people out because you have to

708
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,779
let them out

709
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,620
um

710
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,239
any other questions or comments

711
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,580
it just all makes perfect sense

712
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,659
everyone's ready to go home and start

713
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,080
this project

714
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,159
there is a lot how you want to manage

715
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,679
the data I will not prescribe you can

716
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,059
figure that out if you put it in a

717
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,260
database

718
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,940
but at the the basest most simple

719
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,100
you're aggregating everything and you're

720
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,020
running scripts that we're doing cuts

721
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,720
and grips and

722
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,899
cats and writing to new files

723
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:04,200
it is that it's it's hacked

724
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,059
you hack your you hack your way into a

725
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,299
Sim uh there are more elegant ways to do

726
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,940
it databases

727
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,500
looker

728
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,039
I do

729
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,880
yeah this this well it's not too slow

730
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,679
they're text files

731
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,659
you can you can Munch through text files

732
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,640
really quickly

733
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,200
um

734
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,940
but when you have bigger and bigger

735
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,320
impacts bigger and bigger and bigger

736
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,360
text files if you're saying show me

737
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,460
everything over six months that might

738
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,960
take some time where it could be faster

739
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,679
through a database

740
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,919
so yeah that would be uh maybe a

741
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,179
graduate level you figure out how to

742
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,380
pull everything into a database

743
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,059
automatically

744
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,460
and show me database reports and you can

745
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,899
have better graphs from databases

746
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,080
any questions

747
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,120
then thank you enjoy your free

748
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,539
30 or 27 minutes

749
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:07,690
thank you

750
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:13,670
[Applause]
