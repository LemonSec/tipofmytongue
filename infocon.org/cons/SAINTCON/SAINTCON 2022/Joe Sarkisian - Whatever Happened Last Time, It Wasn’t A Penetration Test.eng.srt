1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
great so whatever happened last time it

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,940
wasn't a penetration test Jose kitchen

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,740
with Den secure lead penetration tester

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,179
there and a manager of a team of about

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,340
six people

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,599
we do all the good stuff

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
this is my broader company wolf and

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
Company PC again out of Boston uh big

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
CPA firm some people might be wondering

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,060
like why would you go to a CBA firm for

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,240
a penetration test this is killing me

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,460
do you have any other inputs

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,720
up here

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
foreign

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,840
this is a new one never had this happen

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,980
before great

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,199
it's the best way to do it

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,579
I guess so all right we're going to have

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,480
to work with this the way it is

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
um so about us

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,880
um I like to say that we're a technical

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,740
team that's like bolted onto the side of

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,040
a 111 year old TPA firm

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
um

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,420
and basically we started a team then

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,659
secure probably about uh

27
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,400
a few months ago we officially got our

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,020
actual title it's just going to keep

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,720
happening I'm going to talk through it

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
and basically we do pen testing we do

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
Advanced security assessments which is

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,340
kind of like our version of red teams I

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,860
mean most people don't need a red team

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,960
so that's kind of our way around like

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,700
being more goal based but not calling it

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,840
a red team because we're not actually

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,759
usually performing on if that makes

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,180
sense we do app pen testing Network pen

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,860
testing threat emulation social

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,259
engineering you name it we do that we'd

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,399
love for you to come to us but that's

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,020
I'm not wanting to know I'm here I'm not

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,880
trying to sell you on anything so with

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
that let's get into why we're

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,899
essentially here

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,119
so how many people in this room have

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,579
ever had to buy or procure penetration

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,799
testing services from

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
a company okay a few hands smattering of

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,080
fans okay so you're gonna

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,400
you're gonna be interested in this talk

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
I think

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,400
so

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,780
it's still a poorly understood by

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,620
clients and practitioners pen testing is

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,959
which I think is kind of a

57
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,480
it's kind of strange to be like decades

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
into this process and it's still kind of

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
like not well understood on what a pen

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,360
test is versus not

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,860
um getting it wrong has serious

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,400
consequences

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,720
so if somebody screws this up and you

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,450
have a false sense of security

65
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,900
[Music]

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,700
there are vendors selling these Services

67
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,260
due to how to actually perform these

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,420
Services as some of the people have had

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,860
to buy a penthouse pen test before

70
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,680
probably no by now

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
uh and it annoys me

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,760
you got another one great

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,879
we'll see

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,760
that we find out if it's my laptop

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,060
come on

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,480
come on please

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,860
hey we'll pass five seconds

78
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,540
awesome all right

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,040
now I can stop being distracted by that

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,579
so

81
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,920
[Music]

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,260
whatever

83
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,420
it's now it's my laptop all right

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,040
uh so this tends to lead to the

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,780
following things

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,379
no my God that we hear from clients like

87
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,120
when we come in right we've had a pen

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,739
test or the clients had a pen test

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,780
before now they're deciding like okay

90
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,519
we're going to use a new vendor uh

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,920
Wolf's going to be that vendor right now

92
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,299
uh what's their process like right

93
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,180
so we find out after we've typically

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,180
done that that pen test for them

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,040
after the fact

96
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,959
we get these response some of these are

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,239
the responses we get from them but we

98
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,200
let you in we often get uh that's not a

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,659
realistic scenario

100
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,540
uh our mssp would have stopped you which

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,339
is one of my favorites

102
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,440
why didn't they

103
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,419
this report does not adequately reflect

104
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,639
our environment

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
but we're tracking that issue

106
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,620
okay

107
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,320
our report was clean last year what

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
happened

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,740
right why didn't the previous vendor

110
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
find this that's actually probably my

111
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,540
favorite response right there now

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,660
why does this happen right

113
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,699
we do our testing

114
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,960
they had some like first Google ads when

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,520
they searched for pen testing on my

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,460
Google uh I need a pen test how much and

117
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,340
it's like 99 for a penetration test

118
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,139
you're like perfect that's the one I'm

119
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,000
buying I didn't know it was so cheap

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,520
what was my sister talking about

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,080
right

122
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,780
so then we come in we do all kinds of

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,419
awful things to them right Holland all

124
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,360
in Earnest uh and they're completely

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,340
full mixed by this entire process okay

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,960
so here's a scenario

127
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,600
company A's Regulators right how many

128
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,460
people in here work for in a regulated

129
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,699
industry like banking uh Healthcare

130
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,660
thing okay a few hands uh

131
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,240
so you're say whatever the industry is

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
you're required to have a pen test right

133
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,380
or it's highly suggested uh whatever it

134
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,979
may be right

135
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,860
um the Big Wigs don't necessarily get

136
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,919
security right so there's not a lot of

137
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,240
budget for this

138
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,580
uh so the company starts looking whoever

139
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,280
gets put in charge of hiring a pen Test

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,039
Company right looks for a cheap vendor

141
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,180
because like we don't have a lot of

142
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,220
budget see soda or whoever top down they

143
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,360
don't get it then why we need this but

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,380
we need this so we're going to do it

145
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,340
right so there are support my God

146
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,660
there are surprisingly tons to choose

147
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,759
from at this price point right I

148
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,020
mentioned to the first page of like

149
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,820
Google results by the way if you're

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,860
going to Google for pen test results go

151
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,960
like four pages deep in Google before

152
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,940
you actually start looking for an actual

153
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,280
company that's going to do pen testing

154
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,979
quick show of hands is it more

155
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,300
distracting for me to keep doing this

156
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,620
and if I just talk through and look at

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,220
the screen that doesn't stop on my end

158
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,600
just keep doing this

159
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,099
all right cool awesome I'll do that

160
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,500
company looks for a cheap vendor like I

161
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,460
said

162
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,319
tongues to shoot well all right now I'm

163
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,860
just gonna unplug

164
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,060
s to choose from at this price point

165
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,419
right they pick the one that is closest

166
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,919
to the cheapest

167
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,199
okay

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,120
who wants to guess how this turns out

169
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,240
I love you

170
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
well we're almost we're almost to that

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,758
part

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,199
and if you were looking at my slides

173
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,880
you'd see an actual dumpster fire going

174
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,919
down the street in a river but since I

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,139
just have to tell you how it looks

176
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,000
so it's a dumpster fire right as you

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,419
might imagine so the pen test finishes

178
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,940
right and the report looks like there's

179
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,380
a couple of options for how the port's

180
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,240
going to come out right so there's

181
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,259
either no findings right ship shape

182
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,560
or there's very few findings how many in

183
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,539
here have ever received a penetration

184
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,099
test report and had to look through the

185
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,599
results

186
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,840
a lot more hands awesome okay

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,780
how many times has that report had

188
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,500
nothing in it well like a critical risk

189
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,039
SSL like V3 vulnerability

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,560
I see a few more hands okay

191
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,900
great how many times have you just had

192
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,940
no findings whatsoever

193
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,319
anybody

194
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,940
okay so you know why they're giving you

195
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,440
that SSL findings because they couldn't

196
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,060
find anything else and they had to put

197
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,440
something in the report

198
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
right

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,419
so the other option which is getting to

200
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:19,800
my friend over here's point about the

201
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,440
NASA scan clearly he's been burned

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,900
is you end up with a massive spreadsheet

203
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,319
like tens of thousands of rows long that

204
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,360
has everything that they found and they

205
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,680
dump it on your desk and say clean

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
yourself up

207
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,240
right that is not a penetration test

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,279
right that is a vulnerability I won't

209
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,080
even call it assessment I'll call it a

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,339
scan because they didn't assess anything

211
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,958
they just ran a scan and gave you the

212
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,919
results

213
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,839
okay so now company a has either

214
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,720
a very false sense of security

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,160
right or they have new job openings

216
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,980
because you just slammed the I.T

217
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,180
Department whoever's in charge of

218
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,920
patching whoever's in charge of asset

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
management whoever's in charge of all

220
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,700
those different things Mal has like six

221
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,980
months more of work for no good reason

222
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,380
and they're looking for the next job at

223
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,820
this point right because you're making

224
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,140
their life a living hell for no reason

225
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,519
which is not all we want

226
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,480
fix it no explanation fix it

227
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,480
so why why did this happen right

228
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
so I imagine you could probably figure

229
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,420
this out

230
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,060
lack of buy-in from the top

231
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,320
okay

232
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,839
leading to lack of budget

233
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
to go with a better vendor

234
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,140
uh probably didn't have enough time if

235
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,459
there's no buy-in from the top anyway

236
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,959
for the person who actually has to go

237
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
procure the pen test to do their due

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
diligence and figure out like who has a

239
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,779
good track record who does not right so

240
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,120
that's part of it sooner with a bad

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,620
vendor right there's not gonna be any

242
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,980
name name calling here right

243
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,140
um poor work false positives even worse

244
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,120
false negatives right leading to

245
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,740
ultimately

246
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,899
a false and security and a possible

247
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,980
breach

248
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,959
right because you're of a false sense of

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,519
security you think you're okay you're

250
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,140
not patching anything you're not

251
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
remediating the infos that are actually

252
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,040
probably highs whereas the highs are

253
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,140
probably actually infos from a NASA scan

254
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,820
I'm sure people have dealt with that

255
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,320
before you're not doing anything because

256
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,940
you think you're good

257
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,120
so Shirley is what happened next time

258
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,380
and this is where I have a cute little

259
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,120
GIF of that same dumpster fire with a

260
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,620
line that says next time pointing to it

261
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,720
right

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,860
so another scenario

263
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,500
company B's Regulators also require an

264
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,620
annual penetration test

265
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,560
the bigwigs understand security

266
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,000
so there's a solid budget for this

267
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,500
they do research how many people in here

268
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,540
the people that have had to do bipent

269
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,920
tests

270
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,019
did you what was it was the method like

271
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,060
I Googled it was it I already knew

272
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,860
because I'd come from another place I'm

273
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,540
just curious if anybody has like what

274
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,040
their process was for procuring the

275
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
penetration testing services the last

276
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,180
time they did it

277
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,360
trial and error okay fair

278
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
so anybody that's had a good one what

279
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,260
was that process did you send that on

280
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,579
RFP

281
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,180
right did you go through people you know

282
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,140
I must I'm guessing you didn't just

283
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,600
Google it right

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
okay

285
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,160
and luckily we do have a a good number

286
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
of good companies that do this now and a

287
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,300
whole lot more that don't so Word of

288
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,279
Mouth can be good

289
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,100
uh so they do their research maybe they

290
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,940
send an RFP right uh to some they might

291
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,380
think might be you might have a good

292
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,880
track record know what they're doing are

293
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,440
going to do quality work

294
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,820
right

295
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,740
there are surprisingly few of these to

296
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,600
choose from and everybody knows what I'm

297
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
talking about right I'll name names I'll

298
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,300
name good names all right so there's

299
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,800
obviously The Trusted sex the Black

300
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,500
Hills is of the world all these places

301
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,060
they're expensive right but they know

302
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,560
what you're doing

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,839
so Company B picks one that makes sense

304
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,760
for them within their budget not bottom

305
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,600
of the barrel probably not

306
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,579
astronomically expensive right if you're

307
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,500
not Fortune 500 Fortune 100 you probably

308
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
don't need to buy like an astronomically

309
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,720
expensive penetration test

310
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,640
uh and this turns out way better right

311
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,760
because now they don't have

312
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,459
uh false sense of security they know

313
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,959
exactly where their holes are they have

314
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,420
buy-in from the top right so when you

315
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,399
give them when you get that laundry list

316
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,500
of criticals highs moderates whatever it

317
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,480
may be they don't say I don't believe

318
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
you right they're like okay we need to

319
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,019
fix this we need to work together uh

320
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,500
yada yada

321
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
so option A

322
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,940
proves risk right so

323
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,120
the person who mentioned that they get

324
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,639
the NASA scan right did that prove

325
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,200
anything to you did you look through

326
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,240
those results at all

327
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,639
like did you look at it and go I can use

328
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,660
this

329
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,180
for actionable information risk was

330
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,500
proven to me

331
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,880
and now I know what I need to do to

332
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,480
secure my network

333
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
sure

334
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,060
right so

335
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,040
was it hard to go through and kind of

336
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
figure out well you should have

337
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,380
prioritized

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,160
sure yeah critical size

339
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,760
thank you

340
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,959
right so the reason I ask is because

341
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,480
when someone when I say prove risk I

342
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
mean that's where we kind of get it

343
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
there was like Volcan versus pen test

344
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,940
right bone scan they do the scan

345
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,500
ideally if it's a vulnerability

346
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,639
assessment it's called that it's not

347
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,440
called a penetration test and what

348
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
they're doing is going through the scan

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,740
results with you pointing out things

350
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,600
that maybe they think the scanner is

351
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,639
over prioritizing based on the risk

352
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,380
Level under prioritizing right they have

353
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,399
that knowledge they're going through

354
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,380
your documents your procedures how do

355
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,880
you track assets how do you scan your

356
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,459
how do you scan your network uh after

357
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,959
you do patching to make sure that those

358
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,639
patches and whatever remediations

359
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,399
applied things like that right the

360
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,139
penetration test is they do they don't

361
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,300
necessarily run a bone scan but they do

362
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
prove Risk by saying okay that thing

363
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,839
that maybe a volt scanner would have

364
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,740
found

365
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm going to actively exploit and show

366
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,220
you what happens when I do

367
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,959
right so that's a big difference between

368
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,380
the two

369
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,820
so

370
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,920
good

371
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,399
say again

372
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,959
um

373
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,720
yeah sure all right I believe you

374
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,139
I trust you

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,620
it doesn't help that the USB's name is

376
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,399
Big dark disc

377
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,018
it Department do not remove

378
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,319
D thanks

379
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,279
I have really good eyes as you could

380
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,939
tell yeah really

381
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,839
take this out you don't want to trip

382
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,800
over that right sure

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,660
no worries

384
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,000
no I'm still writing

385
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,600
hey there we go

386
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,040
no no

387
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,600
that man probably made it through World

388
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,079
War II

389
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,699
pretty straight

390
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,000
okay so this is Apple

391
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,620
and then

392
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,560
that's ethernet if you need that

393
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't

394
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,079
know oh yeah

395
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,880
I'll do dance number

396
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,560
hey

397
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,199
yeah do you mind if I plug this in

398
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
well cool

399
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,019
this is for the conference

400
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,699
it's only connected to like eight jump

401
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,120
boxes

402
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,120
all right

403
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,279
sorry folks

404
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,899
we're supposed to get new laptops soon

405
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,240
now I have a reason now

406
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,759
hit on that

407
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,500
all right I think we're about

408
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,260
right here

409
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,859
yeah turns out well great

410
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,579
so I think this is where I was so

411
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,400
now we have validated useful information

412
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,679
and it helps prove risk good decisions

413
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,980
about budgeting for security right so

414
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,419
there's a client we were doing a pen

415
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,520
test at

416
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,179
um

417
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,520
and they're trying to figure out like

418
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,740
what tools they needed in order to keep

419
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,080
like defense in depth right so what they

420
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,740
had is they had crowdstrike and they had

421
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,240
like uh I don't remember the Knack

422
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,320
solution but they had a network access

423
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,200
code control solution right so we give

424
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,320
them a penetration test report

425
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,840
they detected two things the entire time

426
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,699
who wants to guess what those were

427
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,260
when we Plugged In The Box to their

428
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,340
Network

429
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,919
right and when we tried to dump memory

430
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,260
from lsas on an endpoint

431
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,960
only things they detected okay

432
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,580
so we give them the report

433
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,140
and they go

434
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,179
a lot of the excuses I showed you on the

435
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,039
first couple slides right the thing the

436
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,240
things that we typically hear when

437
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,039
they've had a prior year of pen test it

438
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,020
wasn't much of a pen test right

439
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,559
and they say yeah but we have a knack

440
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,120
I'm like

441
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
okay so that helps you if somebody walks

442
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,100
into your building with an unknown asset

443
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,320
plugs it into your network and then

444
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,760
leaves

445
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,520
you are a local bank

446
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
Ivan from Russia is not coming here to

447
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
do that to you

448
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,360
okay not going to happen not your risk

449
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,260
profile right what may happen someone

450
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,299
sends a phishing email this was not in

451
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,380
scope otherwise we probably would have

452
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,900
done this someone sends a phishing email

453
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,940
the download of malicious payload now

454
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,280
their C2 outbound that's more likely

455
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,160
right every single time I tried to

456
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,299
explain some other risk in the report

457
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,280
that yeah but we have a knack

458
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,320
we had to let you in

459
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,720
and I'm like that's not the point like I

460
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,460
just couldn't get it I couldn't get it

461
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,900
through there's still a client I won't

462
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,820
know death they're trying okay it's just

463
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,840
like

464
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,820
doing stuff like this because we were

465
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,320
new to them is what helps them

466
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
understand these things right it's like

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,860
I understand you have a knack that's

468
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,419
great I understand you have crowd track

469
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,919
that's great what about all the stuff we

470
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,020
did in between right here's where maybe

471
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,700
you could prioritize your budgeting

472
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,980
decisions for next time maybe you need a

473
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,240
password manager maybe you need this

474
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,679
maybe you need that maybe you need a

475
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,760
sensor

476
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,400
on your network to detect an anomalous

477
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,580
or an anomalous traffic right didn't

478
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,780
have any of those things but now they

479
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,100
know okay maybe we should start looking

480
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,080
into this they had a decent budget they

481
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,100
just didn't necessarily know how to use

482
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,860
it that well pen test helps right builds

483
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,080
confidence in the company's people

484
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,640
okay

485
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,500
if you're working if you're getting a

486
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,580
pen test

487
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,260
those people should be working with you

488
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,360
to be like hey you're doing a good job

489
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,700
in some of these places right we're not

490
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,679
just going to tear you apart

491
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
tell you you stink and then leave right

492
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,179
we're going to say hey you're doing this

493
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,620
right right your users didn't

494
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,000
necessarily fall for a fish or if they

495
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,980
did they reported it right away right

496
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,039
you detected net like in map traffic I

497
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,299
can't tell you how many times I've been

498
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,740
to clients and like they don't detect

499
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,660
Network traffic like weird nmap Network

500
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,100
traffic which is really strange to me

501
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,480
which is another topic we'll do in a

502
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,919
second

503
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,440
um and then forb stakeholders right and

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,760
informs people about the esoteric

505
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,799
aspects of security like we like to come

506
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,600
in and try to put this in like simple

507
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,940
terms for people to understand

508
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,740
um so that when we come back ideally

509
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,179
when we come back next time they have a

510
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,260
better understanding of why we do what

511
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,179
we do

512
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,100
uh there is no option b because this

513
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,840
went well

514
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,940
so now they have a solid reference point

515
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,100
right they have a team that's bought in

516
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,679
which is the most important part is that

517
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,120
there's culture that starts to build

518
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,140
here

519
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,000
and there's less likelihood of a nasty

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
breach obviously I'm going to say you're

521
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,299
not going to get one

522
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,679
so

523
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,840
my kind of takeaways here

524
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,980
uh do not shop for the lowest cost

525
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,000
provider

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,980
we've been over this you're not going to

527
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,780
get a pen test how many people here get

528
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,780
like a ton of emails if you're like a

529
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,200
like a managerial level level or above

530
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
maybe not even

531
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,980
from like these services do like uh

532
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,080
automated pen tests

533
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,900
like we have ai powered pen test saw a

534
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,039
couple hands

535
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,440
okay there's nothing necessarily wrong

536
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,960
with those as long as you are augmenting

537
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,780
them with a human version like once a

538
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,340
year right there's nothing wrong with

539
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,059
that

540
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,640
but I'm not going to poo poo it

541
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,280
but those things sometimes claim to be

542
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,039
like relatively cheap to use

543
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,720
I don't want to know how they look I

544
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,860
know there's one that's basically just

545
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,200
who here is a pen tester is anybody

546
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,240
that's an actual pen tester

547
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,340
I see like one end in the back two hands

548
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,860
you guys heard a crack map exec

549
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,039
right there's a tool that basically uses

550
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,020
that and calls it something else so uses

551
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,000
open source software and then does an

552
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,039
automated pen test using it and calls it

553
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,539
like their product

554
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,039
if you look it up on Twitter you'll find

555
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,400
it there's it's a huge heated debate uh

556
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,620
look into the vendors you're considering

557
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,720
right we all know the the Black Hills

558
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,280
The Trusted sex like I said but like

559
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,260
look if you're if you can't afford a pen

560
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,820
test from them or just doesn't make

561
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,400
sense right look into the look into the

562
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,220
ones you might be considering right so

563
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,659
give them a call right their sales

564
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,100
people will be happy to talk you don't

565
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,000
necessarily want to talk to this Hills

566
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,799
Kai you want to talk to like an SME if

567
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,820
they'll put you on the phone with one

568
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,419
right that'll help you

569
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,720
ask for references right if you ask

570
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,000
let's say you do RFP right you send it

571
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,679
out part of that you ask for references

572
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,299
if they don't have any that should

573
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,860
probably be a flag right if you don't

574
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,900
have a trusted uh client that you've

575
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,039
done good work for that they're really

576
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,440
happy with like I found I want to go

577
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,539
back go to bat for you right if no

578
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,039
clients are willing to go to bat for you

579
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,020
for whoever you're you're potentially

580
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,460
going to buy from

581
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,380
might be a little I mean they might say

582
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,120
the thing with like oh we don't divulge

583
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
like who are who we were but like that

584
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
in some ways is a cop-out

585
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,059
especially when it's part of this

586
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,440
process

587
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,600
uh pay attention to communication right

588
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,340
do they ask any questions about your

589
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,900
environment right

590
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,600
when you do a pen test ideally

591
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,880
after it's bought

592
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,740
the actual testers are going to get on

593
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,640
the phone

594
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,100
with their points of contact at the

595
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,539
client they're doing the pen test for it

596
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,460
and say tell us about your environment

597
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,380
what are you worried about what keeps

598
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,780
you up at night what kind of scope do

599
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,020
you want here right what shouldn't we do

600
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,360
say again

601
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,220
I mean that's every single call right if

602
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,500
we're doing social engineering whatever

603
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,400
oh you're saying like it's being

604
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
malicious I see what you're saying

605
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,600
no it's it's known right so we we reach

606
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,039
out hey we want to get up the scope call

607
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,140
you want to give us a call to verify as

608
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,400
first to make sure we know who we are

609
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,159
right but it's part of the process

610
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,360
we want to know about the environment

611
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,340
before we start banging away at it has

612
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,720
anybody ever had a penthouse where it

613
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,760
knocked down like a network segment

614
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,740
because they didn't know that they

615
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,080
didn't ask questions about the network

616
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,939
maybe a hand or two yeah I see one

617
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,340
uh did they tell you about their process

618
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,380
so who here knows what assumed breach is

619
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,419
has anybody heard that term a couple of

620
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,520
the same hands okay that's good

621
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,140
we talk about that right this is what it

622
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,880
means and that helps to alleviate the

623
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,980
problem of but we have a knack

624
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,080
right because I'm telling you I'm

625
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,580
putting a device on your network to do

626
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
this testing

627
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,940
we can test your Knack I can plug that

628
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,740
thing in and if it stops me great okay

629
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,960
now let me undo my work

630
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
right assume breach that somebody's

631
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,740
already in there so if we're using a a

632
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,120
box if we're using a Windows host

633
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,700
whatever we may be doing right we're

634
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,159
assuming someone's already in right so

635
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,240
we're and we're putting that in the

636
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,740
report by the way that's going on the

637
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,220
executive summary so that when the

638
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,860
executive reads it they know that going

639
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,200
in like this isn't the massive dumpster

640
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,520
fire you thought it was because he led

641
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,799
us in to do the rest of the stuff right

642
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,559
uh do you know who's doing the work

643
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,600
like do you know who the testers are

644
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,640
I found something out the other day well

645
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
not the other day so a few weeks ago I

646
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,360
was talking to another pen tester at

647
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,460
another consulting firm he's been doing

648
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,960
it way longer than me and he's like you

649
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,980
know

650
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,140
I'm really surprised that you guys like

651
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,659
do your pen testing in-house I'm like

652
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,580
what are you talking about he's like I'm

653
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,500
pretty sure that you're the only CPA

654
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,080
firm I can think of in this region that

655
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
does not 1099 out their penetration

656
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,380
testing work

657
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,120
and I was kind of Blown Away by that

658
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,340
right so so

659
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,340
are you getting 1099ers or are you

660
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,600
getting people that actually work for

661
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,840
the penetration testing consultancy

662
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,700
that are doing that work and are part of

663
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,840
a team

664
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,940
are wanting to be a part of that process

665
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,440
going over and above because they

666
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,700
actually have that on they're going to

667
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,120
have that ongoing relationship right

668
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
1099 is probably not so much right it's

669
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,919
very sexy and snazzy now to say that you

670
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,380
provide penetration testing services

671
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,659
so if you can just put us like literally

672
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,400
a page on your website says we provide

673
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,380
pen testing okay

674
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,539
but who's doing it

675
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,419
right are they vetted you can't it's

676
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:13,919
kind of hard to be like oh we're going

677
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,539
to 10.99 this work but we're also going

678
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,919
to vet these people before they come in

679
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,140
the door that they're not actually

680
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,480
uh some nut job that's gonna go hog on

681
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,700
somebody's Network steal their data etc

682
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,419
etc right

683
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,559
so I want to go back to the whole

684
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,480
list that I had at the beginning and

685
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,279
kind of go through based on where we are

686
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,340
now again but we let you in the process

687
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,140
was explained up front assume reach

688
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,059
right that should take care of that

689
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,299
question

690
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,419
usually

691
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,340
that's not a realistic scenario

692
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,840
well if the last people have formed a

693
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,039
scan and called it a pen test and you're

694
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,820
100 correct

695
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,100
our mssp would have stopped you did you

696
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
tell us tell them we're coming

697
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,640
right

698
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,340
if not why didn't they stop us

699
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,640
okay so this is where I go on my little

700
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,039
mssp soapbox rant and I again will not

701
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,600
name any names here okay

702
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,400
obviously like probably everybody in

703
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,020
this room the company worked for that

704
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,659
you're working for have some type of a

705
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,460
security provider that's supposed to be

706
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,860
performing some type of monitoring or

707
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,039
blocking or Sim services or whatever it

708
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,900
may be right it's ubiquitous it's

709
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,400
ubiquitous these days we do a lot of

710
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,140
work for financial institutions

711
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,900
Healthcare uh

712
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,539
some startups but like all of these

713
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,520
places are offloading like there's their

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,600
sock

715
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,640
um yeah their sock like a lot of their

716
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,380
monitoring detection response things

717
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,360
like that right

718
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,539
there's a lot of times when we're doing

719
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,600
very basic run-of-the-mill testing

720
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,700
that has been known about forever and

721
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,380
it's silence on the wire from the mssp

722
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,320
right and we make that a finding and we

723
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,480
get some angry clients when we make that

724
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,240
a finding and the finding isn't you know

725
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,120
oh this is your fault why didn't you

726
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,279
detect this right the thing is you're

727
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,440
paying somebody a lot of money to detect

728
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,440
this stuff why didn't they right so

729
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,120
what's the recommendation of the finding

730
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,500
more or less pick up the phone and

731
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,960
figure out why like what are you paying

732
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,580
for right do you know what's on the

733
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,200
contract do you know what they're

734
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,700
supposed to be monitoring is it just

735
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,740
domain controllers God I hope not

736
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,120
just member servers and domain

737
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,919
controllers is it work state is it

738
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
everything workstations whatever iot

739
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,580
whatever it may be right

740
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,740
now do you have sensors where they're

741
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,020
supposed to be to be able to pick up bad

742
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,620
traffic right what Integrations does

743
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,620
your mssp have on endpoints right let's

744
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,960
say you have crowdstrike

745
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
are they monitoring crowdstrike who's

746
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,500
monitoring crowdstrike is it just is it

747
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,799
just like your it team of two people

748
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,900
that probably can't handle all of that

749
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
right what are they what are they being

750
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,460
paid for we've had we have a situation

751
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,380
where the

752
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,440
previous

753
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,179
CIO of a company

754
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,500
had bought and had signed an mssp uh I

755
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,880
think it was like a it's a long Contour

756
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,080
it's like five years

757
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,200
right yeah it was a long contract

758
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,559
this guy left like two two years later

759
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,820
for those of you who are into math

760
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,899
there's three years left in that

761
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,600
contract the new CIO comes in has

762
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,980
literally no idea what's in that

763
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,240
contract doesn't know what's supposed to

764
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,799
be happening so we started doing the

765
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,640
test saying we're like dude there's

766
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
nothing here I don't know what to tell

767
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,779
you and luckily they didn't get mad at

768
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,740
us they were like okay we're gonna pick

769
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,360
up the phone we're gonna figure out why

770
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,559
this is happening

771
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,419
the part that sucked

772
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:43,740
was that

773
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
unbeknownst to me he wanted to have a

774
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,120
meeting with the team and his team and

775
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,580
guess who was in that meeting with us

776
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,500
the mssp

777
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,120
and now he's looking at them going why

778
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,500
didn't you detect all this stuff that

779
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,940
they did and I'm like this is not a

780
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
position I want to be in at all that's

781
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,620
happened a couple of times but at least

782
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,360
there's the conversation now right now

783
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,340
you can start to understand like

784
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,960
okay yeah they're we're paying for

785
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,220
something we're not getting it where are

786
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,840
the holes okay do we have to pay you

787
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,340
more money are we paying you money we're

788
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,779
already should be paying you and you're

789
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,640
not doing it what what is going on here

790
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,740
and let's try to fix this because if

791
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,120
we're not we're there for like a week or

792
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,340
two right what else is being missed for

793
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,220
the rest of the year potentially

794
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,080
all right I'm going to get off my

795
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,740
soapbox now

796
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,059
oh actually no I'm gonna get back up on

797
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,559
it for a second it's not always the

798
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,419
mssp's fault

799
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,179
right like maybe they literally aren't

800
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,100
being paid enough money or there isn't

801
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,840
enough sensors in place you just they

802
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,640
provided what was paid for and maybe the

803
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,840
client needs to be like okay we need to

804
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,980
think about upping this or changing

805
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,899
something right another one more mature

806
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,340
makes more sense you got more money more

807
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,000
budget whatever whatever

808
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,620
this report does not adequately reflect

809
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,960
our environment

810
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
well

811
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,260
the previous vendor did they ask you

812
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,360
about your environment

813
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,520
right

814
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,380
did they check in with you throughout

815
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,299
testing to see like okay I did this

816
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,779
thing did you see it if so is it an

817
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,159
alert can you send me the alert I'll put

818
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,299
in the report for you give you credit

819
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,620
right what I will say is that if I ask

820
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,740
for an alert and you send me a rolled up

821
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,880
35 page PDF of just like events

822
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,159
I'm going to hand that right back to you

823
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,960
and say thank you very much this is not

824
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,919
an alert

825
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,419
right

826
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,799
but there needs to be that back and

827
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,080
forth constantly right like like during

828
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
a pen test like there has to be that

829
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,740
communication or that's where things

830
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,140
break down clients get mad they don't

831
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,340
want to come back they're not getting

832
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,779
value out of it

833
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,260
etc etc

834
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,919
but we're tracking that issue

835
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,720
status meetings should be having should

836
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,659
be should have should be have oh my God

837
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,880
should be taking place to avoid this

838
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,520
problem right

839
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,580
I shouldn't be providing a status we did

840
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,779
this we did this we did this we did this

841
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:09,659
we did this and then like people we we

842
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,360
gave you our our remediation tracking

843
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,559
and our exceptions all that stuff did

844
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,600
you read it right that shouldn't happen

845
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,220
we have a compensating control okay what

846
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,360
is it okay great I'm going to take

847
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
another report now I'm not going to hit

848
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,240
you with it

849
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,620
our report was cleaning last year

850
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,020
probably because your company a

851
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,240
and you went with a lower cost provider

852
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,260
why didn't the previous funder find this

853
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,179
there is no good answer for this

854
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,640
question from me

855
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,880
I have no idea I can ask questions right

856
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,380
I don't want to be put in a position to

857
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,240
have to to badmouth anybody that did I

858
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,679
like I don't know what the situation was

859
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,600
I don't know what the scope was I don't

860
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,520
know what the fee was right I don't know

861
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,020
any of that stuff

862
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,059
but did they have a scope call with you

863
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,220
do they talk about their process

864
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,600
it's an impossible question to answer

865
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,980
so questions to ask the vendor we went

866
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,440
over this a little bit already but we'll

867
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,120
talk about it again

868
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,039
do you perform a bone scanner appendage

869
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,679
if so what is it used for there's not

870
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:11,880
anything necessarily wrong with

871
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,380
performing a volt scan as part of a pen

872
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,419
test especially on a big Network

873
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,279
but it needs to be clear what it's being

874
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,539
used for right if they're asking you for

875
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,220
uh administrative credentials to run

876
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,779
that scan

877
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,460
are those credentials going to be used

878
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,899
to do the pen tests because that's

879
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:28,980
cheating

880
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,120
holy crap is that shooting

881
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
what's it used for

882
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,059
do you attempt exploitation of

883
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:37,500
vulnerabilities found

884
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,059
they say no

885
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,919
it's not a pen test

886
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,460
period

887
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,779
how much focus is on ad and identity

888
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,940
as opposed to spending a week trying to

889
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,440
pound a hole

890
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
in our like hardened Palo Alto on the

891
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,559
perimeter

892
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,580
right

893
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,620
kind of a useless exercise in this day

894
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,659
and age right perimeters everywhere we

895
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,279
use that Microsoft 365 they got VPN

896
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,820
logins they've got RDP they've got all

897
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,740
kinds of different remote gateways

898
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,580
right Microsoft 365 to me is like one of

899
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,899
the first places I go if I'm doing an

900
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,460
external penetration test how's your

901
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,320
conditional access policy using MFA for

902
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,159
everybody

903
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,320
is everybody enrolled in MFA and

904
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,000
required to as soon as it's pushed out

905
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,520
or within X period of time I was on a

906
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,280
pen test recently where they had MFA and

907
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,080
they're like everybody has MFA I'm like

908
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,199
okay

909
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,918
guess some credentials with a password

910
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,679
spray go to login I'm presented with the

911
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,418
screen that says it's time to enroll in

912
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,500
MFA

913
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,020
like perfect

914
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,760
now I'm that person because now that's

915
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,560
my phone number going in and I let's

916
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,080
count account takeover

917
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,020
so there needs to be focus on that right

918
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,179
like this is this is this is this is the

919
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,560
problem these days is identity

920
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,580
can we see a sample report

921
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,200
we have sample reports a lot of good

922
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,640
places have similar reports call them up

923
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,839
they'll ask you for and ask them for

924
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,160
them they'll just give it to you right

925
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,080
there's no client data in there they're

926
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,460
not trying to hide anything like this is

927
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,780
our product we're proud of it this is

928
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,200
what you get

929
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,320
we went over this 1099ers or are they

930
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,520
actually employees right

931
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,680
what kinds of ongoing training do they

932
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
do

933
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,200
right do they have a training what's

934
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,280
their do they have a good training

935
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,780
budget like what if maybe what have you

936
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,800
gone what conferences have you gone to

937
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,300
this year like what are you know like

938
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,579
what are they I hate to say like what

939
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,260
search do they have but unfortunately

940
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,400
that's the world we live in and

941
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,960
sometimes that's necessary depending

942
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
upon the type of organization you have

943
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,040
to be this type of accreditation or all

944
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,599
your people have to be oscps or whatever

945
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,500
it may be right

946
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,339
what's your fishing process like

947
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,579
all right so one more little soapbox

948
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,020
how many people in here think that

949
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,599
clicks or sorry click rate

950
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,660
is the best uh

951
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,060
the best way to understand how liable

952
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,500
your people are to social engineering

953
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,680
smart group not a single hand

954
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,540
good

955
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,000
clicks or clicks but like what did they

956
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,079
do after that

957
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,240
right did they sorry

958
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,020
say a little more

959
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,420
high value Target information like like

960
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,180
your executive what's their quick rate

961
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,079
versus

962
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,220
better

963
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,660
yeah no I mean that is a little bit

964
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,040
better what I wanted to what I do want

965
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,420
to say though is

966
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,099
if they click people are trying to click

967
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,720
especially people in sales marketing

968
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,800
whatever they're constantly talking to

969
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
people that don't work for the actual

970
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,400
organization right that little external

971
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,859
thing that says this email came from

972
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,240
outside of your organization I don't

973
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,220
care if it's in 112 Point font bright

974
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,680
red and bold right sooner or later

975
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,660
people don't even see it

976
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,280
right especially like I said the people

977
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,420
are constantly dealing with outside

978
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,079
vendors uh and third parties right it's

979
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,820
a it's a part of a control but defense

980
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,339
and depth right so when they inevitably

981
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,440
click on something inevitably give up

982
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
credentials download something they

983
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,619
shouldn't fire it off whatever it may be

984
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,839
what is the culture like

985
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,300
right in order to like

986
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,940
basically like I'm still going on a

987
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,200
soapbox here

988
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,300
the culture of can they report without

989
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,800
having to feel bad about reporting if

990
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
they get it wrong right people need to

991
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,440
be able to report they need to be able

992
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
to put themselves out there and say hey

993
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,839
I think this is bad I'm trying to

994
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,900
protect the company right so if what do

995
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,040
you ask what is your fishing process

996
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,240
like and they go oh we track clicks

997
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,300
we'll give you uh The Click rate and uh

998
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,599
who did it right it's kind of a flag in

999
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,920
my opinion because you're not really

1000
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,940
getting much out of that like of course

1001
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,440
people click

1002
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,240
I don't know if anybody was in uh the

1003
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,339
keynote talks this morning but a whole

1004
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,020
lot of discussion about this was snows

1005
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,859
talk which is great

1006
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,859
that's my time more or less

1007
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,359
um I wanted to ask if there are any

1008
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,040
questions I know we're wrapping up a

1009
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,700
little bit early here anybody anything

1010
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,419
don't be afraid

1011
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,180
must have been a good talk then sorry go

1012
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,120
ahead

1013
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,279
[Music]

1014
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,040
um and we'd have to answer our customers

1015
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,359
when they'd say hey you've got some

1016
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,880
vulnerability in your software

1017
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,540
um and and those companies that do that

1018
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,800
vulnerability scan without actually

1019
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,260
doing the penetration testing all of our

1020
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,800
fixes were back ported fixes and so we

1021
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,900
didn't you know it say it's version this

1022
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,119
but it has the backboarded fixes in it

1023
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,800
and then they were reporting that it was

1024
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,500
vulnerable right and because of doing

1025
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,020
that type of scan all it did was create

1026
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,060
a mountain of paper right that our

1027
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,220
company had to do and their company had

1028
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,460
to do to satisfy the regulations right

1029
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,000
to go get a vulnerability scan

1030
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,220
it sure so if you pay for a cheap

1031
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,260
service that's going to

1032
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,880
you're going to pay with other things

1033
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
like your time your vendors now

1034
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,800
that's a very good point

1035
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,119
I don't know if everybody heard that or

1036
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,320
not but

1037
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,500
basically the gist is if you pay for

1038
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,660
a vulnerability assessment that's not

1039
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,339
really or you think it's a pen basically

1040
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,780
you think it might be a pen test but it

1041
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,880
turns out to be a volt scan is that that

1042
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
type of thing right you're not

1043
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,460
necessarily proving risk you're just

1044
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,079
handing over a spreadsheet because you

1045
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,760
it's regulatory like you had to do this

1046
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,800
whatever it may be

1047
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,260
it might be cheap to do that and his

1048
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,339
point was

1049
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,900
think of how much you're going to pay

1050
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,839
down the road in wasted time resources

1051
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,940
making your pissing off your employees

1052
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,160
right maybe like I said one of them

1053
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,180
leaves because they just can't take it

1054
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,579
anymore now you have to figure out

1055
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,440
yeah now you have to pay to hire again

1056
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,900
that's not cheap right so just really

1057
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
good point sure

1058
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,740
yeah go ahead yep

1059
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,839
meaning so the question is how do we

1060
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,820
I serious and yeah so we do have that

1061
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,440
like we'll get non-profits and smaller

1062
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,640
companies like that like hey we want to

1063
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,780
get a pen test right it's not

1064
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,220
necessarily regulatory it's just because

1065
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,140
somebody on the somebody there was like

1066
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,240
hey we have a lot of like sensitive

1067
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,380
information about people we should

1068
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,280
probably figure out how we're doing

1069
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,700
right and the question I think is how do

1070
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,260
they receive the results compared to

1071
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,920
like a regulated client is that kind of

1072
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,900
the gist of it

1073
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,560
yeah so I oftentimes they're

1074
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,540
they are

1075
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,700
Mo they don't have the budget right that

1076
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,280
like a regulated place might and so

1077
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,500
there's more holes right there's maybe a

1078
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,480
little bit more like you know like paper

1079
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,920
shock like as we're going we're not

1080
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,119
again we're not just like not saying

1081
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,859
anything and then at the end of the two

1082
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,599
weeks being like look at all this awful

1083
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,640
stuff right we're talking to them but as

1084
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,900
it's going on they're like oh my God I

1085
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,160
didn't realize or this or that you know

1086
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,260
what I mean so it's like but I will say

1087
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,839
that I think and I don't know if what's

1088
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,839
the function of but those smaller shops

1089
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,180
that like don't necessarily have to but

1090
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,220
want to are more bought into the process

1091
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,740
a lot of the time like up front

1092
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,480
if that's kind of if that answers your

1093
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,339
question I mean I just think if people

1094
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,020
have a if people are thinking about

1095
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,220
these things then they're more willing

1096
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,599
to take the bad news that they think

1097
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,280
might be coming anyway in order to like

1098
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,660
get ahead of it so it's not a problem

1099
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,800
later

1100
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,840
go ahead

1101
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,949
[Music]

1102
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,780
so when we have new clients

1103
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,520
um we'll ask them like okay like how do

1104
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,839
you want to handle scope here what do

1105
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,940
you what what's most important like

1106
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,619
um I don't know

1107
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,099
right and it's like okay that's fine uh

1108
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,859
so maybe what works for you is we get on

1109
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,720
your network right if there's anything

1110
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,980
you're afraid that we're gonna break

1111
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,140
like let us know I mean one of my

1112
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,060
colleagues is a big fan of like chaos

1113
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,980
theory like testing that there's never

1114
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,859
the best time to test if it breaks it

1115
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,260
breaks I he and I go back and forth

1116
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,240
about that a little bit depending upon

1117
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,980
the industry the business like their

1118
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,119
what their uptime has to be whatever

1119
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,920
right but

1120
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,599
um I think

1121
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,359
that you know generally speaking

1122
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,180
new clients are much more like I don't

1123
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,500
know just like let's start somewhere

1124
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,420
like show us what the holes are so

1125
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,680
there'll be a lot of active directory

1126
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,339
misconfigurations right weak passwords

1127
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,440
uh poor password policies right minimum

1128
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,740
of a characters uh bad lockout policy

1129
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,900
like you can try seven times in 30

1130
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,460
minutes and then it'll reset right so

1131
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,900
like passwords brings the problem on the

1132
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,180
perimeter all that kind of like low

1133
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,520
quote unquote low-hanging fruit is where

1134
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,859
we kind of start from and then ideally

1135
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,960
if they come back next year ideally they

1136
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,280
took our recommendations they hardened

1137
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,619
some stuff that's like okay

1138
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,420
can you check all that stuff again and

1139
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,520
we've got this new thing over here we

1140
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,020
want you to poke at right and like maybe

1141
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,400
skip a little bit differently and then

1142
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,240
like

1143
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,119
ideally over the years it's you're going

1144
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,800
like this and there's there's it gets

1145
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,240
more narrow and it's like okay we're

1146
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,859
locked down here thank you for that now

1147
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,380
let's you know as we grow and put new

1148
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,920
things in test those things right

1149
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,640
sure

1150
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,640
you'll get a different quality of

1151
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,940
them so how do you test for that before

1152
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,099
so are you saying are you saying from

1153
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,859
like if I if I let's say our team or

1154
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,339
comes in after some like uh pen Test

1155
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:39,800
Company X has been there the year before

1156
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,339
and then how to

1157
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,420
so you're saying when we're when

1158
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,900
with a company comes in they do a pen

1159
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,099
test and one pen tester is amazing ah

1160
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,579
it's funny

1161
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,200
you're the second person to ask me that

1162
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,420
and like somebody the last time I gave

1163
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,500
this talk asked me the exact same

1164
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,720
question question is how do you

1165
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,240
essentially like grow as a team I'm

1166
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,200
gonna put this in slightly different

1167
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,880
framing how do you essentially grow as

1168
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,740
like a pen test team where you might

1169
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,200
have like you know some rock star do it

1170
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,880
one year and then the next year like

1171
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,260
because we're growing and we have new

1172
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,400
pen testers like they have to start

1173
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,720
somewhere so now you get the junior

1174
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,859
person

1175
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,579
and if those results are and the idea is

1176
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,800
in a perfect world

1177
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,200
you have a senior who is kind of

1178
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,240
overseeing the work of the junior right

1179
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,579
so it's like typical consultancy type of

1180
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,440
type of levels right you have like it's

1181
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,300
like I'm the manager lead pen tester of

1182
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,720
the group right I have a I have uh a

1183
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,460
senior right below me who I kind of

1184
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,500
almost consider me because he's very

1185
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,260
good he he's got it all down right

1186
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,900
then we've got one other senior who's a

1187
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,800
little bit newer and we got a couple

1188
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,260
Juniors right those Juniors shouldn't be

1189
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,480
on pen test by themselves right they

1190
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,000
need that time to like learn from us to

1191
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
grow to learn and one of the most

1192
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,940
important things right is not to

1193
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,099
technical skill necessarily like

1194
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,660
you can learn that but it's like

1195
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,460
understanding like what's couth and

1196
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,839
uncouth when you're speaking to clients

1197
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,540
how to talk about their environment not

1198
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,020
to say in a in a finding like uh all

1199
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,000
your your asset management process sucks

1200
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,280
like you don't you're not gonna say that

1201
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,839
but like you'll be like it's very bad

1202
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,900
like words like very and weak and like

1203
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,339
there's there's there are ways to frame

1204
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,619
things in order to come across right so

1205
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,300
to us it's like communication is huge

1206
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,920
with Juniors

1207
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,300
um we're going to be on scope calls with

1208
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,920
them we're not going to let them

1209
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,319
I shouldn't say this I would be lying to

1210
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,220
you all if I said hiccups don't happen

1211
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,020
sometimes emergency happens Junior ends

1212
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,940
up on a call by themselves sometimes

1213
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,040
that's their time to shine ideally right

1214
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,780
things happen but they shouldn't be

1215
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,859
doing all the testing by themselves

1216
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,540
we're always available if they have a

1217
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,560
problem and they can't figure something

1218
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,940
out it's like hey I've seen you guys do

1219
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,140
this attack I think it's here can you

1220
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,520
help me out right so that when you get

1221
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,440
that report at the end of the day it

1222
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,420
should be like anybody else on the team

1223
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,500
wrote it whether it's like me seniors it

1224
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,720
should look just as good as any like

1225
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,960
there should be no like good versus

1226
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,920
so-sover's bad you know what I mean

1227
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,060
depending upon the person that did it it

1228
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,800
should all be same good quality does

1229
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,420
that answer the question

1230
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,420
foreign

1231
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,720
oh

1232
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,099
I say

1233
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,359
so something tells me that's happened to

1234
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,500
you before okay

1235
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,880
radically I

1236
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,280
right

1237
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,119
so I'll be very honest and say I

1238
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,220
I'm fortunate and that

1239
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,280
my team and our big bosses like don't

1240
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
want that to happen either so like

1241
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,660
we don't just let somebody do like

1242
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,700
whatever they want the next year they

1243
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,920
have the prior year report right and so

1244
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,900
they okay part of our thing is you take

1245
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,640
the prior year report and let's say

1246
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,780
there's management comments in there

1247
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,579
from the client and it says we will fix

1248
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:03,900
this by X date this is the person

1249
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,579
responsible whatever or here's our

1250
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,200
compensating control we're going to put

1251
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,640
that in by I don't know two months from

1252
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,619
now right okay we're gonna test that

1253
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,260
next year and if you fixed it and you

1254
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,000
said you fixed it great if you said you

1255
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,500
fixed it you didn't

1256
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,579
problem right so there has to be that

1257
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,260
level of like even if it's a junior

1258
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,119
they're going through the prior report

1259
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,579
and making sure all of those check boxes

1260
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,140
are checked before they start looking

1261
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,140
for other things right and again they're

1262
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,180
checking in with us as seniors as

1263
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,740
managers whatever to make sure that

1264
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,060
they're not wasting time they're not in

1265
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,800
a rabbit hole it doesn't matter right

1266
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,420
they didn't run a bone scan and be like

1267
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,220
I'm going to exploit this Specter

1268
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,440
vulnerability it's like no you're not

1269
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,960
like stop stop wasting your time is that

1270
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,760
a better answer

1271
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,700
we can talk after I'll be around if I

1272
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,700
maybe I'm just not fully grasping uh do

1273
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,800
I have time for one more question

1274
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,480
yeah if there's one more question I can

1275
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,980
take it if not you can't

1276
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,460
way in the back

1277
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,060
unless it's asked for specifically now

1278
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,099
we have we do vulnerability assessments

1279
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,880
that's a separate thing

1280
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,520
no problem

1281
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,460
one more quick one we're good

1282
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,260
I'll be outside after if anybody's want

1283
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,500
to talk all right thanks guys

1284
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,110
[Applause]
