1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
okay

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,700
so I have to admit I'm kind of excited

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,720
about this talk

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,000
because like I said in the description

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if I could talk to myself 12 years ago

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
I would have said this is a thing be

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,740
ready to feel it

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,420
and then I would have grappled with it

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,640
for a couple years and uh

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
not like myself and then I've talked

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,859
enough therapists that I'm okay with it

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,619
um does anyone in here feel like at some

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,640
point in their life they've felt

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,599
imposter syndrome

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,100
every day

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
all right

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,280
okay so first off

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,000
uh of me uh this is me

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,280
so you can do a recognition that's black

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
and white this is color

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,379
I'm a husband to one dad to five for Dad

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,200
to two they're both dogs

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,360
uh I I like cats but I can never eat a

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,739
whole one

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,739
I am neurodivergent I have ADHD just

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,559
like most of you and I am on the autism

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,899
spectrum like many of you

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,060
you just might not know it

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,520
uh I'm adopted

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,100
which brings another challenge to the

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,340
Imposter syndrome when and this is a

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,880
real thing uh before you have words as

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,560
an infant

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,500
when your mother you've come to know her

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,720
heartbeat and her smell and her sound

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,420
and then she gives you away and you

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,979
can't say anything about it you can't

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,320
express it all you have is the the the

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,540
the trauma

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,299
you feel like an imposter you feel like

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,220
no one loves you

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,500
it's tough I still feel that today it's

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,360
tough

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,000
um I support minorities in Tech I think

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,860
we have too many pasty white guys and I

46
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,079
am a pasty white guy

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,560
I love lgbtq people I think around here

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,420
they don't get enough love and

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,720
I do love them and all my hugs are free

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,360
but you have to ask for them I will not

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,600
just hug you you have to ask

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,579
um we're going to talk about what is an

53
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,860
imposter what is imposter syndrome who

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,598
feels imposter syndrome

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,239
give you a hint everyone how do I know

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,120
if I'm feeling it how does it manifest

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,819
what should I do about imposter syndrome

58
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,459
who didn't feel imposter syndrome but

59
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,620
should have

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,200
and this is important and then stop

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,420
comparing congratulate yourself

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,640
and here's a disclaimer I am not a

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,520
therapist I am not a psychologist or a

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,099
psychiatrist I have spoken with many of

65
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,920
these types of people but I am not I

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
don't play one on TV

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,900
um I'm not a doctor I'm not a lawyer I'm

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,480
nothing I'm just an infosec guy

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,540
okay what is an imposter this is a

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,580
definition of what an imposter is it's

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,140
someone who's going to be sneaking in

72
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,120
they pretend to be someone or not social

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,340
engineer or someone

74
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,780
um

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,420
Jason Street going through the bank he's

76
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,400
doing the USB audits

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,739
he's impo he's he's an imposter he's not

78
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,120
I.T guy

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,580
that's an imposter he doesn't belong

80
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,379
there

81
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,680
but imposter syndrome is a real thing it

82
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,519
is a psychological effect where someone

83
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,379
doubts their skills their talents or

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,400
accomplishments and they have a

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,280
persistent internalized fear of being

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,540
exposed as a fraud

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,099
now a lot of people think they this is

88
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,680
in their career you had it in school

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,420
you might still have it today do you

90
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,040
remember the dreams you have where

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,720
you're speaking and your teeth are

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,280
falling out

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,560
no one cares but you like you can't

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
catch them they're all over the place

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
you can't get your teeth

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
your subconscious does not trust the

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,860
words you are speaking

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
your dreams where you go to school or

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,860
work naked

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,480
it's not a sex dream

101
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,180
because no one there cares

102
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,819
you're going because you don't belong

103
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,280
you're naked because your subconscious

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,140
says you don't belong there your

105
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,480
subconscious believes you are an

106
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,099
imposter

107
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,780
it sucks

108
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,060
because those dreams are the worst you

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,620
wake up and you just you're frazzled you

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,298
don't know what to do

111
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,180
it really it's very unsettling

112
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,639
it's imposter syndrome you felt it in

113
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,919
school you feel it at work you'll feel

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,479
it in relationships it's brutal

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,000
so who feels imposter serum I asked

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
earlier

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,440
I have asked my doctors they feel

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,940
imposter syndrome

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,460
I've asked my lawyers they feel imposter

120
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,919
syndrome I have asked past professors

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,620
they feel imposter syndrome I've asked

122
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,720
my father he feels imposter syndrome

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,460
about being a parent

124
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,000
I have asked ecclesiastical leaders they

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
feel imposter syndrome I used to run a

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,620
con I felt imposter syndrome I should

127
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
not be running a con

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,580
I know Jupiter feels imposter syndrome I

129
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,259
know the entire staff of this Con feels

130
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,479
imposter syndrome I know all of you feel

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,580
imposter syndrome did anyone did anyone

132
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,139
think maybe I should submit a talk to

133
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,340
Saint Khan this year but you didn't

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,139
has anyone ever considered submitting a

135
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,699
talk to any con

136
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,720
but hasn't

137
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,419
that's imposter syndrome because the

138
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,120
ideas you had the ideas you had to share

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,360
are valid and good and we want to hear

140
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,500
it

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,259
you have experience that you can help

142
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,139
others by sharing what you know

143
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,259
and you are good enough to submit a talk

144
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,460
all right

145
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,039
studies say that 7 out of 10 adults will

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,660
feel imposter syndrome sometime in their

147
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
life and I know in those studies the

148
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,780
other three people were relying because

149
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,220
they wanted it to seem stronger than

150
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,840
they are

151
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,699
so here's a graph for you

152
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,120
47 of humans that get imposter syndrome

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,139
in blue

154
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,539
the green is the other 39 and the

155
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,100
remaining 14 they also get imposter

156
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,460
syndrome

157
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,000
foreign

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,080
if you need to see the details

159
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,039
so how do I know if I feel it

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,139
if you if something goes well in your

161
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,259
life do you think you were lucky

162
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,639
do you think it was the work of someone

163
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,259
else

164
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,120
do you feel that someone else did more

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,900
work than you did it's possible

166
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,259
but do you discredit your own work

167
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,400
and your own contributions

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
are you afraid that someone's going to

169
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,780
pop into the office and say who hired

170
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,520
this person

171
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,979
why are they here they don't know what

172
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,400
they're doing

173
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
are you afraid that someone from your

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
past life is going to going to see you

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
at lunch and say hey what are you doing

176
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
and you say oh I'm I'm working at this

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
company like you do what

178
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,380
you

179
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,020
if you're afraid that's going to happen

180
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,539
you might have imposter syndrome

181
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,639
do you feel like you have to overwork to

182
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,340
meet expectations

183
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,160
this is one that I am so guilty of I

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,979
will pour myself into work trying to

185
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,400
make sure they have no reason to fire me

186
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,919
I work and work and work and I work and

187
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm chasing down every fire and I'm

188
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,460
trying to do every new initiative and

189
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm trying to get more and more out

190
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,460
there so people can see me and it's

191
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,120
because I don't want to be fired

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,180
because if they find out who I am

193
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,319
they're going to fire me

194
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,360
feel Unworthy of attention or affection

195
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,819
this one hits a little close to the

196
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,840
heart

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,039
but there may be some of us here

198
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,099
who in their relationship or they can't

199
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,080
find a relationship because they think

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,240
they are not worthy of love

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
it's not true everyone

202
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,199
is worthy of love and a healthy

203
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,639
relationship

204
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,220
and you need someone to interact with

205
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,620
you are more healthy if you have someone

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,819
to interact with you need love

207
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,220
do you downplay accomplishments if

208
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,220
someone says you did a great job do you

209
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,099
say ah

210
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,300
thanks I didn't do much it wasn't much

211
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,419
if someone says hey let's let's thank so

212
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,039
and so because they did such a great job

213
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,380
at this initiative and they saved us so

214
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,419
much time or so much money or they made

215
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,360
us so much more secure and you say

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,240
it wasn't that much it wasn't

217
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,360
that's imposter syndrome

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,980
do you hold back from reaching

219
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,740
attainable goals do you set a goal for

220
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,580
yourself

221
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,420
and then you might get 80 percent there

222
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,339
and you just and you tell yourself I

223
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,980
just can't do the last 20 percent

224
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm not good enough

225
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,279
does any of this sound true does

226
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,800
anything ring true to anyone

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,180
yeah it's

228
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,760
it's brutal

229
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,120
so how can this show up at work

230
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,720
you might say that wasn't me I didn't do

231
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,019
that much it was him he's better she's

232
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,320
better I'm just me

233
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,300
you won't ask for a promotion

234
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,860
you might get passed over because you

235
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,060
play quiet all the time

236
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,279
you might be stuck in your position and

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,940
you'll get very frustrated

238
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,120
and you'll think I could do more but I

239
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,700
don't deserve it

240
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,260
at home parents every good parent

241
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,260
will feel inadequate they'll feel like

242
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,300
they're making mistakes

243
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,220
sometimes they'll feel like they should

244
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,980
not be apparent

245
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,660
if you've ever heard of a story where

246
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,880
maybe one parent was absent because they

247
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,779
thought they were a bad parent

248
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,260
some cases if the person is

249
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,899
irresponsible in some cases they think

250
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,860
they're a bad parent

251
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,260
we all know bad parents maybe you had

252
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,399
some

253
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,399
if they're doing their best they're good

254
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,860
parents even if they make mistakes right

255
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,959
for you if you are doing your best you

256
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,820
are a good parent even if you make

257
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,240
mistakes

258
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
uh if parents feel they're too much of

259
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,160
imposter they may not they may not feel

260
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,540
comfortable helping their child make

261
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,680
decisions

262
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,600
later in life because they feel they're

263
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,339
not making the best decisions for their

264
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,019
children

265
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,579
at school

266
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,339
students might not speak up they might

267
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,899
not ask questions they want to seem as

268
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,240
clueless as they feel

269
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,980
that's to their detriment

270
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,320
they're not clueless they're students

271
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
and relationships again if if you think

272
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,779
that you are not worthy of love

273
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,500
you might sabotage your relationship

274
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,820
you might end it before they can end it

275
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,300
and that is so frustrating it does not

276
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,880
need to happen

277
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,360
so how can one overcome imposter

278
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,500
syndrome

279
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,420
recognize the facts

280
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,959
one that I often recognize or I have to

281
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,079
recognize I think

282
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,700
that guy would be better in my position

283
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,519
than me she'd be better in my position I

284
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,839
think they should have my job

285
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,640
that might be true they they might have

286
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,980
more experience

287
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,839
now if they have more experience does

288
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,600
that mean you're not valuable

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,839
no it means they have more experience

290
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
they might be getting paid more than you

291
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,500
because they have more experience

292
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,880
that's a fact

293
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,399
they may have there may be someone

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,200
working with you who has experience in

295
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,019
another niche of infosec security than

296
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,360
you do maybe they have more forensic

297
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,620
work or more threat hunting or

298
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,040
uh they have been a manager

299
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,339
so they have more skills that's a fact

300
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,640
they might have more skills than you

301
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,800
they're not you

302
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,220
I have been a manager and I have hired

303
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,839
people and I have seen their

304
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,240
shortcomings I've seen where they lack

305
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,600
skills that they said they had

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,560
and I don't care

307
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,720
I say let's focus your energy on those

308
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,940
skills let's get those going so you

309
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,560
match what you think you are

310
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
because you don't need to feel like an

311
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
imposter

312
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,139
just fill the gaps

313
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,540
you're hired

314
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,180
I'm not going to fire someone

315
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,220
for not having everything they put on

316
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,579
their resume as their as hard as they

317
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,320
can Flex

318
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,579
I'm going to hire someone because I see

319
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,440
their potential and I see their

320
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,940
initiative

321
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,579
and their ability to figure things out

322
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,579
and learn new things yeah I want that

323
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,440
person totally in my team because

324
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,019
they're going to be stepping up

325
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,899
if they feel like an imposter I need to

326
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,510
fix that

327
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,639
[Music]

328
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,360
right like I've seen people write it

329
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,700
like every mid senior yeah

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,820
I would want to see on a resume I have

331
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,260
done this and this and this I have

332
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,240
helped with this and this and this and I

333
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
want to do this and this and this

334
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,139
and then when I'm interviewing them I'll

335
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,079
say okay so you did that

336
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,120
tell me about that you helped with that

337
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
what does that mean and you want to do

338
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,380
this oh you've you've done a little bit

339
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,300
you want to do more of it great I know

340
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,240
beginner entry

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,500
good

342
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,940
make sense

343
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,079
that's what I'd want to see

344
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,740
exactly

345
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,339
and

346
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,459
into what my actual role I'm trying to

347
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,860
try to film and those are the facts

348
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,779
I have when I was younger I put on my

349
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,660
resume everything in the tech stack and

350
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,279
every every initiative that the company

351
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,199
tried to do I was like I was part of

352
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,339
that

353
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,740
I wasn't part of any of that

354
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,139
that was the network guy and the systems

355
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,060
guy I was just the security guy

356
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,880
I responded to alerts

357
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,940
and I felt when I when I came to grips

358
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,399
with the facts I was like oh no I didn't

359
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,260
do those things

360
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,899
and then I was like well

361
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,519
my resume actually I feel very

362
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,800
comfortable with my resume now

363
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,199
because that's exactly what I did and

364
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,699
what I haven't done

365
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,019
so when I go to interview they don't ask

366
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,120
me about those things anymore

367
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,279
nice

368
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,440
separate your feelings from those facts

369
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,959
you are not bad for not having

370
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,060
experience

371
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,399
you are not bad for

372
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,440
recognizing your inexperience you are

373
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,180
bad if you say you have experience and

374
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,540
you don't

375
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,019
if

376
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,620
if you are if you're in a relationship

377
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,000
and you do something that hurts the

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,360
other person

379
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,399
that's going to happen you are going to

380
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,440
hurt the people you love

381
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,660
you are going to be hurt by the people

382
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,160
you love

383
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,440
if you love them and you guys can talk

384
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,500
about it forgive them likewise if you

385
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,680
hurt them own it talk about it and they

386
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
can forgive you

387
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,760
you love each other

388
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
don't defend it and don't hide from it

389
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
and don't pretend like it didn't happen

390
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,880
you deserve to be loved and so do they

391
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,380
take note of your accomplishments if you

392
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,940
have a problem with in with with

393
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,760

don't belong there look at what you did

404
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,600
no one else did it you did it

405
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,060
you're totally qualified to be there and

406
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,800
be participating with your team because

407
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,680
you did that you contributed that much

408
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,300
recognize it own it

409
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,180
share with with people you trust

410
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,279
say I'm trying to overcome my imposter

411
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,619
syndrome and I did this today

412
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,958
and it was good I did a good job

413
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,699
imagine saying that to someone I worked

414
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,319
on this and this and I did it and it was

415
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,839
good and it it contributed to the the

416
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,819
success of the the project

417
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,720
and someone go wow good

418
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,559
how would that feel

419
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,299
talk to others

420
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,820
everyone in this room feels imposter

421
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,880
syndrome everyone out of this room feels

422
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,059
imposter syndrome talk about it

423
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,340
ask how someone else deals with it what

424
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,580
they're afraid of how they feel it

425
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,679
if you talk to the right person they're

426
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,200
going to give you the feedback you need

427
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
you're doing a good job look at you

428
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
you're at St con you're learning you're

429
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,600
sharpening your spear

430
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,360
you're you're doing a great job

431
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,240
preparing yourself for tomorrow

432
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,640
talk to a therapist

433
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,880
I think everyone should have a therapist

434
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,460
I can play a therapist I've had therapy

435
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,320
for over a decade

436
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,140
uh I think everyone should have someone

437
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,240
to talk to so when you trust that you

438
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,220
can share your secrets the things that

439
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,360
you're afraid to tell anyone else

440
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,100
because they're not going to judge you

441
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,740
they're going to try to help you find

442
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,419
the problems where you are not

443
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,580
functioning the way you want to

444
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,160
and they'll help you

445
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
so who didn't feel imposter syndrome but

446
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,000
should have we're going to get to one

447
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,380
more thing on how to deal with plaster

448
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,059
syndrome and I want to use this guy as

449
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,200
an example

450
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,520
can anyone guess who I'm going to say

451
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
you won't but any ideas who who does not

452
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,740
feel imposter syndrome but should

453
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,340
anyone

454
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,980
who

455
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,880
is awesome your boss

456
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,340
I promise you your boss does feel

457
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,020
imposter syndrome

458
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,000
and if you walked in and said you don't

459
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,140
belong here

460
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,059
they'd have to Grapple with that because

461
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,799
they believe it

462
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,580
um

463
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,220
Kanye

464
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,160
maybe I mean Eddie just dropped him

465
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
anyway um

466
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,080
did anyone see this movie or read this

467
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,720
book this is the Martian

468
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,039
okay

469
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,879
what did he do

470
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,640
okay but what was his training

471
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,780
he's a botanist

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,360
he was on Mars if you didn't spoiler

473
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,760
alert you should have seen it by now

474
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,980
he was on Mars part of a mission and

475
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,780
they had a storm coming and was going to

476
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,780
knock over their uh their return ship so

477
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
they had to

478
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,200
abort the mission and run to the ship

479
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,440
and take off so they could go home

480
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,200
and during the storm something impaled

481
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,580
his suit and knocked him out and buried

482
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,960
him in sand and they thought he was dead

483
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
so they left

484
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,220
he was not dead uh he came he woke up

485
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,179
made it back into the to the outfit and

486
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,080
started figuring out how to survive

487
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,360
now the chemist could probably atomize

488
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,459
H2O and not cause an explosion

489
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,200
he didn't know how he knew the concept

490
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,900
and he Jerry rigged it together and he

491
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
made an explosion

492
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,200
and then he fixed it

493
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,820
if

494
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,700
the whole team was there

495
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,500
and the chemist was off doing something

496
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,600
else and they said hey can you go figure

497
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,460
out how to atomize the H2O so we can

498
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,500
grow potatoes

499
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,780
he'd say why am I doing it why wouldn't

500
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,400
he do it

501
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,780
they said oh yeah you're right you'll

502
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,220
probably make an explosion

503
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,260
chemist can you go do it the right way

504
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,539
the first time

505
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,940
right

506
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,039
now the chemist wasn't there

507
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,260
so he did his best

508
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,780
he caused an explosion he didn't die and

509
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,820
then he figured it out and it didn't

510
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,260
phase him at all

511
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,700
because the chemist wasn't there

512
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,460
this is the key to imposter syndrome

513
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,940
stop comparing yourself to other people

514
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,200
stop comparing yourself to other people

515
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,440
their background and their history is

516
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,419
different than yours they're in a

517
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,100
different position than you are they

518
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,260
have different problems than you do they

519
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,059
have different concerns they than you do

520
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,740
they have different fears they have

521
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,179
different priorities they have different

522
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,620
perspective

523
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,260
they are not you it is not fair to

524
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,900
compare yourself to them for any reason

525
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,820
even twins are different enough they

526
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,700
should not be compared to one another

527
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,740
they might be similar but they shouldn't

528
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,179
be compared and they should not compare

529
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,880
themselves to one another

530
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
don't believe anything you see on social

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,919
media from anyone

532
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
no one

533
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,320
is a hundred percent factual and true

534
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,520
on social media

535
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,500
it's a highlight reel it's the best of

536
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,179
the best

537
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,960
people don't say oh my gosh I suck

538
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,340
I

539
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,280
I did not tweet when I shut down email

540
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,799
for a weekend

541
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,740
I feared for my job because I screwed up

542
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,559
so bad I learned don't do your work in a

543
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,299
bubble have someone else check your work

544
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,059
I shut down email for a weekend and the

545
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,039
sales team enough people have come and

546
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,240
gone they don't remember it but for a

547
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,320
long time they're like are you messing

548
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,179
with our email again no you're just not

549
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,059
getting your leads it's not me

550
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,340
I didn't tweet about that I felt

551
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,780
terrible

552
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,059
I tweeted a whole bunch about Jason and

553
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,799
snow and deviant and I tweeted that I'm

554
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,400
doing this talk today

555
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,840
but don't believe anything on social

556
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,799
media

557
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,260
don't look at your peers

558
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,240
they're where they are for their reasons

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,620
and you are where you are for your

560
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,679
reasons you they belong there and you

561
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,539
belong there

562
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,880
you're not better or worse you're just

563
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,900
you and that is perfect

564
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,299
don't look at your superiors they've got

565
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,980
more experience than you do that's why

566
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,419
they're your Superior

567
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,580
if they're a wizard if they're if

568
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,940
they're a freak of nature and they just

569
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,860
breathe if a sec and they're younger

570
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,919
than you and they are your Superior so

571
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,059
what

572
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,940
that doesn't mean you don't belong

573
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,280
you belong just as much as they do your

574
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,799
Superior might be younger than you

575
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,280
okay

576
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,220
don't look at your juniors

577
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,260
if anyone is there younger than you

578
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,419
don't think you're Superior

579
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,580
they're there for a reason and you're

580
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,860
there for a reason on the resume they've

581
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,919
got their I'm good I'm I'm best I'm good

582
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
I'm better

583
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,940
maybe you have more best than they have

584
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,220
better that's great

585
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,299
I promise you both belong you are a

586
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,520
valid

587
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,980
contributor holy cow okay we're almost

588
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,820
done

589
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,039
uh don't imagine that anyone is a rock

590
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,159
star no one is a rock star everyone has

591
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,760
struggled everyone has problems

592
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,500
they they belong where they are and you

593
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,179
belong Where You Are

594
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,440
how

595
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
someone else's success has nothing to do

596
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,299
with you it doesn't take away from you

597
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,799
it doesn't

598
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,440
mean you're any less they can succeed

599
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,780
and you can succeed they can succeed and

600
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,520
you don't succeed

601
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,020
that's okay

602
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,340
there's nothing wrong with that

603
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,960
now before you kill information uh

604
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,480
information security

605
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,020
I wish I wish before you kill imposter

606
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,360
syndrome

607
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,679
you have to congratulate yourself

608
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,039
because

609
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,620
recognizing that you don't think you

610
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,940
belong

611
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,299
says a lot about you it says that you

612
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,280
want to belong

613
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,400
you're afraid of being fired

614
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,980
you're afraid of being exposed as a as a

615
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,280
fraud

616
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,720
you want to be better

617
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,820
feeling imposter syndrome is a good

618
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,520
thing if you can recognize you're

619
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,000
feeling it

620
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,559
pat yourself on the back and then drop

621
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,799
it

622
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,640
I don't need to feel this

623
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,700
it's a real thing and it's only to hurt

624
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,760
me and I don't need it I can let go of

625
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
this because I belong and I am important

626
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,620
and I bring value just as much as anyone

627
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,059
else

628
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,360
and then go and do what only you can go

629
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
and do

630
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,220
okay

631
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,880
any questions

632
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,500
any thoughts

633
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,360
anything you want to vent anyone any you

634
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,719
want to share

635
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,440
what's the best way to help others get

636
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,260
past this especially

637
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,760
when you see that they're struggling

638
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,760
ask them what they've accomplished

639
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,380
tell them you can see the Imposter

640
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,580
syndrome

641
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,100
and they don't need to worry about it

642
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,960
you're not going to expose them as a

643
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,140
fraud you're not going to to recommend

644
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,659
they be let go

645
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,700
you see the Imposter syndrome it doesn't

646
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,460
belong they belong they have value and

647
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,440
talk and ask them get them to say what

648
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,760
they've what they've accomplished and

649
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,360
celebrate that

650
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,980
Institute

651
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,659
I think so many people get negative

652
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,900
feedback

653
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,520
his wife will try to compliment someone

654
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,700
every day and we get we have so much

655
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
negativity we don't get

656
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,679
the pot we don't get the compliments

657
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,900
this is true and something that bugs me

658
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,880
about information security we're trained

659
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,820
to find the problems our brains are

660
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,820
tuned for the problem and the bad thing

661
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,919
and so we need to make a conscious

662
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,679
effort to find positivity and be a

663
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,020
positive resource for others any other

664
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,779
questions or suggestions

665
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,120
say if you hit all people raise their

666
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
hands about the talk I spoke last year

667
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,740
we were speaking this year

668
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm unsure talk to the organizers yeah

669
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,020
they will let you know that something

670
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,460
that they think

671
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,919
I'm sure let them know say hey I think

672
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,539
I've got enough knowledge in this and
