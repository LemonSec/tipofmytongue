22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,680

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
Utah Saint organization before there's

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,699

26

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,080
and I'll explain it to you but this

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,939
conference is made possible by that

32
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,000
incredible organization and a lot of

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,340
dedication of time from a lot of

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,360
different people which we'll talk about

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,740
here in a minute

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,600
I've got just a couple of questions for

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,299
you and the audience what we always like

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,439
to see is how many of you are here

39
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,520
attending St Khan for the very first

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,799
time raise your hands

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,979
there should be about 300 of you which

42
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,680
is incredible

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,720
um and then what I wanted to also ask

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,759
before I moved on is how many of you are

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,939
from outside of the state of Utah now

46
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,560
okay there's a pretty good contingent of

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,380
non-utah folks uh and I would say you

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,000
know not Idaho we kind of adopt the

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Idaho folks in so maybe I should have

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
clarified that but uh we welcome and uh

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,860
you know our conference is growing it's

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,739
kind of crazy when you're when you just

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,180
kind of put this labor of love together

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,040
and it just continues to grow and

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,959
develop and become better and bigger and

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,020
crazier but we've got so many cool

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,120
things planned for this year uh it

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
seemed like the year for covid when we

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
did the virtual thing man that was such

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,900
a letdown for all of us that plan and do

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,060
things and last year was kind of our get

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,520
back to things and and we did the whole

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
in Real Life theme but this year it has

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,739
been taken up another notch in a lot of

65
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,420
different ways but I want to just

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,640
mention that growth is our biggest

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,180
challenge so we have gone from about

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,060
1200 people attending Saint Khan to this

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,000
year over 1500 people are attending

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
Saint con

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,459
um so there's a lot more going on there

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,040
are more communities to explore this

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,140
year than we've ever had before and so

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,280
there's a couple of them up on the

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,720
screen here

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,840
there's more contests to explore you'll

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
also notice here a badge component to

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
this uh this year which we'll talk about

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,340
here in just a moment there are more

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,500
events going on this year than we've had

81
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,360
before

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
um and it's going to be incredible we're

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,220
hoping that you explore some of these

84
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,140
different contests communities and

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,120
events and really enrich your experience

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,860
because if you're just sitting in

87
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,959
ballrooms listening to talks that's

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
great because there's some great content

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
there

90
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,780
because we've got more presenters and

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,220
more content that we've ever had before

92
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,799
but make sure that you don't just live

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
your life in a ballroom

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,060
um and and listening to talks

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,799
unless that's what you came to hear I'm

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,780
not trying to sway you away from you

97
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,239
know what you're here to learn and do

98
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,040
we also have more Keynotes this year

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,260
than we've ever had we're stacking three

100
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,159
in between right now and lunch and so at

101
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,780
the end deviant I don't know if you're

102
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,019
around but you might have an Angry Crowd

103
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,519
uh if it's getting too close to lunch

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,319
but

105
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,720
he says it's going to run long but hey

106
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
it's going to be worth it so more

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,760
Keynotes than ever before and more you

108
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,358
1500 people it's an amazing development

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,519
I don't know how we continue to sustain

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,260
this growth

111
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,639
um

112
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,860
somebody's on comms

113
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,280
sorry

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,020
um what I wanted to maybe just warn you

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,360
all for next year is that when we open

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,940
up registration it is currently our plan

117
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,660
to only sell 1500 tickets to Saint Khan

118
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,820
for the next couple of years part of the

119
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,479
reason for that is we are all volunteers

120
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,240
there's nobody including myself or

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
anybody else that takes a single dime

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,520
for running this event

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,919
um and so with volunteer effort every

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
single person that is a Committee Member

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,020
a staff member or a volunteer are

126
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,780
volunteering their time and energy and

127
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,520
efforts and equipment and everything

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,940
else to make this conference happen and

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,740
so there's a limit to what you can

130
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,020
expect a bunch of volunteers to do and

131
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,759
we feel like we've kind of begun to

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,800
reach it now we might fluctuate these

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
numbers in the future a little bit but I

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,540
just want to kind of let you know

135
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,360
that register early register often next

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,100
for next year but it does it takes an

137
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,780
army and so I do want to recognize that

138
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,240
there's over a hundred people attending

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,620
the conference this year that are in the

140
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,720
volunteer category to help make

141
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,860
everything happen from AV

142
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,180
yeah from AV to the contests the

143
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,100
communities and all of the events and

144
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,320
everything else it takes an army there

145
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
are 40 plus staff members and the

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,460
differentiation between volunteer and

147
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,840
staff is these are the people that are

148
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,000
actually pulling together the content

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,320
these are the people running the

150
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,840
communities running the contests doing

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,639
all that planning then it takes months

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,080
of planning to do some of these things

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,940
and so please give them a hand as well

154
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,560
for their content contribution

155
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,880
and and because we love them so much I

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,699
put these really crazy figures together

157
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,400
uh over the years this is the conference

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
planning committee and I want to just

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,419
really quickly share that planning for

160
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,240
this conference starts in March

161
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,699
and it really starts ramping up as early

162
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,460
as May every single year and so these

163
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,440
are the folks that are spending many

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,819
hours

165
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,340
weekly working on all of the different

166
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,080
things and the planning that and the

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,120
logistics that go into this and so this

168
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,199
is our conference planning committee

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,580
we'll thank them at the closing you

170
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,600
don't have to give them a round of

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,160
applause unless you want to that's cool

172
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
[Applause]

173
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,020
this year we also have more sponsors

174
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,000
than we've ever had before I think we're

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,780
up to 18 or 19 and they're unwieldy too

176
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,660
in a way we'd really love to have

177
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,120
sponsors here and what I the best way of

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,940
articulating this is sponsors are why we

179
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,460
have nice things that's why we can put

180
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,620
up great projection it's why we can have

181
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,840
really cool conference Badges and so we

182
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,699
can have what's that

183
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,160
and it's part of the reason why whenever

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,199
you walk around the conference and you

185
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,639
pick a soda can out of one of those

186
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,440
coolers that you don't have to pay for

187
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
it's part of the reason why that's

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
possible too and so we would like to

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
thank our sponsors for being part of our

190
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,539
committee or part of our planning and

191
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,610
our conference this year thank you

192
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,699
[Applause]

193
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,220
and as you might or might not know we

194
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,400
have an Uber sponsor slot that we only

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,039
award one every single year and this

196
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,060
year Valcom was awarded or elected to be

197
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,160
our Uber sponsor and this is a different

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
level of Engagement they're bringing

199
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,000
different things into the conference

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,039
they it costs them a little bit more

201
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,580
money to come in and provide

202
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,080
that service and and be part of this

203
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,539
community or Community see I'm nervous

204
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,520
I'm stuttering it's okay

205
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,080
um but anyways I would love to welcome

206
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,360

officer at Valcom and we couldn't be

213
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,520
more excited to be this year's Uber

214
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,940
sponsor at saintcon the Saint Khan

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,219
planning committee has put together what

216
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,080
we believe to be an absolutely

217
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,640
outstanding week and we think you're in

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
for a real treat

219
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,080
we're very proud to be associated with

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
saintcon as a company based out of Salt

221
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
Lake City Utah we know that that puts us

222
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,220
around some of the the greatest Minds in

223
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,480
the country and in the industry

224
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,080
looking around the audience this morning

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,420
I see a lot of friendly faces but I know

226
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,459
not everybody is exactly familiar with

227
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,519
Falcom but even though or some of you

228
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,800
may be familiar with us you may not know

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,779
that we're actually the largest IT

230
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,120
solution provider based out of Salt Lake

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,760
City Utah out of this great state and uh

232
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
part of that's because we've been around

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,959
a long time we actually have a a big

234
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,019
milestone coming up next year we turn 40

235
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,420
years old and we've actually got some

236
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,800
really exciting stuff planned for next

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,540
year and we look forward to celebrating

238
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,459
that with many of you

239
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,500
but uh we have some really great

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,060
Keynotes coming up I don't want to get

241
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,440
in the way I do just want to mention a

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,779
couple of things about Valcom and it

243
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,880
really starts with

244
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,100
um cyber security is really important to

245
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,779
us

246
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,940
it's important to our economy it's

247
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,279
important to our state and it's critical

248
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,880
to our future everything we do we do a

249
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,940
cyber security in mind

250
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,959
it's also really complex

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
this is just an example of some of our

252
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,100
key Partnerships in cyber security

253
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,660
I actually spent a little bit of time

254
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,880
last week trying to find out just how

255
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
many companies in the world actually

256
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,080
have a cyber security offering or a

257
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,240
product and couldn't come up with that

258
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,260
number

259
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,420
it's because cyber security is moving at

260
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,220
light speed it's just really hard to

261
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,720
keep your your arms around everything

262
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,279
that's out there right now

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,580
but we can help navigate this we have an

264
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,040
awesome team of cyber Security Experts

265
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,760
that work hand in hand with our clients

266
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,320
they do this

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,140
by truly understanding the desired

268
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,260
outcome of our clients right so what are

269
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,240
the specific results or the expected

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,720
results from the Business Leaders and

271
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,420
the I.T leaders of the organization

272
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,880
we place our clients at the center of

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,640
our cyber security practice ecosystem

274
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,519
so that's the the tools the resources

275
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,700
the services the Partnerships and the

276
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,820
people all aligned to deliver that one

277
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,160
single outcome

278
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,279
and then lastly just keep it simple

279
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,579
reality is cyber security is a race

280
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,040
to stay one step ahead of those Bad

281
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,720
actors

282
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,839
this is a tremendous task you're not in

283
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,480
it alone we have great people

284
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,519
we can help you get it done right and

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,519

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,019

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,180

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,180
down and explore there's uh sponsorship

299
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,240
booths uh please visit them it makes it

300
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,660
makes life easier for everybody uh if we

301
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,160
understand what Solutions are available

302
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
valcom's got plenty of great Solutions

303
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
there's also some other vendors down

304
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,480
there worth visiting as well I want to

305
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
transition to just a couple of

306
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
housekeeping items before we jump right

307
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,760
into Keynotes I want to talk just

308
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,320
briefly about the same com badge that

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,519
cool thing you've got around your neck

310
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,279
yes it is an electronic badge yes there

311
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,680
should be a battery in the bag that it

312
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
came with that you put it in there to

313
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,339
turn it on we did pre-populate two of

314
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,720
them for you we figured you could

315
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,339
probably figure out the Third on your

316
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,380
own

317
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,459
uh because we didn't want them to

318
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,140
somehow get turned on accidentally and

319
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,180
drain the batteries and things one thing

320
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,100
to mention about the badge this year is

321
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,399
that the badge is a contest okay there

322
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,920
is a contest component to it as you can

323
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
kind of tell it it's reminiscent of

324
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,660
maybe something you've played before uh

325
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,760
maybe like a clue game

326
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,579
kind of thing what we're going to do is

327
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,079
we're going to open up that badge

328
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,600
contest starting at one o'clock this

329
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
afternoon and so you get to go explore

330
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,220
and start figuring out

331
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,800
and get a clue that's really what it

332
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
comes down to so that's all I'm going to

333
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,579
say for right now there is other than

334
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,339
there is a badge support Booth

335
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,800
downstairs in our Expo space that you

336
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,420
can go ask questions or if the badge

337
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,100
isn't working quite right or whatever it

338
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,160
is that you want to ask there the the

339
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
place to go and ask that this year and

340
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,300
we really appreciate the MK Factor folks

341
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,260
Mike and Katie for Designing running and

342
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,040
doing all this

343
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,180
yeah as I was kind of mentioning before

344
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,100
it takes months of planning and things

345
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,620
other than myself and I don't say that

346
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,139
to be conceited or anything at all Mike

347
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,019
and Katie put in the most time building

348
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,540
that badge and doing what it is to get

349
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,920
that thing around your necks and so we

350
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,440
really do appreciate them next thing I

351
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,060
wanted to just mention if you have not

352
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,700
joined the saint Khan Discord server

353
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
this is where all of the back of Channel

354
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,500
communication happens this is where our

355
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,800
community lives uh and interacts not

356
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,779
just during the conference but all year

357
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,300
long and so there's a vibrant great

358
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,820
community of of Security Professionals

359
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,980
I.T professionals and others that hang

360
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,500
out in that Forum please join and

361
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,380
especially during the conference

362
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,459
interacting in that forum is probably

363
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,399
going to enrich your experience

364
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,899
um I also want to just mention that the

365
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,639
Expo doors downstairs even though we

366
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
might be done closer or around noon or

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,540
noon 30 ish uh inside of our keynote

368
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,000
session the keynote or sorry the Expo

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
space will not open until at least one

370
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,320
o'clock today we hope that you would

371
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,820
respect that and don't try and find your

372
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,980
way in there the reason for that is we

373
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,839
feel like the volunteers and the staff

374
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,399
members should also be able to eat

375
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,100
before they have to deal with 1500

376
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,959
people coming in and want to get all in

377
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,000
all those interesting things and so

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,560
please just hang out we've got a couple

379
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
of other things going on in the hallways

380
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,060
to keep you distracted or interested uh

381
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,800
while we're allowing some of those folks

382
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,560
to do to do that speaking of food

383
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,260
food is part of Saint Khan for many of

384
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,420
you we actually had to cut off our Foods

385
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,060
ticket sales

386
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,980
because there's a certain level at which

387
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,500
the venue can reasonably do and so some

388
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,240
of you don't have these really cool food

389
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,260
stamps or food stamps Food tickets

390
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,079
wow Blast from the Past sorry

391
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,120
um if you don't there are there's a

392
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,620
Vibrant Community of restaurants and

393
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,240
other things in the local vicinity that

394
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,000
you can go out and get food and other

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,560
things we also have an hour and a half

396
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,120
break for lunch and so it gives you

397
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,399
ample time to go out there and come back

398
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,519
and still not miss a whole lot such

399
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,459
sodas and snacks when you do see sodas

400
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,000
around or snacks appear on a table those

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
are free for all I mean well sort of

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,120
like don't just take 20 or anything else

403
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,160
when you don't need them but that's what

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
they're for is we're providing you

405
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,279
snacks that's not part of the food plan

406
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,380
I want to just let you know that soda is

407
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,139
free at St con please don't stock up to

408
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,760
take back to your hotel room and do an

409
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,160
all-night Mountain Dew rush or something

410
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,680
because it does cost us money and we do

411
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,779
try and control those costs but it has

412
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,699
been a tradition at Saint Khan or the

413
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,820
Utah Saint conference for a long time to

414
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,100
have a free flow of soda but what you'll

415
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,380
also find this year is several options

416
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,959
of low or no sugar

417
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,099
so there you go

418
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,899
last thing I wanted to mention I kind of

419
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,579
mentioned it for badges but all other

420
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,000
contests hackers challenge uh and and so

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
on start at approximately one o'clock if

422
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,600
you don't get into that Expo space until

423
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,279
one o'clock you're not missing out on

424
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,380
anything uh some might start a little

425
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,360
bit later but as a general rule most

426
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,860
contests are starting after one o'clock

427
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,959
last thing of housekeeping really

428
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,300
quickly is I wanted to actually give a

429
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
little bit of extra recognition to both

430
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,680
Saint Khan or sorry yeah for Saint con

431
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,440
two to Cisco excuse me

432
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,680
um they have donated uh as part of their

433
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
sponsorship with us a lot of the network

434
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,339
infrastructure that we're using to

435
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,579
provide Wireless in the entire venue and

436
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,859
we also want to thank centracom for just

437
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,020
casually saying the other day hey you

438
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,579
know what that one gig link that we've

439
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,020
had in there for you guys for a long

440
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,400
time

441
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,020
where you want to just make it a 10 gig

442
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,500
link and so you got 10 gig of Uplink in

443
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,240

and so here's what I'm going to do I'm

447
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,520
going to start here transitioning over

448
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,500
into our Keynotes

449
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,480

450
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,100
do this other than I'm going to walk off

451

452
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,900
slide and say now to the Keynotes we are

453
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,000
so thrilled to have them here but I am

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,380
not going to introduce them I'm going to

455
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,539
let somebody who's way better at

456
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,440
introducing them introduce them
