I'm Sean Groth I'm with something called

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,939
the sizza anybody ever heard of sizza

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,099
I don't have any dragon pants on today

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,740
but I'll I'll try to channel the

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,839
director as much as I can she's awesome

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,880
our director Jenny Shirley so that's the

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,500
cyber security and infrastructure

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,740
Security Agency but I'm not going to say

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,180
that again I'm just going to say cizza

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,160
because that's a lot to say so I'm the

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,019
regional director for Region 8 includes

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
Six States including Utah and I'm going

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,800
to talk to you a little bit about our

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,440
agency just kind of where we came from

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,000
where we are a little bit about the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,280
threat landscape I've only got 30

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,500
minutes this afternoon after lunch

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
somebody much better looking and smarter

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,579
than me Rick Gardner one of our cyber

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,440
security advisors is going to talk for

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,899
an hour about all the free stuff that

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,520
you can get from us a lot of free

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
services that we provide they're kind of

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,780
prepaid if I don't know if anybody here

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,059
pays taxes but that pays my salary which

26
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,879
means it's a prepaid service but a lot

27
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,940
of really good stuff that we uh that we

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,220
provide where's my little clicker and I

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,619
wish anybody do Peloton I feel like a

30
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,600
Peloton instructor picture with this

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,220
thing they got the little

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,560
I didn't get my ride in this morning all

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,420
right so a little bit about scissors so

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,400
we were kind of born we're really one of

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
the newest federal agencies we're part

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,820
of the Department of Homeland Security

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,700
but we were born out of an organization

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,880
that was stood up back really in 2003

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
2004 when the department set up looking

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,600
at critical infrastructure where

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,799
something called infrastructure

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,020
protection and and back then we were

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,820
just really looking at terrorists flying

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,500
planes into buildings again or blowing

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,360
up critical infrastructure really The

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,759
Kinetic Physical threat but as the years

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,799
progressed and we started you know

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,140
continued to visit infrastructure sites

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,259
they started talking about passwords and

50
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,299
OT systems and I.T systems and the

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,579
threat really started to to change over

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,740
the years and cyber became a big thing

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,540
when I first started doing this nobody

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,820
talked cyber so we had to we had to

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,159
change and morph all of those things we

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
used to do on the physical side the

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,719
assessments the training the exercises

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,580
those things we still do those we never

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,199
let those go because that threat is

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,879
still out there so a little bit

61
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,580
different now more so from internal

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,680
domestic violent extremists and

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,180
criminals less so from the international

64
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,060
folks so that's still there but we now

65
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,220
have this the the overlaid Cyber threat

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,440
that we're very concerned about but we

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,239
we talk about leading the national

68
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,340
effort to understand and reduce risk to

69
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,200
the critical infrastructure both cyber

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,959
and physical and really a lot of that is

71
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,879
just connecting stakeholders in

72
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,280
government in Industry across the

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,620
country with resources capabilities each

74
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,500
other information intelligence all of

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,480
those kind of things if you look over

76
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,980
there on the

77
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,660
I guess it's the left side of the screen

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,879
for you you see how we kind of break

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,560
down infrastructure so we have we break

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,780
it down into 16 different sectors it's

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,519
just a way to categorize and organize

82
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,400
sort of at the national level what we do

83
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,780
um you can see our mission and vision

84
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,700
there I think that would be very very

85
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,580
clear to all of you I so just to get a

86
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,920
host uh idea of the audience private

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,239
sector folks

88
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,680
raise your hand

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,860
awesome love you uh Federal any federal

90
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,260
folks sit in the back please just

91
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,180
kidding just kidding State local

92
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,319
government

93
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,120
all right all right good good cross

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,300
sector of folks uh appreciate that

95
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,640
um our priorities I think you know

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,860
hopefully uh these should these should

97
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,060
ring true with you critical

98
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,560
infrastructure security and resilience

99
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,659
that's kind of very broad again that's

100
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,360
that's our foundation is looking at the

101
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
the security of uh of critical

102
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,019
infrastructure industrial Control

103
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,239
Systems focused really on cyber security

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,239
we do a lot of work with ICS systems we

105
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,640
have training programs around that that

106
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,799
Rick might be able to hit uh later on

107
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,019
today uh that you would probably be

108
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,440
interested in soft target security

109
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,720
um when we first started looking at

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,940
infrastructure we looked at really you

111
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,900
know things like water and

112
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,519
Communications and transportation the

113
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,159
hard infrastructure but as the threat

114
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,019
changed and people started going to

115
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,879
malls and shooting people and schools

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,459
and houses of worship and open-air

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,920
venues we really had to change as well

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079
that became a sector of critical

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,600
infrastructure for us so we go to houses

120
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,399
of worship we go to schools we do

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
physical security assessments there we

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,139
go to large events think uh Cheyenne

123
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,759
Frontier Days anybody know what Cheyenne

124
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,740
Frontier Days is that is awesome if

125
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,940
you've never been there it's pretty

126
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,240
awesome but we work with soft targets as

127
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,060
well climate resilience impacts of

128
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,580
climate change extreme weather on

129
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,960
critical infrastructure very important

130
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,180
out here in the west with the drought

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,340
and the extreme weather fire wildfires

132
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,560
we look at those things in terms of

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
federal cyber security we have

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,479
authorities over the federal.gov network

135
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,639
so that's the really in the executive

136
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,680
branch of the federal government and

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,780
then and when it comes to large-scale

138
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,639
incidents at the federal level we lead

139
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,560
What's called the asset response so

140
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
there was something very boring that you

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
might think is boring called ppd41

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,259
talked about how the federal government

143
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,060
would respond to incidents and we got

144
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,580
the responsibility to focus on the asset

145
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,400
FBI does law enforcement OD and I does

146
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,080
the intelligence aspect but we're

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,660
focused on the actual asset and then

148
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,360
Partnerships we can't do any of this

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
alone so I've got three people now in

150
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
the entire state of Utah to work for

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,380
cyber security for sizza it's a pretty

152
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,360
big state for three people so one of

153
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Rick's primary jobs is to work with all

154
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,979
of you partner with you provide you our

155
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,259
resources get information back from you

156
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,479
you know all that sharing so one of the

157
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,860
I think one of the unique things about

158
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,539
sizza is our Reliance on those

159
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,340
Partnerships working with private sector

160
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,919
and all levels of government and it's

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,840
fun it's probably one of the most fun

162
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,580
places to work in the federal government

163
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,740
just a little bit about that I mentioned

164
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,840
region eight so you know where where I'm

165
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,580
based in Lakewood Colorado that's just

166
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,100
west of Denver I've got a regional staff

167
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,960
there but I have people in all six of

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,060
those States kind of a similar lay down

169
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,340
I've got cyber security advisors if you

170
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,960
do physically looking for physical

171
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,220
security I have physical security

172
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,780
advisors I have chemical security

173
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,580
inspectors and people who work

174
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
Communications emergency communications

175
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,840
so if you're in any one of those areas

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
you you may be uh may be interested in

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,220
connecting

178
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,840
Services I'm just going to hit this

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,580
briefly because I want you to come back

180
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,880
at 1 30 and listen listen to Rick talk

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
about in detail about the assessments

182
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,139
and other things we provide but

183
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,479
vulnerability assessments again physical

184
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,940
and cyber uh cyber security advisors

185
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,800
they'll come in they'll take a look at

186
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,419
your facility they'll analyze the

187
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
potential threats vulnerabilities talk

188
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,600
you through some of your security

189
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
measures security plans you know you

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,979
could be very immature to very mature

191
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,979
and we've got a capability uh to to do

192
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,180
those that's kind of the bread and

193
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,400
butter of of what our security advisors

194
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,460
do we also offer a lot of exercises and

195
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,960
a lot of training

196
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,819
um we do a lot of them virtually so we

197
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,520
do I think four or five webinars every

198
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,440
month uh that are open to anybody

199
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,720
whether it's uh you know we've done

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,180
Insider threat we've done active shooter

201
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,880
we do uh You Name It We we've done it

202
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,800
any one of our our pieces and you can

203
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
get signed up you'll have contact

204
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,220
information here you can get signed up

205
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,139
for any of those things I mentioned

206
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,360
Outreach and information sharing

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,919
um so we do again we do a lot of

208
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,740
Outreach events like this

209
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,060
webinars I mentioned

210
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,039
um conferences and then the information

211
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,460
sharing piece connecting you to various

212
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,440
pieces of information if you're on our

213
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,419
distribution list for sizza you get a

214
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,880
ton of stuff from us we send out a lot

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
of stuff and we're working through how

216
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,039
to improve that process but you know you

217
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
might have gotten three four emails just

218
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,860
this morning on different things that

219
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,300
are happening it's really important I

220
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,940
think if you're in this business to be

221
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,800
on our distribution list to get them we

222
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
put out known vulnerabilities we're not

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,539
focused on one type of system or asset

224
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,699
we're looking across the entire industry

225
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,620
and really trying to inform you on the

226
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,720
most critical things that are happening

227
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,660
um every day unfortunately

228
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,520
direct technical assistance that's just

229
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,620
like it sounds incident support

230
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,419
operations so if you're familiar with

231
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,580
the National Response Framework we do

232
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,380
what's called emergency support function

233
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,360
two at the federal level which is

234
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,879
Communications and 14 which is the

235
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
cross-sector business and infrastructure

236
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,560
so again bringing the private sector and

237
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
critical infrastructure into a national

238
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
or Regional incident incident response

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,059
and then special events I mentioned

240
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,520
things like Cheyenne Frontier Days but

241
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,760
we also support things like the

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
presidential inauguration or conventions

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,740
Super Bowls we send people out before

244
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,420
the Super Bowls after during the Super

245
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,640
Bowls do security assessments both on

246
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
the physical and cyber side and

247
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
communication so really there's no uh

248
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,580
there's no problem that we're not

249
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,500
interested in or sector that we're not

250
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,180
interested in I want Rick to stand up

251
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,580
real quick just in case you have too

252
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,380
much launch and can't come back Rick is

253
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,120
my cyber security advisor here in the

254
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,700
great state of Utah and come visit him

255
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,260
if you're not going to come back at 1 30

256
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,320
he will he will be able to connect you

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,640
with what you need

258
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,680
all right so put this in here so that

259
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
you have uh have the contact information

260
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,740
on my team Andre Mouton got an extra s

261
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,140
in his email address if you're really

262
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,180
paying attention you saw that I don't

263
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,680
know it's not supposed to be there so

264
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,959
just ignore it and then here's some

265
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,120
additional contact information okay

266
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
cyber threat landscape none of this is

267
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,959
going to be I hope a big surprise to you

268
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,959
I just want to

269
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
take a drink and then I want to tell you

270
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,779
about you know so we put out this

271
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,019
Shields up message before Russia invaded

272
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,660
Ukraine I think anybody remember looking

273
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,399
at our Shields up we're like

274
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,820
seriously folks get your Shields up

275
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,459
we haven't seen a lot of the attacks

276
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,440
that we thought we might see

277
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,420
that doesn't mean the threat's not still

278
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,779
there it's not still as significant if

279
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,160
you've seen what's been going on in

280
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,980
Russia and Ukraine Russia's not having a

281
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,540
great deal of success that they thought

282
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,580
they were going to have so you might

283
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,500
think that they might get more desperate

284
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,940
right so we don't know what the future

285
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,920
may hold with uh with Russia and what

286
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,300
they may try to do in the United States

287
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,459
but obviously we're still concerned

288
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,019
about the potential for them to launch

289
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,000
cyber attacks into the United States

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,100
both from their state-sponsored assets

291
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,839
and then cyber criminal groups that are

292
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,899
aligned with Russia you've seen the

293
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,399
increase in ransomware attacks they're

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
getting more destructive uh they're

295
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,019
getting more prevalent I got hit up

296
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,660
about you know attacks on the federal

297
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,820
government and I said it's it's not just

298
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,920
the federal government everybody from

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
Mom and Pop shops all the way up to

300
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
Fortune 100 companies are getting

301
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
attacked on a regular basis so we all

302
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,820
need to have our Shields up and it all

303
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,120
starts with you know with the individual

304
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,380
we know that other nation-state addition

305
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,500
series are investing significantly in

306
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,720
their cyber offensive capabilities and

307
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,079
defensive capabilities hacking tools I

308
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,700
mean any of one of you I'm sure could

309
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
get online and and very easily find

310
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,160
ransomware as a service anybody with

311
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,500
basic capabilities can get on and buy

312
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,720
their own ransomware so they're just

313
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,779
becoming more prevalent more easy to use

314
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,940
we're working as I mentioned across the

315
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,440
federal government state local

316
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
governments to try to address this that

317
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
threat but again it's that collaboration

318
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,820
it's that information sharing so it's

319
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,560
very different you know from the

320
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
physical aspects of threats that an

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,959
incident or a Cyber attack that happens

322
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,540
at a small mom and chop mom and pop

323
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,820
water facility could have National

324
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,980
consequences because of the threat actor

325
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,560
and and because of the vector and

326
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,940
because of the malware that's being used

327
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,220
right so that may be a test and it's

328
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,779
very quickly going to spread across the

329
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,579
country to something more significant so

330
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,079
we want to know about those things and

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,820
I'm going to give you an email address

332
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,040
that uh that we want you to report those

333
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,200
things to and we may not come back to

334
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,579
you and say hey thanks for your report

335
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,260
great here's what we're doing with it

336
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,000
because we get a lot of them but know

337
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,160
that the big donkey later back in

338
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,959
Washington DC were assessing we're

339
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,640
analyzing we're trying to make a

340
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,079
determination of whether or not that's

341
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,820
something that the federal government

342
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,860
needs to be getting involved in and then

343
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,959
get information out to all of you in the

344
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,099
community to take action

345
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,560
this is hard turning pages and flipping

346
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,779
slides and everything else why can't you

347
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,360
flip my slides for me I mean what no

348
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,700
just kidding Rick all right so I want to

349
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,959
talk a little bit about some of the

350
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,060
things that we're offering that are kind

351
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,459
of new uh to help out one of them is the

352
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,680
cyber security grant program for State

353
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
local tribal territorial governments

354
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
first of its kind just came out we just

355
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,220
came out with a notice of funding

356
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,480
opportunity

357
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,000
I guess a month ago two months ago it's

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
closing in November but state

359
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,620
governments can apply for cyber security

360
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,740
grants similar it's run similar to the

361
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,180
way the FEMA grants are run if you're

362
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,620
familiar with that there's an

363
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,200
application process

364
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,660
that is open and closes on November 15th

365
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,760
so if you're part of state government or

366
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,320
local government hopefully you've heard

367
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,959
of this if you haven't again reach out

368
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,060
to me reach out to Rick we'll get you

369
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,220
connected get you as much information as

370
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,660
you can but you can Google cyber

371
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,220
security grant program and find a lot of

372
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,560
stuff first year we're really looking at

373
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,540
basic capabilities getting folks to

374
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,000
establish a cyber security plan do some

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
assessments get a really good Baseline

376
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,019
and there's going to be three more years

377
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,480
following this of uh of funding from the

378
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,820
federal government for cyber security uh

379
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,800
I think it's 80 percent Rick has to go

380
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,260
to local governments which is really

381
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,639
great because we know there's a

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
significant deficit and resource

383
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,540
capabilities that the local governments

384
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,839
think County think City and so they need

385
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,100
it they need the support and help

386
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,540
the other thing cyber security awareness

387
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,060
month so I know most of you are cyber

388
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,279
Security Professionals in here or or

389
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,380
hackers or just people really interested

390
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,600
but cyber security awareness month is

391
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,880
every October I think it's one of my

392
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
notes saying 19 years now we've been

393
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,420
doing this thing and it's really to

394
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,700
raise cyber security awareness across

395
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,860
the country there's an awesome tool kit

396
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,100
on there for your awareness programs for

397
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,620
your training programs we we put out you

398
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,019
know these basic slides you can a lot of

399
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,339
good resources on cyber security

400
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,500
awareness month this year it's called

401
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,540
see yourself in cyber what we really

402
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,420
want to do is to bring cyber all the way

403
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,220
to the individual level cyber security

404
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,380
practices right so you're all

405
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,820
practitioners your professionals you

406
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,500
know not to click on that email you know

407
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,880
to update your software you know all

408
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
that stuff but we want Grandma and

409
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,660
Grandpa to know the same thing and we're

410
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,339
kind of relying on all of you in this

411
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,040
room to help us with that because really

412
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,880
I think they said 90 percent of of uh

413
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,680
rants war attacks start with a phishing

414
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
email whether they're successful or not

415
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
I don't know if that's a the statistic

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,019
is right we get new ones all the time

417
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,300
but that's you know Grandma and Grandpa

418
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,120
sitting at the computer or you know your

419
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,820
least trained employee sitting at the

420
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,139
computer going yeah that looks right let

421
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,540
me click on that so this month this this

422
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,180
month is all about everyone being able

423
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,459
to see themselves in cyber and promote

424
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,560
cyber security it really this is one

425
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,180
where it really takes a village right it

426
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,519
really takes the the entire nation I'm

427
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,899
going to talk a little bit about some of

428
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,540
the action steps the basic action steps

429
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,139
we're asking you to promote at the end

430
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,420
here I mentioned that report a cyber

431
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,699
issue deal this is very easy sizza.gov

432
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,500
report opens up a little email thing and

433
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,800
you can report your cyber incidents

434
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,560
or just call Rick anytime day or night

435
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
on the weekend

436
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,079
we won't even give them overtime

437
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,639
and this is the cyber security awareness

438
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,380
website you so you'll have that to click

439
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,740
on again a ton of resources shouldn't be

440
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,240
any malware on that site but I'm not

441
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,339
guaranteeing that but um go ahead and

442
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,199
click on that link and it'll get you to

443
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,420
some free resources

444
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,180
action steps so these are pretty

445
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,579
straightforward but these are the four

446
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,620
things that we think that if you promote

447
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,800
to every individual across the country

448
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,740
will be much more secure as a nation so

449
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,260
multi-factor authentication you know you

450
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,760
can don't you don't have to even say

451
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,040
that word just say hey Ma when they ask

452
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,899
you if you want a text message you got

453
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,000
to do that got to do that thing I got

454
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
nailed on Facebook a couple of weeks ago

455
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
with that and the text message thing

456
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,399
somebody got my Facebook I hate Facebook

457
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,339
I know but I got the suit thing on I

458
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,920
know I use Facebook I'm an old guy okay

459
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,620
tease me all right uh strong passwords

460
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,079
that you know complex it's amazing how

461
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,060
how often we find that people are still

462
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,279
using the the password password I'm sure

463
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,019
you could anybody else catch anybody

464
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,060
recently with password123 is the

465
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,899
password

466
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,880
yeah when we first started doing the the

467
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,120
critical infrastructure stuff the the OT

468
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,060
systems people would still use capital P

469
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,119
the one it came with right didn't change

470
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,579
it for years anyway strong passwords

471
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,459
recognize and Report uh phishing and

472
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,559
then updating your software I have a

473
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,059
little mnemonic I'll share with you it's

474
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,520
not approved by sizza but I'll share it

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,780
with you because this isn't being

476
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,299
recorded it's just being live streamed

477
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,919
which is different

478
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,819
um

479
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,640
right nobody would require I I say make

480
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,919
strong attacks fail badly

481
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,980
make strong attacks feel bad make

482
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,620
multi-factor authentication does anybody

483
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,179
think this is cool or not come on give

484
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,039
me I don't have a vampire costume on It

485
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,380
come on make I'm making stuff up here

486
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,600
probably gonna get fired make strong

487
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,340
attacks feel badly multi-factor

488
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,000
authentication strong passwords strong

489
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,460
attacks antivirus so that's not in there

490
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,720
but I I needed a an a antivirus fail

491
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,220
with a pH

492
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,320
fail right

493
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
badly backup that's also not in there

494
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
but update your software is close enough

495
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,919
make strong attacks feel better good yes

496
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,960
good thank you all right that's awesome

497

you're very kind you just want to go to

499
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,840

500
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,580
um okay so that's thank you no I'm

501
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,440
supposed to go to questions and answer

502
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
there's contact information

503
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,179
so it was great speaking with you all

504
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,640
this morning remember that right after

505
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
lunch our cyber security advisor I

506
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,539
already told you Rick's going to be here

507
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,700
he's going to have a ton of stuff for

508
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,280
you a ton of opportunities to uh to

509
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,600
partner partner with each other and

510
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
partner with us what questions you can't

511
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,140
leave yet where are you going

512
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,220
yeah

513
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,160
any questions for me

514
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,720
got to be one

515
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
sir

516
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,520
I could not hear that question at all I

517
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,980
apologize how did you say how do we see

518
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,419
it changing or developing

519
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:09,660
well what I have seen so I've been I've

520
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,340
been part of the department since I left

521
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,580
the Army in 2003

522
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,740
I think what I have seen is a

523
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,120
significant Improvement in the

524
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,520
information sharing piece and not just

525
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,039
in the federal government

526
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,740
but across the industry we're partnering

527
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,280
with um with companies you know the big

528
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
the big tech companies like we never did

529
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
before

530
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,919
um so I see that as a significant

531
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,580
Improvement but I also see things like

532
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,700
the the malware being available free on

533
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,340
on the web for any idiot to sorry

534
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,039
any individual to download and and

535
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,679
utilize and and that's just going to

536
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,580
continue

537
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,919
tying sort of the cyber security piece

538
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,720
to the overall threat picture that we're

539
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,799
looking with misinformation

540
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,360
disinformation

541
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,660
I just see a proliferation of of again

542
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,120
uh Bad actors continuing to use our own

543
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,880
freedoms against us on the web on our

544
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,220
social media platforms

545
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,380
um and doing things like uh you know the

546
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,299
big fakes those kind of things so yeah I

547
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,820
mean it's it's it's unfortunately going

548
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,340
to continue to go this way uh but I see

549
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,140
that our our are sharing our

550
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,059
communication the things we're providing

551
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,679
is going to increase as well I don't

552
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,419
hopefully that kind of helps sir

553
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,700
you mentioned that you're interested in

554
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,020
making law areas you're not interested

555
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,080
Define critical

556
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,240
yeah so the um

557
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,620
the definition of critical

558
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,900
infrastructure is in something uh called

559
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,340
the national infrastructure protection

560
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,039
plan and it's really defined as those

561
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,020
assets and systems so vital to the

562
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,720
United States that their destruction or

563
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,559
incapacity would impact our way of life

564
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,780
so that's all the really big stuff one

565
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,419
of the challenges we have again if you

566
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,179
think of the the Cyber threat versus the

567
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,679
kinetic threat is

568
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,179
that may not be a critical

569
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,160
infrastructure but that's a critical

570
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,179
attack

571
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,580
right so that's a critical Vector that

572
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,620
is a critical piece of malware that now

573
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,780
I need to be very interested in

574
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,280
the other piece that I think we weren't

575
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,880
thinking about in 2003-2004 is the way

576
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,860
of life part

577
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,660
I have little kids that go to elementary

578
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,760
and Junior High School and I pray every

579
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,679
morning when I take them to school that

580
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,720
they're not going to get hurt and I

581
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,159
don't mean like fall off the playground

582
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
anybody with kids we never had to think

583
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,179
about that to me that's way of life

584
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,400
that's now critical infrastructure and

585
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,380
so the challenge for us is

586
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,140
you know what's not critical we do

587
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,000
prioritize

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,080
um you know those Lifeline

589
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,460
infrastructure especially on the

590
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,679
physical assessment side we prioritize

591
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,240
those that are going to impact the most

592
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,820
people but we we essentially have to

593
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,799
kind of look at all of the things that

594
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,299
are going to impact our way of life go

595
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,480
ahead

596
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,260
you already paid for it every year by

597
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,220
April 21st

598
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,140
appreciate that

599
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,260
yeah no charge no charge but I will tell

600
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,419
you that we have some things that are

601
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,000
have a significant backlog in terms of

602
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,919
requests that require maybe National

603
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,200
level assets to come and then we have

604
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
other things we have lots of self-serve

605
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,520
capability

606
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
self-assessments and quick assessments

607
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,419
so and that's where the human being can

608
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,700
help you sort of determine you know

609
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,320
where you fit into that picture and how

610
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,260
we can get you on those services

611
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,700
I thought there was another one in the

612
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,140
middle

613
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,700
no

614
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,860
way back there oh this can be hard to

615
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,399
hear I'm

616
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,320
whichever one is attacking us right now

617
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,299
they're they're all I mean I you know I

618
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,080
I think it's very been very we the odni

619
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
puts out a threat as a national threat

620
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
assessment every year this last one and

621
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,340
it's unclassified like anybody can read

622
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,440
it this last one had so much information

623
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,600
I was shocked we would have we would

624
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,299
have classified that in 2004 like TS SCI

625
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,000
with 48 different caveats it's totally

626
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
unclassified and they really do a good

627
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,860
job of walking through the capabilities

628
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,960
and intent of the nation-state actors

629
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,000
and they do it from the from sort of the

630
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,740
kinetic National Level side and the

631
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,900
Cyber side so I would encourage you to

632
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,120
look at to look at that

633
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
because that'll give you more detail

634
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,120
about where we think each one of them

635
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
are

636
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,960
way back there I see the arm I don't see

637
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,320
the face

638
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,120
I'm not allowed to have in a personal

639
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,199
opinion but go ahead

640
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,640
I'll

641
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,918
foreign

642
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,419
yeah so elections falls under the

643
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,100
government facility sector it's a

644
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,559
sub-sector under under that which is why

645
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
you don't see it up there

646
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,820
um yeah we work with the elections

647
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,159
offices very closely they have you know

648
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,539
they Avail themselves of a lot of our

649
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,220
resources

650
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,140
um in terms of recommendations for you

651
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,960
working with them now if if you if you

652
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,340
don't already have a relationship right

653
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,020
now is kind of a bad time to reach out

654
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,260
because they're busy but after after the

655
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,179
election is over and and things have

656
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,940
been tabulated and argued about I mean

657
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,100
it's just making that connection

658
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,919
um assessing what their needs might be

659
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,659
and whatever you have in terms of

660
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,400
sharing information I mean elections

661
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,020
again are the Cornerstone of our

662
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,600
democracy and and uh you know we all

663
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,360
have a have a role to play in that so

664
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,740
um that that would be my initial

665
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,200
recommendation to you

666
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,980
yes sir

667
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,100
I don't have the authority to cancel

668
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,900
your federal contract sir

669
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,740
our assessments are voluntary uh and we

670
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,860
are we on on the Cyber side with what

671
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,840
Rick does we're not a regulatory agency

672
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
we have a small regulatory function

673
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,419
within sizza it's related to the this

674
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,159
the physical security of chemical

675
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,320
chemicals

676
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,940
um but yeah we're not a regulatory

677
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,760
agency from that perspective and we

678
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,500
provide you options for consideration

679
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
which one might be have your guys wear

680
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,320
their badge might be a good idea so yeah

681
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,419
we're not gonna I'm not planning to

682
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,220
cancel any of your stuff

683
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,919
so yes sir oh I'm sorry I didn't you

684
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,260
have to wait okay you in the back that

685
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,820
was waving

686
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,200
okay you sir

687
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,380
I wouldn't know I don't I'm not involved

688
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,360
in uh cyber offensive operations that's

689
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,340
a different uh part of the government

690
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,980
so I wouldn't be able to provide a

691
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,340
a good assessment of that I could guess

692
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,000
what's that

693
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,059
compared to other nation states I mean I

694
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,500
don't I don't I'm not really willing to

695
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,279
make a comparison

696
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,840
anybody else

697
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,020
um I think I would answer that to say I

698
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,820
think our power grid is pretty resilient

699
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,860
and we've seen that based on a lot of

700
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,020
natural disasters not even you know

701
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,000
considering cyber attacks

702
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,620
um with the multiple different grids we

703
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
have

704
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,860
um so I think it's just a much different

705
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,799
situation in terms of the physical grid

706
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,740
than they have in Ukraine

707
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,659
and I think I have time for one more

708
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,340
question and then everybody's going to

709
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,539
lunch

710
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,220
I know I answered two years so if

711
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,720
there's nobody else now okay you get it

712
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,860
you get you get the last one

713
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
um

714
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,460
I think that we're in the same position

715
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,559
a lot of companies are in in terms of

716
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,260
hiring cyber professionals there's a you

717
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,640
know significant

718
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,120
Gap in the number of cyber uh cyber in

719
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,399
the Cyber Workforce and so we Face the

720
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,539
same issues

721
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,360
um we've we've just gotten a new

722
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,360
um a new hiring system for hybrid hiring

723
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,279
cyber professionals called the Cyber

724
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,380
talent management system which sort of

725
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,860
opens up our ability and flexibility

726
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,940
within the federal government it's still

727
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
not as flexible as industry so

728
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,440
um you know you might say we're

729
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,960
competing uh but I think

730
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,240
a lot I think most of my cyber security

731
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,220
advisors could probably leave tomorrow

732
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,159
for a significant increase in pay

733
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,460
but the the mission is so important and

734
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,899
and a lot of them are you know

735
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,520
ex-military

736
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,279
Etc and they really believe in wrapping

737
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,600
themselves in the American flag and

738
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,279
protecting the country I mean that's why

739
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,659
I've been doing this as long as I have

740
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,679
so

741
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,020
yeah okay well thanks everybody for

742
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,880
hanging in appreciate it

743
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,979
[Applause]
