1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
good morning everyone welcome to Saint

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,220
con day two

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,099
yes three people are excited to be here

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,139
um I'm Doug Hubbard welcome to my

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,940
presentation why

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,099
why data breaches aren't like plane

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,020
crashes but should be I'm an information

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,820
security engineer at the company route

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,920
we're a software company

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,660
um we've got an app that's that's really

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,580
all you need to know about that

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,480
um

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,279
speaking to my employer brief disclaimer

14
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,380
the words that I'm saying here are mine

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,480
not my employers just always got to get

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,679
that out of the way

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,880
all right on October 29 2018

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
a Boeing 737 Max departed from Jakarta

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,260
on a routine domestic flight in

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,700
Indonesia

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
shortly after takeoff the pilots

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,520
struggled to maintain control of the

23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
plane as the nose continually pitched

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
downward and after what must have been

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,680
an excruciating few minutes eventually

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,559
they crashed into the Java sea all 189

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,760
people on board were killed

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
unfortunately the flight only lasted 13

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,199
minutes

30
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,180
that's actual foot picture of the

31
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,760
wreckage a few a few months later on

32
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,600
March 10 2019 a second Boeing 737 Max

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,420
ran into a similar issue Ethiopian

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,540
Airlines flight number 302 left Nairobi

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,700
Kenya and the pilot immediately had the

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,439
same issue where the nose kept pitching

37
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,020
downward he lost control as well and

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,000
after several minutes of struggling the

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,460
plane crashed killing 157 people on

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,400
board six minutes into its flight now

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
the two crashes made international news

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,659
it was a big deal most likely somewhere

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,799
in the backs of your minds you remember

44
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,159
hearing about this the Boeing 737 is a

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,600
very venerable airplane that's been

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,299
flying since 1967.

47
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,659
and has serviced many many flights it's

48
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,220
very reliable and well respected so how

49
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,799
do these two plane crashes happen the

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
reaction was very Swift from regulatory

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
bodies from Airline manufacturers

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,159
airline companies International

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,960
governments and law enforcement agencies

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,460
so people from all these different

55
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,320
groups all these different places got

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,600
together cross-discipline shared notes

57
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,939
and investigated to figure out what

58
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,280
happened how did these two planes crash

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,340
in the same way just months apart within

60
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,739
days of the second accident the global

61
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,340
Fleet of 737 Maxes were grounded and not

62
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,560
a single plane would fly for more than a

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,780
year and a half Boeing estimated that

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,819
the loss of their groundings was 18

65
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,860
billion dollars

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,200
so what happened well the investigation

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,780
revealed after exhausted review that it

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,760
was a combination of poor training

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,940
software errors dangerous marketing and

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,780
mechanical failures so the 737 Max was a

71
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,700
new version of the 737 the biggest

72
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,260
difference was that the engine was

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
larger and this made it more fuel

74
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,220
efficient and cheaper to operate their

75
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,019
big selling point is that they said this

76
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,580
is the exact same plane just with a

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,140
different engine you don't need to have

78
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,879
exhaustive new training you don't need

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
to have totally new parts just go ahead

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
and add it into your Fleet and keep

81
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
operating

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
the problem was that's not entirely true

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,700
there was some there were some

84
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,319
differences the primary difference that

85
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,940
we're going to talk about is because of

86
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,040
the change in the engine size there was

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,900
some change in aerodynamics and that

88
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,019
made it so during takeoff occasionally

89
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,340
the front of the plane would actually

90
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,700
pitch its nose up and risk a dangerous

91
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,099
stall rather than trying to correct the

92
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,319
aerodynamics of the problem they decided

93
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,060
to solve it with software

94
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,620
they put a sensor in the front of the

95
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,480
plane that would measure what they call

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
the angle of attack if the plane ever

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,640
started to pitch up too high then

98
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,500
automatically without the pilot

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
necessarily knowing the rear tail would

100
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,959
activate and cause the nose to come back

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
down and what had happened in both of

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
these crashes is that that sensor had

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,220
malfunctioned and the plane was rising

104
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,680
at a safe rate but the software detected

105
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,959
that it was going too high and it forced

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,060
the nose to pitch down and you can look

107
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,040
at the the flight trajectory the plane

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,080
is it goes up and down a whole bunch of

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,239
times the Ethiopian Airline Pilot

110
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,799
actually recognized what was happening

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,019
and deactivated this software but by

112
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,879
then it was too late

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,760
so what happened well before any of

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,799
these planes could fly again they had to

115
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,360
apply some things first they had to do a

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,120
hotfix they changed the software they

117
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,280
also improved the diagnostic lights in

118
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,858
the cockpit changed the UI

119
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,019
increase the training on the crew they'd

120
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,180
found that some Pilots of the 737 Max

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,639
had only had two hours of training on an

122
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,680
iPad prior to Flying it in addition to

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
their normal training and they also

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,400
added the ability to override the

125
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
software very quickly so in other words

126
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,160
the airlines improved their Technologies

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,080
processes and training when operating

128
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,540
this aircraft and what's remarkable is

129
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,639
that it wasn't just one company that did

130
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,100
this but it was every operator of the

131
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,620
737 Max in the world had to apply these

132
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,139
changes before they could fly again

133
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,080
those two plane crashes were a tragedy

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,880
and it's awful that those people lost

135
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
their lives

136
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,240
but all of these changes happened as a

137
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,100
result and it serves as a warning for

138
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,800
future aircraft design so in a very real

139
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,259
way the world is there the airline

140
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,020
industry is safer because of these two

141
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,220
accidents and that's just how the

142
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
airlines operate when a crash happens

143
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,540
it's a big deal there's lots of people

144
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,040
who investigate there's lots of

145
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,440
cooperation and a lot of transparency

146
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,419
the fact that I can tell you all about

147
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,759
this even though I'm not in the airline

148
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,560
industry that we can go down to the

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,600
second in many cases in plane crashes to

150
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,820
describe what happened shows how open

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,400
they are about sharing this information

152
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,860
and as a result of doing this over the

153
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,440
course of more than 100 Years of flying

154
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,020
flying in an airline is extremely safe

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,600
the odds of an American getting into a

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,820
plane crash in any given year is one in

157
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,919
11 million

158
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,660
for comparison the odds of you getting

159
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,220
struck by lightning sometime in your

160
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,199
life are one in three thousand

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,820
but we didn't arrive at this overnight

162
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,740
it happened gradually over the course of

163
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,280
many years and this safety record in a

164
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,080
very real sense is paid for by the blood

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,900
of the people who came before us

166
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
so let's compare that with the

167
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,660
information security in the tech sector

168
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,820
right what would happen if the airlines

169
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,940
treated plane crashes like we treat data

170
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,460
breaches so here's a here's a fictional

171
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Airline notification right

172
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,139
we regret to inform you that seven

173
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,300
months ago between March 10th and 23rd

174
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,460
we suffered a safety incident

175
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
between 100 and 300 people may have been

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,360
impacted many of those may have suffered

177
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,520
minor bruises an unknown number may have

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,919
suffered loss of life or limb we've

179
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,539
hired expert Consultants to figure out

180
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,919
what went wrong and how to prevent

181
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,100
future incidents in coming months those

182
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,900
impacted will be contacted above and

183
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,460
beyond what is required by law and

184
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,259
receive credit monitoring and most

185
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,699
importantly

186
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,340
your safety is important to us

187
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,139
now what actually happened in this

188
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,539
incident on March 17th the plane

189
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,860
suffered an engine malfunctioning

190
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,440
crashed all 212 passengers and crew were

191
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,340
killed

192
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,639
right so this is this is a very

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,880
different way of looking at how to

194
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,460
respond to to issues so why are we

195
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,840
talking about this well obviously this

196
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
is a security conference and even though

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,160
the airline industry and the security

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,139
industry are very very different I think

199
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,580
there are lessons that we can learn from

200
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,139
it

201
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,240
data breaches are all around us and

202
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,860
happening at what seems to be an

203
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,319
increasing rate and every data breach is

204
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,840
a lesson for everybody else in the

205
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
industry

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,139
in a perfect world every data breach

207
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,539
would have open transparency around what

208
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,880
happened what do the attackers do what

209
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,960
did they get away with how are people

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,000
impacted and how can we stop it from

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,620
happening now there's a lot of reasons

212
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,080
why we don't have that happen right and

213
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,419
I'm not saying that everything needs to

214
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,060
be totally open every time but if we did

215
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,599
have that happen we'd live in a world

216
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,099
where you never have the same data

217
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,259
breach twice where once an attacker

218
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,639
figured out a way to get into a company

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
everybody else would stop it and they

220
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
wouldn't be able to come back in now the

221
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,479
risk tolerance for airline travel is

222
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,740
very different than the risk tolerance

223
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,840
for working in the software industry or

224
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,060
working in technology right your data

225
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,800
date of birth being exposed is far

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
different than risking a grisly death

227
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,720
but we can try and do things to make

228
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,620
things better we can promote

229
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,479
transparency we can hold vendors

230
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,280
accountable for the mistakes that put

231
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
their customers at risk

232
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,180
and I think we should that's a great

233
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,220
conversation but many of the people in

234
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,599
this room are not going to be the actual

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,099
decision makers to put that into

236
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,199
practice so I want to talk about what

237
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
can you do individually

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,380
how you can be a better security

239
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,559
professional because of this

240
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,120
what can you do

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,159
you can learn from other people's dumb

242
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,620
mistakes so every data breach is a case

243
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,600
study in what not to do and in some

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
cases what to do after a breach

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,060
experience is the is the best teacher

246
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,399
but that experience is very hard earned

247
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,620
nobody wants to get that phone call that

248
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,500
says hey it happened but somebody who's

249
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,180
gone through a data breach is going to

250
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,800
be way better not just at preventing

251
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
breaches

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,980
but better responding to an incident

253
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,100
understanding how to handle PR

254
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,240
understanding how do you work with

255
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,980
regular Regulators how do you

256
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,839
communicate with the different entities

257
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,700
in your company and how do you manage

258
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,860
the messaging all of these things are

259
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,420
things that we can look at that happen

260
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,820
to actual companies and try and learn

261
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,560
from their mistakes

262
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,820
when I first started getting into

263
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,120
security I was I was in in college and I

264
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,220
only think I had one security class and

265
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,360
I said you know this is pretty cool I

266
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,459
think this is what I wanted to do but I

267
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,440
knew I needed to do more so I decided to

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,420
read security news and every day I would

269
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,459
just read a couple of articles about

270
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,200
security news and if something came up

271
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,600
that I didn't understand I go Google the

272
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,519
term or look it up or look at what what

273
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,180
these OAS top 10 things are and try to

274
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,920
understand them and it only took me

275
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,480
about six months before I started to

276
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,700
feel like I I was understanding or

277
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,279
becoming security literate I knew I'd

278
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,080
started to get it when I started to feel

279
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,180
that warm blanket of cynicism just

280
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,560
wrapped me up when I started to hear

281
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,959
about a data breach

282
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,899
so that's the principle let's learn from

283
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,760
other people's breaches let's learn from

284
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,620
those mistakes and I'm going to talk a

285
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,640
little bit of how we can do that with

286
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,839
some examples so I'm going to go through

287
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,640
two examples about some data breaches

288
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
breaches that have happened in the last

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
month or two and then what are the

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
lessons we can tease through them

291
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
because sometimes we've got limited

292
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,500
information and how do we pick that

293
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,740
through so the first one is a is a big

294
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,260
case September 15th this year Uber

295
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,360
suffered a data breach everybody in here

296
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,580
probably is familiar with it does anyone

297
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,899
here not understand what happened with

298
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,300
Uber it's okay if you raise your hand

299
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,459
all right just we'll all be really brief

300
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,820
then um so September 15th Uber suffered

301
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,080
a breach from somebody who's believed to

302
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,880
be related to the lapsis hacking group

303
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,640
lapsis is a group of predominantly

304
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
um teenagers based in the United Kingdom

305
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,120
they've been very successful at

306
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,500
breaching a large number of brands

307
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,940
starting at the end of last year and

308
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,800
working through this year

309
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,320
um what's interesting about them is

310
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320
they're in it for attention I think so

311
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
they like to publicize what they do

312
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,200
which makes it great when you're trying

313
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,420
to research what happened so he breached

314
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,640
Uber on September 15th bragged about it

315
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,019
in a lot of different places he even

316
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,519
answered questions from journalists

317
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,620
about how he did it he posted pictures

318
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,839
online and thankfully

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,180
um some people at Uber also were so

320
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,500
caught off guard that many of their

321
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,420
employees also posted pictures of on

322
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,940
Twitter to to kind of corroborate what

323
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,620
happened so I'm going to go through what

324
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,660
allegedly happened this is based largely

325
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,880
on what the attacker said himself but it

326
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
seems to be a consistent picture from

327
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,899
from the different sources so basic

328
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,339
basic idea you guys know what happened

329
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,640
he he fished the contractor he got the

330
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,620
credentials tried to log in into a VPN

331
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,540
the VPN required multi-factor

332
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,279
authentication but it was a push notice

333
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,420
on the phone the keynote speaker

334
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,399
yesterday mentioned this and he just

335
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,800
started hammering it said hey I want to

336
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,420
log in I want to log in the contractor

337
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,040
kept getting little notices on the phone

338
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
is this you never clicked on it well it

339
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,420
wasn't working so he contacted the

340
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,760
contractor via WhatsApp said hey I'm

341
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,880
Uber it we're having a bit of a problem

342
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,560
with our multi-factor authentication if

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,300
you want this to go by you just have to

344
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,160
click accept once and then you'll stop

345
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,680
getting the notices and that's true

346
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,240
um

347
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,660
he he clicked it and uh the attacker got

348
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,980
into the VPN

349
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,959
once he was there he looked around it

350
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,720
didn't take him long he found a a file

351
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,700
share that contained a Powershell script

352
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,680
and that Powershell script had

353
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,260
hard-coded credentials in it admin

354
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,000
credentials to their privileged access

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,279
management system or their Pam now for

356
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,300
those of you who don't know what that is

357
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,820
that's essentially like a software

358
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,620
manager or a password manager so think

359
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,839
of this as being like LastPass or

360
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
Dashlane or keepass or any of these

361
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,420
other ones

362
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,399
um so once he got in there he got admin

363
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,680
passwords to essentially all of Uber's

364
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
important SAS applications and um yeah

365
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,200
game over after that so what did he get

366
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,480
access to well he got access to source

367
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,660
code he got act he got AWS and gcp admin

368
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,880
at least to some accounts G Suite admin

369
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,680
domain admin vsphere admin Financial

370
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,260
dashboard Sentinel one he also got onto

371
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,940
their slack and he started to make posts

372
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,459
to the company and he said attention I

373
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,079
am a hacker I have breached your network

374
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,120
and then he provided updates on all the

375
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,139
different things that he was doing

376
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,660
people were so surprised by it that they

377
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,920
thought it was a joke and started post

378
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,779
hosting SpongeBob SquarePants memes

379
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,660
thinking ah you guys are so funny I.T

380
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,120
and security did not think it was funny

381
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,700
um and they told everybody to log off of

382
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,380
slack I don't know how they were

383
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,700
thinking that was really going to help

384
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,079
but that's they didn't have any better

385
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,480
ideas and um this is these are the

386
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
screenshots that make it onto Twitter

387
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,560
these these slack conversations from

388
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,019
um from Uber employees and my personal

389
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,120
favorite is the hacker actually went so

390
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,639
far as to breaching their hacker One

391
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,399
account and then posted a notice Uber

392
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,600
has been hacked

393
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,779
and the hacker One account has been also

394
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,940
this is the attacker who made it

395
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,380
um there's been a lot of commentary on

396
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,360
this and I couldn't resist sharing this

397
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,459
is my favorite I found this uh Chris

398
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,260
Powell on LinkedIn said Uber's threat

399
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,060
intelligence is amazing they had the

400
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,620
attacker on their own slack providing

401
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,000
minute by minute attack updates

402
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,800
which is true

403
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,540
all right so this was bad this was

404
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,459
really bad Uber could take a decade to

405
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,959
recover from this they're only saving

406
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,880
grace is that this guy was trying to

407
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,860
publicize what he did so at least they

408
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,139
know what happened when it happened but

409
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,600
in this case Uber is our teacher it's

410
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,980
fun to poke at them hopefully there's

411
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,139
nobody here at Uber that I'm offending

412
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,200
but uh you guys know what you got

413
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
um

414
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,040
so let's learn now Uber didn't do

415
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
everything wrong they did some things

416
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,339
right but but let's learn from their

417
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,779
lessons so here's a couple of things

418
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,699
that we can take from it

419
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:42,779
um

420
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,959
one hard-coded credentials are dangerous

421
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,180
yeah no kidding

422
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,279
um so make sure we don't put hard-coded

423
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,839
credentials in source code we don't put

424
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,940
credentials in in places where people

425
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,339
are going to find it uh limit access to

426
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,019
sensitive information nine times out of

427
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,519
ten when there is a data breach it's

428
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,380
because somebody wasn't following the

429
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,480
principle of least privilege right this

430
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,699
contractor had access to this Powershell

431
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,800
script now even if you concede that this

432
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,980
script exists how many people should

433
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,779
have access to a script that has

434
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,360
privileged access to your password

435
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,320
manager right like very very small like

436
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,440
maybe two three something like that now

437
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,060
again I'm making guesses here right so

438
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,019
I'm not

439
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,279
I'm not going to say this is

440
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,600
definitively what should have happened

441
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
or what did happen but when you're

442
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,120
reading through these lessons you kind

443
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,860
of have to tease things apart and make

444
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,480
some assumptions and it's okay I'm not

445
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,339
testifying before Congress this is not a

446
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,019
criminal investigation we're just trying

447
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,079
to learn so my guess is that if if they

448
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,940
did have carefully restricted access to

449
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,339
this Powershell script what are the odds

450
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,320
that this teenager in the UK was able to

451
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,120
get just happened to get the person who

452
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,100
had access to this I think that's

453
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,019
probably not what happened so I think

454
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,880
that Powershell script was probably much

455
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,560
much more widely available than it

456
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,540
should have been right so that's a

457
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,980
that's an important thing know what your

458
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,440
valuable assets are and prevent broad

459
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,660
access to them um ensure contractors

460
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,579
have security training that contractor

461
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,199
was victim to social engineering so when

462
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,360
you hire contractors make sure you

463
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,980
understand what training they're getting

464
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,199
put it in your contract who's providing

465
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,579
the training is it you is it the

466
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,380
Contracting agency how are we going to

467
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,180
keep track of all this stay on top of

468
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,560
all of it

469
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,360
um and last today's Frontier identity is

470
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,459
is identity and access management it's

471
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,560
not firewalls that are keeping people

472
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,820
out of our Network and out of our

473
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,920
customers data SAS applications have our

474
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
customers data right that's the way the

475
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,760
modern modern software is built and how

476
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,220
a lot of it agencies run so making sure

477
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,779
that you're carefully keeping track of

478
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,000
those usernames and passwords is

479
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,980
Paramount to keeping your customers data

480
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,440
safe right so that's that's just an

481
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,360
example of a case study that you can go

482
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,519
through and learn and pick these apart

483
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,959
now you guys aren't making any of these

484
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,699
mistakes right your companies are all

485
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,519
good right

486
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,060
um

487
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,639
so let's talk about another breach and I

488
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,980
like to do this one a small one to show

489
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,899
that we can learn just as much from

490
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,000
small cases as we can from big ones so

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,280
the city of Detroit had an issue just a

492
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,140
couple of months ago they launched a new

493
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,660
retirement website where you could log

494
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,220
into any employee of the city of Detroit

495
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,859
could log in and manage their 401K

496
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,799
retirement contributions all that and a

497
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,079
man logged into it

498
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
shortly after launch and he found all

499
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,099
these links on the side they said lists

500
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,660
and he started clicking around trying to

501
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,100
figure it out and wouldn't you know one

502
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,480
of them happened to be a spreadsheet

503
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,160
that contained the names birth dates and

504
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
Social Security numbers of his

505
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
co-workers well that wasn't right so he

506
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,100
could have just contacted their assist

507
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,840
admin and worked through it and maybe he

508
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
did but he also contacted Fox News so

509
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
Fox News a local affiliate in Detroit

510
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,020
ran an article about it which is how I

511
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,080
know about it and investigated a little

512
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,600
bit into what happened now the city of

513
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Detroit apologized they said yeah we

514
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,840
understand this was a mistake you did

515
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,580
still need to be an employee to log in

516
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,500
right so it's not like it's totally

517
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,760
exposed

518
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,799
but they then hired a firm to come and

519
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,480
investigate the alleged data breach and

520
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,640
wouldn't you know it they said

521
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,440
we've confirmed this is a problem but

522
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,020
only one person illegitimately viewed

523
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,299
that data who just happens to be the

524
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,860
person who reported it to the newspaper

525
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,140
he looked at 68 different people those

526
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,480
68 people will get credit monitoring no

527
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,700
harm no foul will move on

528
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,660
um

529
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,160
so what can we pick apart from this

530
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
lesson so first off

531
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
broken access controls which is what we

532
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,400
have here illegitimately accessing data

533
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,539
that your users should not have access

534
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,220
to is number one in the oauth top ten

535
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,600
any amount of testing would have found

536
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,640
this right so there should have been

537
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
some security testing somebody should

538
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,179
have looked at this so make sure that

539
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,280
you have security testing in place when

540
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
you're running software and that you're

541
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,059
checking for broken access controls

542
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,740
probably some assumptions were made look

543
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,780
this is internal it's only city

544
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,520
employees but yeah they're still having

545
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,820
a problem and um I love picking apart my

546
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,320
favorite part isn't always the technical

547
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,299
aspects it's the pr nightmare that comes

548
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,500
afterwards when people make poor

549
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,780
decisions on what they say so so what

550
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,660
are the odds that like really only one

551
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,179
person clicked on information that was

552
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,340
available to everybody right you kind of

553
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,039
have to read between the lines a lot of

554
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,539
times they'll say things like no

555
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,580
evidence exists that shows that more

556
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,559
than this data was accessed

557
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,020
typically when you see that I always

558
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,059
think in my head that just means they

559
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,980
don't have logging enabled like that

560
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,260
seems the more logical explanation in

561
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,700
how they don't have evidence is they

562
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
didn't log any evidence so uh

563
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,380
insufficient security metrics and

564
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,480
logging is also in the OAS top 10 as

565
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,500
well so that's something you should pay

566
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,820
attention to because if you do have a

567
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,260
data breach that can change your

568
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,179
conversation from saying we had one

569
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,620
person get breached and we're confident

570
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,600
that it was only one to possibly a

571
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,679
million we don't know how many people

572
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,960
were impacted

573
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,520
so that's what I'm talking about now how

574
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,840
do we get these stories whenever I bring

575
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
this up people always ask me yeah but

576
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
people don't like to report on it they

577
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,700
don't like to talk about what happened

578
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,679
how do we know and it's really not that

579
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,940
hard

580
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,100
um here's a couple of places I like to

581
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,720
look leave this slide up for a minute

582
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
it's in order that I find most important

583
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,860
where should you start industry reports

584
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,660
Verizon and IBM do an annual report

585
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,100
every year where they survey companies

586
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,840
who suffer data breaches then they

587
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,660
aggregate anonymize that data now that

588
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,220
information is

589
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,660
um not going to tell you how they got

590
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,460
hacked but it's going to tell you what

591
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,500
the most common things are and how much

592
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,240
it costs so do you know what the average

593
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,980
cost of a data breach for a company your

594
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,960
size and Industry is because you should

595
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,240
because that's how you get budget

596
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,900
um

597
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,760
so read those Google news is the best

598
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,679
for me that I found just type in data

599
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,059
breach you can set a filter saying the

600
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,740
last six months or whatever you'll learn

601
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,840
really quickly some some articles just

602
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,520
don't tell you much like if I see

603
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,260
anything about health care finances I'm

604
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,820
not going to read it because hospitals

605
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,900
won't tell you anything they just say

606
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,000
yeah we had ransomware

607
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,160
um Twitter is surprisingly good so love

608
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,140
or hate Twitter a carefully curated

609
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,179
Twitter feed will tell you about

610
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,860
security incidents before they become

611
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,559
mainstream news right so maybe create a

612
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,820
second Twitter account that's just for

613
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,520
consuming and just follow some Security

614
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,860
Professionals how do you find them well

615
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,419
you could just type in data breach in

616
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,679
the search and just see who's making

617
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,039
pithy comments about security and uh

618
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,660
breaches and stuff and follow them and

619
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,460
then look at who they follow and follow

620
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,919
them or come to a conference like this

621
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
and if you like the speaker get their

622
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,740
Twitter handle if they post at the end

623
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,820
of the slide deck and see who they

624
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,520
follow again great to consume stuff a

625
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,200
couple of tech and news sites that I

626
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,120
love uh Krebs on security he's a

627
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,320
journalist who investigates security

628
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,660
things great at investigating but he's

629
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,640
not an engineer so just know that when

630
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,980
you're reading it but he does some great

631
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,539
work in uncovering and connecting the

632
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,580
dots between people you know who are

633
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,320
these attackers and he loves to

634
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,900
specialize in spam uh card skimming and

635
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,200
things like that the register.co.uk

636
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,940
Fantastic resource they are Tech news

637
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,520
but they do a lot on security since they

638
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,080
are based in the UK they focus more on

639
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,880
the European stuff but they're very

640
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
cheeky

641
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
um they've got quite a few clever

642
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,919
articles if I ever read about something

643
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,620
in like CNN or or the big mainstream

644
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,559
media that talks about hey here's a data

645
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,760
breach that happened they never tell you

646
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,900
why because that's not what Their

647
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,580
audience cares about hop on over to the

648
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,720
register they'll probably have a

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,000
write-up about it oh and last one I'm

650
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,460
going to mention Equifax the Equifax

651
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,440
data breach is just one breach but it's

652
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,480
probably the most published and

653
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
documented data breach in human history

654
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,880
um Congress brought them up and they

655
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,080
testified before the different

656
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
committees and all that it's all written

657
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
up it's like 80 pages but

658
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
um I think only 20 of them are about

659
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,460
what actually happened and it's

660
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,559
surprisingly accessible so if you're

661
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,480
having problems with management taking

662
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,860
responsibilities for accepting

663
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,659
vulnerabilities show them that report

664
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,740
because that's what they're going to

665
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,720
talk about in there

666
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,620
the last thing is I think that

667
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,960
using stories is a great way to teach

668
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,059
others a good percentage of our time as

669
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,100
Security Professionals is not just

670
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,559
securing systems but teaching others how

671
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,659
to be safe and there's something in our

672
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,419
DNA about learning from stories right

673
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,520
that's why the fables have lasted so

674
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,500
many generations and it's so much easier

675
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,539
to tell somebody hey here's a data

676
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,580
breach that happened with some major

677
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,080
online retailer and here's how we're

678
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,299
making that same mistake and that

679
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,919
conversation is a lot easier than well

680
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,840
theoretically what if attackers did this

681
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,539
than this than this than this

682
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,460
um one way that I've tried to do this is

683
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,080
I've created a presentation at the last

684
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,400
two places that I've worked they've both

685
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,679
been software companies called

686
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,480
who got hacked I've been doing it for

687
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,520
about two years so once a month we get

688
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,200
together all of engineering is invited

689
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,900
and um we'll we'll just talk about the

690
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,580
news we'll say okay

691
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,039
here's four or five stories about who

692
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,020
got hacked in the last month what

693
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,539
happened what did they do wrong

694
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,460
and how do we stand up are we making the

695
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,320
same mistakes or do we have controls in

696
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,220
place that are going to prevent that

697
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,600
from happening and a lot of times

698
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
Engineers don't know we may have the

699
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,299
controls but they don't know that

700
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,620
they're there and it's been awesome

701
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,080
we've had a great time we normally have

702
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,200
around 15 to 30 people show up and to

703
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
think about that it's essentially secure

704
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,980
developer training and we've got people

705
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,840
voluntarily showing up like how hard is

706
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
it to get them to do one hour a year but

707
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,980
we got people showing up every month to

708
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,600
do it on their own and they love it they

709
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,220
love to talk about it

710
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,940
um

711
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,620
and uh

712
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,539
one thing that I always try and do is

713
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,159
your meetings have to be fun if they're

714
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,299
boring no one's ever going to come back

715
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,440
right so I've done tons of stuff I've

716
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,179
written security poetry I've written

717
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,000
songs we've told stories we've held uh

718
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,559
um oh I told stories with puppets once

719
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,539
that was great we did trivia contests

720
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,400
with gift cards

721
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
um companies only ever get hacked for

722
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,400
like six or seven reasons so we made

723
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Bingo cards and every time we go oh this

724
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,659
company got this and we had prizes

725
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,220
um YouTube videos we played video games

726
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,559
here's uh here's our family feud day we

727
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,020
did it on on Zoom I've got this

728
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,140
fantastic gold sequin vest that I found

729
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,820
um and we we did prizes and it was all

730
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,559
set up one time we talked about Facebook

731
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,679
and I did a a um I told everybody I

732
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,059
interviewed somebody at Facebook and I

733
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,039
was going to play the the recording to

734
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
talk in detail about what happened at

735
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
Facebook and here's a screenshot from

736
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,620
that recording

737
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,140
it was it was pretty good Zuckerberg had

738
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,299
a lot to say that day

739
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,860
um just recorded my own mouth and stuck

740
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,840
it on top of it so anyway that's that's

741
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,120
what I'd like you guys to do when you're

742
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,620
thinking about your professional career

743
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,780
or key takeaways here

744
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,360
read up on current events learn from

745
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,860
every hack you hear about so that you

746
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,780
don't do the same thing wrong and use it

747
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,280
to teach others now I want to make sure

748
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,220
that I follow my same principles here

749
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,140
that I want to make this meeting not

750
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,080
boring so

751
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
to try and follow

752
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,100
some of the uh

753
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,720
some of the same things that I did my

754
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,100
other meetings I'm going to read to you

755
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,960
so I'm not that great of a musician

756
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,900
right hopefully we get this mic to work

757
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,520
out with everything here

758
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,200
um

759
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,820
but I'm going to read you this is one of

760
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,260
the things that I did it's a little I

761
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,460
don't know what you'd call it a poem an

762
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,260
intro to tell our people of our company

763
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,080
what what are my uh my presentation was

764
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,720
going to be

765
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,360
you guys hear that

766
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,000
keeping data safe is hard to do there

767
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,700
will always be bad people who are clever

768
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,820
dedicated and try hard to defraud steal

769
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,400
and bypass our guard stay safe from the

770
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,220
bad guys why not learn from those who

771
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,860
are less wise you can read about them in

772
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,860
the news about the CEOs and managers

773
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,559
whose failed policies processes and

774
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,840
tools have led to lawsuits best

775
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,179
practices and rules that we can discuss

776
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,360
analyze and use so sit back but stay on

777
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
track

778
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,460
as we talk about

779
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,820
who got hacked

780
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,000
thank you

781
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,820
um I'm going to give him a few minutes

782
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,140
to turn over for the next presenter but

783
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
if you've got questions we want to talk

784
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,520
I'll be up here
