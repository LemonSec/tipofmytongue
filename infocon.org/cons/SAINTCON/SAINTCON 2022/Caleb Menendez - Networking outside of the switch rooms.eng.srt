1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,500
but I'm going to be talking today about

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,659
networking outside of the switch rooms

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,819
so I'm not talking about like networking

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,799
in your home or cables I'm talking more

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,019
about communicating with people and and

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,700
why it's important

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,860
so a little bit about myself my name is

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,320
Caleb Menendez I'm a proud father a

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,840
helpful husband passionate gamer and

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,140
overall nerd I included a picture of my

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,119
time at fanx here because that was

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,279
another convention that I love but I'm

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,960
also currently a security analyst for

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,660
Fox pest control and I kind of run their

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,180
entire security team there and then I

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,260
have a master's in management

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,760
information systems from USU

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,360
and so

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,219
when I was thinking of this I I want to

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,960
know why why Network what's the point

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
why is it beneficial to us why is this

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,860
something that you guys came to listen

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,539
to what's useful to you

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,120
and I think a lot of I.T gets a bad

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,860
reputation for being introverted

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,680
especially within the security world we

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,980
we tend to have the outside view us as

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,539
introverts that kind of stick to

29
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,739
themselves

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,500
and networking itself also gets a really

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,840
bad reputation for only being about

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,080
getting jobs or for opportunity and so I

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
kind of want to break out of those two

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,960
and I found three reasons to network

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
so those three reasons are to maintain

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,900
sanity

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,240
for utility and then for opportunity

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
so maintaining sanity I was thinking

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,320
having like-minded friends helps a lot

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640
and when I was thinking of this I don't

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,020
know if anyone's seen the show new girl

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,340
I don't know if I'll get in trouble for

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,960
this but I don't have anyone seen the

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,700
show new girl but there's a character in

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,939
there where they go to a party and his

46
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,380
whole plan at this party it's a party

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,360
with a celebrity and the whole plan is

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,700
to meet some new friends and become part

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,140
of a new friend group that's going to

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,640
raise him higher than his old friends

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,979
and he ends up realizing that the the

52
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,860
friends that he had a lot more things in

53
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,200
common and were more like him were a lot

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,399
better for him

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,020
and it ends up switching his mindset

56
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,520
completely and so I think that's

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,500
important for us too finding friends who

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
who have the same ideas as us and the

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
same interest is really important and

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,060
your friend groups are important to help

61
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,860
you thrive

62
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,160
and then for your social networks

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
I uh

64
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,340
I think LinkedIn is another thing that

65
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,900
gets a really bad rep because a lot of

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,540
times it's used just for for job hunting

67
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,760
and just for uh

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,620
a lot of vendors get on there and it

69
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,360
becomes kind of like a vendor page for

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,220
you it gets a little annoying but if you

71
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,959
make some solid connections

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,120
they're going to help make that a good

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,140
social network that you're going to want

74
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,660
to go to and it's

75
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,459
it's a really good opportunity another

76
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,660
one that I was thinking of is the

77
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,280
Discord for Saint con I actually spoke

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
with someone yesterday who was from out

79
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
of state and he said that when he got

80
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,180
invited he looked at the Discord on

81
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,519
Saint Khan or the saint Khan Discord and

82
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,620
he said that it really impressed him

83
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,879
because

84
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,760
we're more of a community than just like

85
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,160
a utility page where you go and and this

86
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,599
is what's going on at Saint Khan and I

87
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,280
just need to see what I'm came here for

88
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,019
a lot of us communicate on there and I

89
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,400
think that's a really good thing and and

90
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
we should look for more opportunities

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,180
like that like the the local Defcon

92
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,980
groups are something great I didn't know

93
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,980
anything about Defcon groups until my

94
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,500
undergrad in Hawaii and I was leaving

95
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,180
Hawaii and I was so scared because I was

96
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,120
like I I'm gonna leave and come to Utah

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,099
and I don't know anybody at security and

98
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,260
I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot and

99
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,599
and end up with no friends that have

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,940
this same mentality but then I Googled

101
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,040
Defcon group and I googled Utah and I

102
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,920
got the the dc435 group and found out

103
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,540
about that and it's been a really great

104
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,280
group for me

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,860
and then also I know we talk about like

106
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,480
muscle atrophy and how if you don't use

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,040
your muscles that you get rid of and I

108
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
think socializing is one of those that

109
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,340
that works a lot like those muscles

110
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,200
where if you don't exercise it's it's

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,500
easy to get rid of it and lose it

112
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,299
and so for utility the first one I came

113
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,220
up with Is Helping Hands so I don't know

114
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,319
if anyone hasn't seen Lord of the Rings

115
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm sorry if you haven't come on it came

116
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,360
out a long time ago but I love this part

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,640
because I think about it I hate the main

118
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,819
character in this show Frodo if he had

119
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,159
not had these friends he never would

120
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,319
have completed his objective and I think

121
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,599
I've seen that as something really

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,238
helpful with my experience in networking

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,620
because

124
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,358
I've had some projects especially

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,639
starting up a security department and

126
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,780
coming right out of college and not

127
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,000
knowing very much I could go to my

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
network about certain things that I

129
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,020
didn't understand and it works a lot

130
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,699
like a Google search but a lot more

131
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,919
fine-tuned and so if I had a question

132
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,740
about something with app security I met

133
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,479
a few people at St con that I networked

134
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,100
with that are really good at that so I

135
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,180
can go straight to them and be like hey

136
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,040
I had an idea about this what do you

137
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,479
think and then you get a really

138
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,880
fine-tuned surge of something from

139
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,040
someone you trust instead of a hundred

140
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
different things that Google tells you

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
that you don't know which one you can

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,540
trust

143
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,940
and then I think another great example

144
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,820
for me of this is I

145
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,400
I wanted I had a resume that I had

146
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,979
vetted through my undergrad school and

147
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,900
my graduate school and so I was like

148
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
this this resume has got to be great now

149
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,500
it's it's done by both of the career

150
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,780
counselors and then I was like you know

151
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,040
what why don't I take it to the

152
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,800
professionals that I've met at dc435 who

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
are actually working in the field and

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,860
actually hiring people like me

155
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,680
and they tore it apart and it was one of

156
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,360
the best experiences I've had with uh

157
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,520
with resumes because

158
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,500
I was able to hear from the people that

159
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,940
are actually doing

160
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,660
the hiring and hear exactly what they

161
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,940
want and it helped me fine-tune that

162
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,400
resume and really help me grow a

163
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,620
relationship with them as well

164
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,199
and then I was thinking another

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,240
another way that networking is useful I

166
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,180
play a game called Warframe and one of

167
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,380
the things that's amazing about that is

168
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,020
the community where you get in and it's

169
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,539
really hard to to begin game but because

170
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,220
the people kind of band together and

171
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,160
understand that then they help each

172
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,120
other

173
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,220
and it grows kind of a network where you

174
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,020
trust the people that are around you and

175
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,340
I think that's what we need to do with

176
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,560
our DC groups and then with our Discord

177
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
pages that we have where we can grow a

178
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
community that we can go to about

179
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,900
anything

180
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,000
the next part of utility is mentorship

181
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
which I think is extremely helpful I

182
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,960
think we need to move towards this as

183
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,660
much as we can I actually

184
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,319
I came last year at St con I came to

185
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,180
speak with somebody about a job that I

186
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,380
was applying to

187
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,000
I reached out to him and I said hey I

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
see you're going to be a saint con and

189
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm kind of interested in this position

190
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,979
and he said oh yeah I work there I'll

191
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,539
let you know and I found out that we had

192
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,460
a lot in common he actually did the same

193
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,380
graduate degree as me as at the same

194
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,400
school

195
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,979
and he's kind of grown as a mentor for

196
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,020
me and when I have like little dumb

197
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,400
questions or I'm kind of nervous about

198
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,199
something he's the one that'll help me

199
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,300
out with that and I think

200
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,160
if possible everyone should have a

201
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,680
mentor or a mentee because being a

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,740
mentor itself is just as powerful I'm

203
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,860
very uh I'm a strong Advocate that

204
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,360
teaching is one of the best forms of

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,220
learning where if you teach somebody

206
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,780
something and you can teach it to five

207
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,400
different people then you learn for

208
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,380
yourself what it means for real

209
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,479
and I know if you're interested in this

210
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,280
black hills information Securities

211
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
Discord page has its own section just

212
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,139
for finding mentors and getting mentors

213
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,860
and the last one's the one we're most

214
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,199
familiar with with opportunity and so

215
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,419
when we're talking about opportunity the

216
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,440
first thing that comes to mind is

217
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,840
getting jobs and

218
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,340
it's kind of the world that we live in

219
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,900
now that job hunting through connections

220
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,720
is really the only way to get a job

221
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
but also

222
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,139
using your connections can be really

223
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,479
helpful I know I have a co-worker who I

224
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,800
used to work with

225
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,979
he would hop on LinkedIn and Linkedin

226
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,020
has the option to put that you're open

227
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,160
to work

228
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,020
and so he turned it off

229
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,759
and then every six months he turned it

230
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,479
on

231
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,520
and then he'd have a bunch of recruiters

232
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,560
contact him and he'd say hey I I'm not

233
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,479
actually really interested in switching

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,280
jobs right now but I want to get

235
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,900
experience with interviewing and keep

236
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,180
that that interview

237
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,139
skill up and active and I I thought that

238
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,400
was such a cool idea because

239
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
interviewing is terrifying but if you're

240
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,720
so used to it when you actually need an

241
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,860
interview for a position or something

242
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,500
comes up if you have that skill ready

243
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,360
and up kept then it's going to be easy

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
when it comes to it

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
and then bringing ideas to life my

246
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
biggest idea for this is if anybody

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,319
knows dc435 is kind of a newer group and

248
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,440
it used to just be dc801 but one of the

249
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
members was up here in Cash Valley and

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
he said I don't want to have to commute

251
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,179
all the time and I know a few guys on my

252
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,000
network that are interested in this and

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
he started it

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
and now it's a thriving group and it's

255
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,740
kind of cool because you could see his

256
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,220
Network brought in the people from their

257
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,600
Network and it kind of grew like that

258
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
like a spider web and so ideas can come

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
to life through your network if you have

260
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,420
if you can fine tune it make sure your

261
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,920
network is powerful

262
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,420
and then like I talked about with social

263
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,300
networks learning is a lot better I I

264
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,899
can hop on Tick Tock or or Instagram and

265
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,760
spend time on there learning about

266
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
random facts of Science and stuff that

267
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,839
really isn't important or I could have

268
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,240
this cool Discord page or a cool slack

269
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,380
page where people are talking about

270
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,500
stuff in in my community that I can get

271
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,120
a lot more understanding and feel a lot

272
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,260
more

273
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,880
applicable and useful to my life

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,540
and so I wanted to throw in a few tips

275
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,580
and tricks that I've seen from from my

276
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,680
experience networking and the first one

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
is this one I think is the most

278
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,860
important one when you make a connection

279
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,899
on LinkedIn linkedin's so easy to just

280
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,459
hop on there I found the person hit

281
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,620
connect and then go on and hope that

282
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,660
they find it but they have an option

283
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,160
there it always says would you like to

284
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
leave a personalized note

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
and I never connect with anyone without

286
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,240
leaving a personalized note because if

287
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,220
anything it it makes it easier to oh

288
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,740
this person I I met at this and and that

289
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,940
makes sense why they tried to connect

290
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,800
with me but also it opens a

291
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
correspondence so if you didn't know how

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,220
LinkedIn works if you if you hit connect

293
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,200
and add a note it throws it into your

294
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,459
messages

295
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,620
and then that person is more likely to

296
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
respond to you and then start a

297
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,980
conversation with you and I'm going to

298
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,480
share a few examples of how that's

299
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
helped me after this

300
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
but another thing is uh that everyone

301
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
loves to talk about what they love I

302
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
learned this quite a few times and I've

303
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,920
seen it at use being useful especially

304
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,899
if you're married you'll notice this

305
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,360
your significant other loves to talk

306
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,440
about what they love and sometimes you

307
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
don't care about that but if you take

308
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,420
the time to to at least listen and try

309
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,279
and care it's going to help a lot with

310
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,779
those relationships and that's the same

311
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,279
thing with networking if you go to

312
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,660
somebody you don't know

313
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,459
find a common ground find something that

314
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,260
you're both interested in or something

315
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,519
that they're really interested in that

316
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,760
you can listen to and it'll go a long

317
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,500
way with forming a connection having

318
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,660
something to talk about later

319
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,120
and then the last one that no enemy has

320
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,260
too much health I don't know how to put

321
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,240
this but but I play a lot of video games

322
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,060
and I was thinking there's never

323
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,160
you don't have to be afraid like there's

324
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
there's never a way that you're going to

325
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,220
hurt yourself by taking a shot of trying

326
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,560
to connect with somebody

327
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,180
and a few other things I was thinking of

328
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,279
I was talking with I was networking

329
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,320
somebody upstairs earlier and he said

330
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,180
that if it gets a little awkward

331
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,519
cracking a joke always helps finding

332
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,779
something that you you think's funny

333
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,220
that they think is funny is going to

334
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,800
help ease that tension and then also it

335
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,500
works a lot like dating where having a

336
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,000
wingman is going to make you feel a lot

337
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
more confident they're going to be able

338
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
to bounce things off if if something

339
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,459
gets awkward they can kind of intervene

340
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,200
but that works a lot with networking I

341
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,540
have a friend who he was a lot more

342
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,760
introverted and it was interesting

343
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
because when we would go talk to people

344
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,779
my

345
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,760
my eye would come down and he would come

346
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,680
up and we'd kind of be on even grounds

347
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,420
and then we'd be able to network a lot

348
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,100
easier together and so I'm a big

349
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,360
advocate of finding a wingman and

350
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,760
working with that and finally just do it

351
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,880
it it's scary but you if you take that

352
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,740
shot and go and talk to someone you can

353
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,540
form a relationship that can help you a

354
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,519
lot in the future this actually I saw it

355
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,779
yesterday during the Keynote I I had a

356
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,160
few minutes before where I wasn't doing

357
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,440
anything and I sat next to someone and I

358
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,060
was kind of scared I was and then I

359
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,380
thought to myself hey you're going to be

360
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,459
talking about networking tomorrow and

361
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,200
you're scared to network how's that

362
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
going to look in your mind when you look

363
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
back at this and so I said you know what

364
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,420
let's let's bite the bull and I I

365
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,040
scooted a seat over and I introduced

366
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,600
myself and I actually had a great

367
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,980
conversation with him and I learned

368
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,779
about about him and made a connection

369
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,339
with him and I could use that in the

370
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,800
future if I need to for

371
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,839
for anything that I'd talk about earlier

372
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,079
and so I wanted to go over a few

373
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,480
examples kind of his inspiration of how

374
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,519
this has worked for me and how this can

375
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,220
work for you and so I've made a few

376
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,019
connections webinars or something I

377
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,760
don't know if you guys your inbox looks

378
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
anything like mine but I get webinar

379
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,300
invites all the time I'm like this is

380
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,000
this is Spam but one day I was like you

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,380
know what I'm this sounds like a cool

382
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,700
webinar I'm gonna go and attend it

383
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,079
because I have an hour that I'm not

384
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,220
doing anything

385
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,560
So I listened in

386
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,720
I found out that there was a

387
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,519
the guy was actually really cool he told

388
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
a really cool story about how he'd been

389
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,860
in jail as a child because he he grew up

390
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,320
poor and he had to become a con man and

391
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,180
he ended up turning that around and

392
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,040
becoming a pen tester and using that

393
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,079
knowledge to to do that and I was like

394
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,639
this guy's so cool I'd love to talk with

395
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,680
him more but I had no way to communicate

396
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,839
with him so I found him on LinkedIn and

397
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,940
I sent one of those personalized notes

398
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,440
and I had a little question in there I

399
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,639
said hey I loved what you said about

400
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,920
your life and it was really inspiring

401
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,339
and and I wonder how you do this and he

402
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,380
ended up contacting me back he connected

403
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,120
with me and then he said oh yeah if

404
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,620
you're interested in this and he gave me

405
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,760
a lot more information that was really

406
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
cool

407
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,300
and I've actually within school I had a

408
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,339
lot of really cool experiences reaching

409
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,800
out to the webinar context and it helped

410
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,160
me a lot when I needed a a speaker I I

411
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,899
was in charge of the speakers for Utah

412
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,940
State's Association of information

413
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,779
systems and I I had seen these other

414
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,279
people already speak and I knew there

415
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,200
were great speakers and I had that great

416
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,399
Network to be able to do that a lot

417
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,019
easier

418
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,240
one of those I I

419
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,639
was scared because he was a CEO of a

420
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,800
company and he had came and spoken in

421
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,260
one of my classes and I thought

422
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,720
why not why not try it the worst thing

423
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,279
that happens is he sees my connection he

424
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,019
hits the X and it's gone and he doesn't

425
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,700
ever think about me again but he ended

426
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
up connecting with me and any in my

427
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,820
message he said hey do you want to meet

428
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,920
for 30 minutes and I was like whoa what

429
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,120
and I ended up talking with him and I

430
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,500
had a great conversation he helped me

431
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,779
kind of figure out my path and what I

432
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,980
wanted to do

433
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,680
and it was great another time I I had

434
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,199
another person come and speak in person

435
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,639
and I asked to connect with him and he

436
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,899
said oh yeah what time are you free for

437
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,240
lunch and I was like oh I just wanted to

438
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,740
connect on LinkedIn man and he's like no

439
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,899
you'll take you out to lunch and it was

440
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,339
a really good experience and he helped

441
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,899
guide me as well

442
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,680
and then

443
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,120
yeah last year at Saint con I uh

444
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,100
I had decided I'm coming to St con I

445
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,500
want to I I'm not really from Utah I

446
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,300
don't know I'm not from a security

447
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,399
background my dad's a mechanical design

448
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,660
engineer so I don't know a lot of people

449
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,459
in security and my goal is to meet

450
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,079
people in security and inform a network

451
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,720
where I can have people that'll help me

452
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
in the future

453
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,260
and just people that I can communicate

454
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,660
with about that and grow my passion

455
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,940
and I saw that somebody was presenting

456
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,320
from a company that I love from a video

457
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,360
game company that I really liked

458
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,399
and I didn't have I was volunteering

459
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,779
last year so I don't have time to go and

460
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,720
see him at his presentation so I'm sorry

461
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,220
it came off as a little creepy but I

462
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,380
stalked him really bad I found his his

463
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,959
LinkedIn page I found out his name I

464
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,000
found out different things about him and

465
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
I went I went to people that I thought

466
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,519
wouldn't know him and I'm like hey do

467
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,540
you know this guy do you know where he

468
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,639
would be and I ended up finding him

469
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,220
through that at the lock picking booth

470
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,500
and he actually was really cool and

471
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,579
ended up giving me some really great

472
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,180
advice he he helped me understand I was

473
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,040
really curious how it is working for a

474
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,839
company that

475
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,540
does something that you love like if you

476
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,040
love it and then you go and work for

477
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,120
them is that going to kill the thing you

478
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,860
love originally and I didn't want that

479
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
so I was curious because I was applying

480
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,940
different jobs at that time

481
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,680
and he ended up telling me that that no

482
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,959
it's if you do it this way it helps a

483
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,220
lot if you're not working exactly in

484
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,839
that thing and that was a really great

485
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,360
experience for me

486
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,880
and so I kind of I felt like giving you

487
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,339
this information only matters if

488
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,600
something comes out of it because we

489
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,399
have sat through a lot of presentations

490
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,980
coming up and I wanted to kind of do a

491
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,019
Hands-On thing here so I wanted you guys

492
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,339
to find someone in the room that you

493
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,240
don't know

494
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,459
and try and put this to practice learn

495
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,600
something that you have in common with

496
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,459
them and then form a connection with

497
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,839
them it doesn't have to be connecting on

498
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,300
LinkedIn but maybe exchange what your

499
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,100
Discord handle is or something so that

500
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,959
you can actually communicate them with

501
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,160
them in the future if something comes up

502
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,480
where you want to talk with them so it's

503
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
going to take a few minutes and and just

504
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,599
allow you guys to go about this

505
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,180
I can see you all you're not doing this

506
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,260
foreign

507
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,799
okay I'm gonna

508
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,080
finish up here you know what

509
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,580
it's almost brought a tear to my eye

510
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,840
though this actually looks really good

511
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,539
I'm proud to see that I wasn't

512
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,760
presenting on something useless and that

513
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,559
at least if anything somebody out here

514
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,299
made a connection and that it will help

515
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,500
you I promise you it'll help you in the

516
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,580
future

517
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,159
and I just want to finish with here's my

518
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,500
my LinkedIn page right here I'm always

519
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,200
open to new opportunity and and I uh I

520
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,580
promise this isn't I'm not smart enough

521
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,400
to make this anything malicious but

522
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,100
I promise uh that it's my LinkedIn page

523
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,400
right here but I would advise you to be

524
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
my little worker bees and go out and

525
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
share what you learned here maybe share

526
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
something that you know that I didn't

527
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,480
share and network as much as you can

528
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,820
because if we can form a big spider web

529
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,220
of all of us within Saint con then we

530
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
can spread it out Beyond Saint con and

531
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,760
get more people to come and we're going

532
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,760
to have to pay for the Rel Salt Lake

533
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,620
Stadium to meet up sometime because

534
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,059
there's so many of us

535
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,179
but I have a strong belief that that

536
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,340
networking is really important and so

537
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm glad that you guys were able to do

538
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,500
something from that
