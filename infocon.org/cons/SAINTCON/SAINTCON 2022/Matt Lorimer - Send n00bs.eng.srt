not great not terrible kind of mediocre

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
that's set in the bar about where you

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
want this presentation to be if you're

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
expecting more than that I'm sorry the

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,220
badge talk is a couple Doors Down

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,360
um today's talk like I just mentioned

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,740
this is not the badge talk if that's

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,420
what you're looking for head on down the

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,580
down the hallway a little bit this is

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900
definitely aimed at people new to

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,420
infosec this is for people getting their

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,159
career started trying to make a jump

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,520
into infosec trying to jump into things

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,220
and just not this is not a this is not

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,420
going to be a deep dive we've got 30

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,439
minutes

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,140
um it's short like it says there

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,820
um there's not a ton of time I'm not

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,200
going to give you a list of tools I'm

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
not going to give you a list of like try

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
hack me and all the sites to go and

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,560
build up your skill set I'm not going to

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,060
go through and do a deep dive this is

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,979
kind of just the rent ramblings of an

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,479
old person who has talked to a lot of

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,979
people getting getting started in

51
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,600
infosec and making that transition in

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,799
their life

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
uh this this talk is a complete lie

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,399
um I wrote the synopsis when Chris

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,619
surashram asked me to do a presentation

56
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,380
on infosec 101 I went ahead and wrote

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,020
that uh little synopsis you read to

58
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,940
decide you wanted to come here

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,879
and then quite a bit later

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,860
a couple hours ago I wrote the

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,599
presentation

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,280
and they don't exactly match up 100 but

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,160
I I hope this is useful to you and it is

64
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,080
it is maybe a complete lie but hopefully

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,580
it's a useful lie

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,980
uh like to mention it's not tools uh

67
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,360
there's not a ton of ton of information

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,739
about those in here but we're just gonna

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm just going to go through and talk

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,940
and honestly if you have questions let's

71
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,860
ask questions let's talk if you have

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,300
comments and want to you want to go into

73
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,879
more depth I'm I've done this I've had

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,319
this conversation but I'm not the only

75
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,400
person in the room that's had this

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,660
conversation and that's kind of one of

77
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,800
the points I want to get out as we go

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
through this

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,860
um

80
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,239
so the first thing I want to talk about

81
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,800
is

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
get a mentor if you're new if you're

83
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,640
trying to get into infosec if you're

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
trying to get started if you don't know

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
what you're doing if you want to if you

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,140
want to transition to go to a new field

87
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,280
you've been doing

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
um you've been doing something like

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,239
working in the sock and you want to get

90
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,459
into GRC like the compliance pieces

91
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,080
first you should seek mental health

92
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,760
because no one wants to get in

93
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,319
compliance

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,599
but if you do decide you want your if

95
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,519
compliance is your thing then find a

96
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,019
mentor find someone who's been doing

97
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,500
that find someone who is experienced in

98
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,480
the field and who will talk to you

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
and all the time the question is how do

100
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
I get someone who will be my mentor how

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,819
do I find someone

102
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,500
you did the first step you showed up to

103
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,680
Saint Khan second you show up to if you

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
don't want to show up to St Khan show up

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,739
to one of the local communities or

106
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,019
groups in Salt Lake you've got 801 labs

107
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,200
in up north and Logan they've got dc435

108
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,860
you've got Saint Khan Discord you've got

109
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,099
um 801 Labs Discord DC I mean there are

110
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,080
thousands Black Hills infosec has a

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,060
fantastically active Discord and they do

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,620
a great job they have a whole Channel

113
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,959
dedicated to seeking mentors and finding

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,700
mentors

115
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,040
um look to the community and find people

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
you don't have to be best buddies with

117
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,340
with whoever this person you choose for

118
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
your Mentor but you do have to have a

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
relationship you do have to talk to them

120
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,739
um

121
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,079
I've had people walk up to me that have

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
never talked to me in their entire life

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,019
and they don't even introduce themselves

124
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,459
they're like hey I need a mentor you be

125
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,800
my mentor and I'm like um

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
talk about how this works I I'm happy to

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
help people and I'm happy to give advice

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,340
but there is a relationship in mentors

129
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,979
and mentees and so

130
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,139
find a mentor and as you find the mentor

131
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,000
build a relationship don't just go up

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,520
and expect and hope for a for a mentor

133
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
um

134
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
anyway

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,860
the next one here

136
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,240
is

137
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,820
don't be afraid to ask questions there's

138
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,160
no one that knows everything I I there's

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
not a single person in the world that

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
knows everything and a lot of times in

141
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,740
infosec we we feel like we have to have

142
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,300
all the answers

143
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,060
and people a lot of times talk I talk

144
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,139
about

145
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,580
um how they feel inadequate if they

146
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,600
don't have answers they feel like

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
they're not delivering or they're not

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
doing good enough

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,940
and honestly I see questions as someone

150
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,340
who's curious and curious tells me you

151
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,740
actually care about the field I'm way

152
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,740
more likely to help someone get a job be

153
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,840
their Mentor do whatever if they're

154
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,280
curious and interested and care about

155
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,360
the field

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
if I say things that are over your head

157
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,780
and you're like yeah yeah I'm like

158
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,220
either he knows everything I have

159
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,259
nothing nothing to offer this this guy

160
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,440
or gal or they don't give a crap and

161
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,520
they're just nodding their head and it

162
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,139
doesn't matter what I say the heads the

163
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,820
response is going to be the same

164
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,560
so don't be afraid to ask questions it

165
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,660
actually shows interest it shows passion

166
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,240
it shows skill

167
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
um

168
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,300
this is going to be a short presentation

169
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,199
it's 30 minutes but we're going quick

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,400
um

171
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,979
so don't be afraid to ask questions

172
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,780
don't be afraid to talk to people and I

173
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,460
well anyway we'll save time for

174
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,039
questions at the end but if you talk to

175
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
them and ask questions and and go into

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,060
detail one of the things that we often

177
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,880
talk about is I when you when I was

178
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,039
hiring people when I was getting people

179
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,139
in for a job I can teach you how to do

180
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,139
things but I can't teach you how to care

181
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,500
and so one of your jobs as a person

182
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,600
applying for a job is a person trying to

183
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,580
get into something is to show that you

184
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,419
care

185
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,880
how do you show you care with

186
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,600
interesting questions

187
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,880
um I got an eye chart for you here

188
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,220
this is most people feel the route into

189
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,340
infosec is this this is all this is

190
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,919
updated August of 2022.

191
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,660
this is the current certifications

192
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,460
within the field of information security

193
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,139
and actually if you're thinking about

194
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,600
any certification you need to write down

195
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
that URL or just search Paul Jeremy with

196
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,919
an i

197
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,680
and his certification roadmap

198
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
because whether you want to get searched

199
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,880
or not this is a fantastic this shows

200
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,380
you a ton about what search are

201
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,360
available and what what's out there

202
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,120
I love how it's broken into categories

203
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,639
whether it's operations assessment risk

204
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,819
management

205
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,240
but

206
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,460
I'm here to say

207
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,979
certs have their place and it depends on

208
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,240
who you are as to whether they have a

209
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,979
place in your life

210
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,720
if you're brand new you have no

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,020
experience you have no skill or you have

212
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,639
you have no background you have nothing

213
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,560
to put on your resume assert might be

214
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,340
good

215
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,139
but honestly you're going to start down

216
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,720
here towards the bottom of this chart so

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,220
if you're in that category you start

218
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,139
looking down here and like oh maybe I

219
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,280
want to get

220
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
uh if you go to the actual website if

221
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,319
you Google that all of these are pop-ups

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
he shows tells you what it is he has

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
links to deeper information and he even

224
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
gives you the price of the test and

225
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,819
stuff on this on this chart when you go

226
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,860
to the website like it's

227
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,780
this chart is outstanding so if you're

228
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,099
thinking about search check it out but

229
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,139
it's great but look at the bot look

230
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,340
towards the bottom of this chart and

231
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,720
start looking at some of those charts or

232
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,759
some of those but honestly I'm here to

233
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,880
say

234
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,199
I don't know anyone who's gotten a job

235
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,419
purely because of certifications

236
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,759
certifications are not the answer to a

237
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,080
transition and an entrance into

238
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,060
information security if you have

239
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,520
experience use your experience if you

240
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,259
don't have experience maybe get some

241
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,599
certs but better get some certs and some

242
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,879
experience

243
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,539
and that experience doesn't have to be a

244
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,500
job

245
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,720
I've I've interviewed and hired people

246
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,840
that their experience consists of well

247
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,940
I've got you know if how many guys have

248
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,799
visited home Labs here the home Labs

249
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
Booth downstairs on the first floor

250
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,860
okay so that right there that's

251
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,260
experience that's passion that's

252
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,300
interest that's all the things wrapped

253
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,440
into one

254
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,959
if I have someone that has four certs if

255
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,519
I'm a hiring manager I have someone that

256
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,080
has four certs and I have a guy who's

257
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,600
been or a girl who's been running

258
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,700
um

259
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,680
cerakata and Zeke and in their basement

260
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,420
on their home internet connection and

261
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,220
they're like I want to get into doing

262
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,959
incident response and I want to get into

263
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,360
threat detection

264
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,580
well let's see one guy has a sticker and

265
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,380
you know one of these applicants has a

266
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,180
sticker and this girl over here has been

267
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,880
doing it for two years in her basement

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
tell you who I'm going to hire

269
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,060
I don't care that they've been working

270
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,500
at McDonald's they've been doing this

271
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,060
for two years and I don't care that no

272
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,140
one paid them to do it they've been

273
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,120
doing it

274
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,980
and so

275
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,899
certs are important but they have their

276
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,760
place I guess that's the moral of the

277
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,140
story there's a great resource if you

278
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,120
want info about certs but more than if

279
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,160
you want info about certs know that they

280
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,660
have their place

281
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,320
um

282
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
some jobs some things you'll need your

283
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,420
cissp to get them so there there are

284
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,640
some places for various reasons

285
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,540
organizational policy for compliance

286
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,800
there are several of these that are

287
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,540
needed for certain types of audits and

288
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,240
checks and compliance reasons so certs

289
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,500
are great and you should look at them

290
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,779
you should consider them but they're not

291
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,820
a Magic Bullet it's a lot of times

292
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,019
you'll go to school and they're like if

293
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,760
you get these two stickers next to your

294
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,940
name you'll get a job for 180 000 as an

295
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,800

297
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,180
um

298
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,620
they're not a Magic Bullet

299
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,300
wow sorry

300
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,940
um so this part here just get a next

301
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,200
thing we talked about getting getting

302

experience get a job get a job in the

303
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,660
field and I this can be this is a couple

304
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,920
of folds we talked about the community

305
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,899
and building our relationships

306
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,940
when you have a job you build a lot of

307
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,580
relationships get a job related to the

308
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,680
field you're trying to get into even if

309
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,240
it's just like

310
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,700
um you want to get into infosec and the

311
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
only job you can get is

312
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,540
the

313
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,420
the person who configures printers at

314
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,860
the help desk

315
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
what you're going to meet somebody who

316
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,279
two years down the road is going to be

317
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
hiring a sock analyst and now all of a

318
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
sudden you have that relationship and

319
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,220
you go to them and say Hey I want to be

320
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,380
a sock analyst they say great let's go

321
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,760
you've got the experience you've got

322
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,320
things built up

323
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,260
but it's not easy like this so you why

324
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,360
not strap on a helmet job helmet squeeze

325
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
down a job can't a fire from job land

326
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
where they grow on little jobbies

327
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,140
it's true jobs can be hard to get

328
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,360
but that's why

329
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
things are important you need to you

330
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,000
need to pay attention you need to look

331
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,260
at how you do it you need to look at how

332
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,720
you apply when you I I can't tell you

333
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,579
how many times as I was hiring positions

334
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,860
I'd put on job requirements and I would

335
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,839
get people who I was pretty sure were

336
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,700
who were pretty who are qualified for

337
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,620
the position and half the job

338
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,300
requirements were never mentioned on

339
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,920
their resume or on their cover letter or

340
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,120
anything else

341
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,100
be complete be thorough show the person

342
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,040
you care if you literally copy and paste

343
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,019
the same resume to 100 people do you

344
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,640
really think these intelligent managers

345
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,079
are stupid enough that they won't know

346
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,420
that's what you did

347
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,000
treat them with respect

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
and treat them with the dignity you

349
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,300
expect I must be doing good because my

350
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,320
own son just walked out of my

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,740
presentation

352
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,660
I won't be offended if anyone does I'm

353
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,720
not even offended he did it's okay

354
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,800
um

355
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,540
so trade him worth respect give them the

356
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,800
give them time they're going to give you

357
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,300
time to consider you as an applicant

358
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,640
give them time to actually address what

359
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,040
they're looking for and reach out to

360
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
them find people you know within the

361
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,700
company reach out to them do do a little

362
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,740
OS hint like open source intelligence

363
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,079
gathering

364
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,820
to see who you know reach out to your

365
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,160
community networks I I've seen more than

366
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,500
once on Discord on the Utah Saint

367
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,600
Discord Discord where people like hey

368
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm applying for a job at company X does

369
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
anyone know someone who works there

370
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,740
pretty much every time I've seen that

371
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,019
someone says oh yeah I work there or my

372
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,899
brother works there or I you know I I

373
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,880
met this lady at St con two years ago

374
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
and she works there let me give you her

375
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,639
number

376
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,160
if you get someone to refer you into the

377
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,260
organization that often gets you past

378
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,720
the first two steps of filtering that's

379
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,579
a hundred percent worth five minutes of

380
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,200
your time find someone you know there

381
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,660
then take five more minutes to customize

382
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,940
your resume for that for that specific

383
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,139
job posting and listening

384
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,060
all the people that have jobs are going

385
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,200
to look at me saying you weren't kidding

386
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,660
when you said Noobs

387
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,740
um

388
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,079
the other part here is you have to apply

389
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,779
you like go find the job do the

390
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,279
application put in your res put in your

391
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,620
resume put in the work but as you do the

392
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,300
application

393
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
um

394
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,420
show your interest and show your passion

395
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,079
your your job not every hiring manager

396
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,700
is different everybody does things their

397
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
own way so I'm not trying to say there's

398
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,660
one Silver Bullet but this is general

399
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,519
rules

400
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,100
um

401
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,779
as you go there and as you work with as

402
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,240
you try to find these look for the jobs

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,579
use your network find those apply and uh

404
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,380
don't be afraid a lot of times people

405
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,120
like well they're looking for you know

406
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,300
they want they want level X and I I

407
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,459
don't have that

408
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,040
turns out in today's job market there's

409
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,660
a lot of compromises being made by

410
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,220
hiring managers

411
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,500
don't lie about yourself don't say you

412
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
can do things you can't

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,740
but also don't be afraid to throw your

414
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,000
resume out there I mean what's the worst

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
thing that happens they say no

416
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,480
guess what you don't put your resume out

417
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,700
there the answer is no

418
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,320
you probably won't hear back don't be

419
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,600
offended you'll send out 800 resumes and

420
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,420
you'll hear back from 750 of them or you

421
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,240
won't hear back from 750 of them that's

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
okay

423
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
okay I hope you don't have to send out

424
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,260
800 resumes to get a job I hope it's

425
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,060
more like

426
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,240
15 or 20. but you won't hear back from a

427
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,519
lot of they'll ghost you that happens HR

428
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,380
does it the hiring manager does it

429
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,660
sometimes it's malicious sometimes it's

430
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,639
lazy sometimes it's bad practices it

431
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,980
could be whatever just assume the best

432
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,240
and assume people are trying to help but

433
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,500
um this is the other one here a lot of

434
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,019
people early in their career I in fact I

435
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,160
had a conversation a couple days ago

436
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,959
with one with somebody who was like well

437
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
I've got a job but it's not a very good

438
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,199
job and I can't really look for a job

439
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,180
because I've got this oh

440
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,699
this is even trades man I put in work

441
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,440
you give me money at the end of that

442
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,180
transaction we're done this is a

443
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,800
transactional trade

444
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,959
do you really think that if your work

445
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,699
thinks you're not worth what they're

446
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,560
paying you they will just keep paying

447
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,540
you forever no

448
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,519
if you think that they're not paying you

449
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,079
what you're worth should you keep

450
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,579
working for them forever

451
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,920
no if you love your workplace then talk

452
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,440
to them and say hey guys I'm not happy

453
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,660
go to your boss go to HR and say I'm not

454
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,300
happy I could be making x amount and

455
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,459
they might say get a competitive offer

456
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,079
and that might be the dumbest thing they

457
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,600
ever did because that's why that's

458
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,300
that pushes people into new jobs if they

459
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,500
want a competitive offer but that's

460
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,760
their choice

461
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
you love the place you work get a

462
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,060
competitive offer you might just like

463
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,339
the new place better and that's the way

464
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,880
they work but don't I mean be loyal to

465
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,860
your company and be be good to them but

466
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,680
realize that this is a transaction

467
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,019
you give them work in exchange for money

468
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,060
they give you money in exchange for work

469
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,339
after this transaction you owe them

470
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,320
nothing and they owe you nothing

471
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
so if you're in a job that's below what

472
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,100
you want to be what you think you should

473
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,680
be where you hope to be

474
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,300
then don't be

475
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,240
polish your resume go look for a job go

476
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,880
go out on networking sites and say hey

477
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm currently a junior sock analyst and

478
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,220
I'd really like to get into

479
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,680
um threatened or threat intelligence I'd

480
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,959
really like to get into incident

481
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,899
response great let's do that

482
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,959
find a new job and don't feel guilty

483
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,060
about it at all zero guilt in this

484
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,000
transaction because that's what it is a

485
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,040
transaction

486
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,660
um

487
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,339
and I think the last couple are extra

488
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,740
leftover slides from uh

489
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,720
whose slide Is It Anyways

490
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,660
this these last ones here I would I one

491
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,380
of the things I was going to talk about

492
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,939
is some of the people who have a newer

493
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,720
infosec practice at their organization

494
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,980
often I have people who are somewhere

495
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,319
who has a very immature infosec program

496
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,980
or who are just starting

497
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,900
they you get thrown into an organization

498
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,699
that you're the first information

499
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:21,900
security professional in the

500
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,760
organization or something happens this

501
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,020
is pretty true the breaches will

502
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,699
continue until security policy actually

503
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,220
improves I see a lot of people that are

504
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,080
starting a program running around and

505
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,660
doing things they've seen other places

506
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,580
oh this person has a vulnerability

507
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,960
scanner okay I'm going to get a

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,520
vulnerability scanner ooh this person

509
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,260
has a email Gateway I'm going to get an

510
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,020
email Gateway these are great things

511
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,539
but if you're just doing things you see

512
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,700
somewhere else you're not actually

513
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,100
fixing a problem you're just throwing

514
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Band-Aids around and hoping for the best

515
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,980
so if you're doing this you need if

516
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,240
you're starting a new program you need

517
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,919
to start strategically and this is a

518
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,000
part of training and showing the

519
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,980
interest the the best way to do

520
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,539
something to do information security

521
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,120
strategically is to choose a framework

522
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,679
and that's a nasty word and I'm not

523
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,940
going to talk about I'm not going to go

524
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,720
deep

525
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,400
the two the two things I'll say about

526
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,919
Frameworks the biggest things are CSF

527
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,860
the nist cyber security framework and

528
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,200
CIS controls

529
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,960
this CSF is a PhD thesis if you love

530
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,600
those go to CSF if you hate PhD thesis

531
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,900
and you prefer novel go CIS controls if

532
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,480
you have regulatory reasons go Miss CSF

533
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,940
otherwise go CIS controls

534
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,860
go read about those learn more on your

535
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,520
own

536
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,500
one of them can fit on a four-page

537
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,539
brochure one of them can barely fit into

538
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,299
an 8 800 page document like you choose

539
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,299
which of those sounds more fun to you

540
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,980
um

541
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,039
anyway I'm

542
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,660
and the last one here this kind of goes

543
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,740
with what I said about information

544
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,020
secure information programs if you do

545
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,120
things you might have API security you

546
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,440
might have app security you might have

547
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,600
firewall but if you don't have a

548
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,760
framework you forget about the databases

549
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,520
you forget about the various the some of

550
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,380
the sensitive pieces of your thing this

551
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,360
is why strategy matters this is why a

552
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,340
framework matters this is why a cohesive

553
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,740
plan and an organizational structure

554
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,960
matters

555
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,580
um

556
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,220
so I'm going to stop here mostly because

557
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,020
I'm out of funny gifts because I I put

558
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,340
them all into whose slide Is It Anyways

559
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,960
instead of this but I'm going to stop

560
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,760
here and I just want to

561
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,679
any other

562
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,720
tips questions comments thoughts

563
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
anything else from anyone else here

564
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,500
do we have a house mic

565
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,580
all right so shout out loud and I'll say

566
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,200
it again if anyone if you have something

567
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,500
to say

568
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,480
Java forever

569
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,320
foreign

570
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
honestly python is rust is the shiny I'm

571
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
not a programmer don't I'm not the one

572
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
to ask but on what I see is everyone

573
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,260
gets excited about rust but everyone

574
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,360
always comes back to python it always

575
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,720
comes back to python go with shiny rust

576
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,419
is shiny in a year they may or may not

577
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,340
be here I guarantee python will still be

578
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,520
here

579
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,660
laughs okay rust looks pretty it's not

580
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,220
shiny it looks pretty you're right Fair

581
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,940
I'll take it I I would say python is

582
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,100
really good it's easy to learn it's easy

583
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,039
to step through it is a consistent thing

584
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,960
within the industry

585
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,419
that's where I would go any

586
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,280
anyone's welcome to disagree with me on

587
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,139
that but that's my knee-jerk response

588
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,520
on the back I can I can kind of see a

589
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,200
hand through the bright sunshine

590
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,480
honestly what I do when I I that's a

591
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,860
that's a fantastic question you asked

592
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,740
how I how I customize resumes for jobs

593
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,080
and what I do is I sit down with a job

594
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,700
description in one window on the left

595
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,080
side of my on the left side of my

596
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,340
monitor and on the right side of my

597
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,100
monitor I have my resume and I go bullet

598
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
point by bullet point by bullet point of

599
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,720
what the job requirements are for that

600
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,620
job

601
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,960
and on the right side of my resume I

602
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,640
write my experience with that bullet

603
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,919
point and it might be I read a white

604
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,220
paper it might be I labbed that up and I

605
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,780
leave off the last night part of the

606
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,400
ilab.op

607
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,280
it might be I've been doing that for 10

608
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,620
years but every single bullet point on

609
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,539
the job requirement I write an answer on

610
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,059
the right and then at the end I take my

611
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,159
list of what I all those bullet points

612
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,740
and I put them in a master resume and my

613
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,020
master resume is like three times longer

614
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,640
than it needs to be

615
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,140
and then I get to the next job

616
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,059
description and I say oh look I have

617
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,620
these four bullet points in this master

618
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,299
resume these ones are coming back over

619
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,640
into this custom resume

620
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,559
oh but I don't have one for this so I

621
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,059
write another one and then I add that to

622
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,520
the master resume

623
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
and that way every single resume or

624
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,559
every single job all the requirements

625
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,600
listed are addressed in the resume for

626
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
that company but I'm not killing myself

627
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,559
because I have the master resume with

628
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,440
all of the all the my skill sets and

629
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,919
what I've done

630
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,720
so I've discovered this is cultural

631
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,820
a lot there are some cultures I have

632
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,158
received a 28-page resume before

633
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,760
and I was like what in the heck is this

634
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,039
and it had their high school transcripts

635
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,039
and their college transcripts and like

636
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,020
three pages on the things they studied

637
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,580
in high school and everything and so

638
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,780
it's cultural

639
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,059
my personal preference it depends on

640
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,200
where you are in your career if you're

641
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,659
starting it should be one page if you're

642
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,299
10 years in if you're 12 years in it

643
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,039
could be a couple pages

644
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,860
but again respect the time of the hiring

645
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,500
manager who's in there to hire if you

646
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,140
have two pages of bullcrap it don't even

647
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,659
bother if you can filter it down to one

648
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,780
page filter it down to one page

649
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,480
it shorter is I

650
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,580
the hiring managers you think about what

651
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,080
would I want to read if I had 20 of

652
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,580
these to read tomorrow

653
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,539
I want shorter

654
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,740
yeah and that this is where the job

655
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,179
description comes in really helpful you

656
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,100
read what they're looking for and make

657
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,960
sure if you have like if they're looking

658
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,059
for a governance risk and compliance

659
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,919
there it's a GRC position and you're

660
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,620
like I've played with all these red team

661
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,620
tools and I know I know Bloodhound and I

662
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,080
know how to do crack Mac crack map exec

663
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,940
and I know how to do all they don't care

664
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,240
about that for GRC so yeah Whittle it

665
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,020
down to what matters

666
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,840
any other

667
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
all right right here

668
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,900
foreign

669
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,340
I don't want to talk to people you don't

670
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,960
want to talk to people you put in

671
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,520
Discord do you have many badges and

672
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,539
people will hunt you down

673
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
people will come and find you and they

674
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,380
will talk to you

675
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,120
um but really it depends on the person

676
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,159
whether you're uh if you prefer text

677
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,380
based then spend more time building your

678
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,059
network and Discord

679
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,679
and then once you have a relationship

680
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,659
then meet the people in person

681
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,820
but a lot of it is it's this cliche

682
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,500
answer step out of your comfort zone do

683
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,260
things that are hard but like it there's

684
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,059
no there's no magic thing you haven't

685
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,880
heard a hundred times talk to people and

686
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,559
it's going to be hard and it's not going

687
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,140
to feel natural but that's the beauty of

688
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,679
being somewhere like this realize every

689
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,440
we're all the same I mean everyone finds

690
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,179
ways to be different from everyone else

691
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,279
and to say you're not like me find ways

692
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,080
to be like other people because really

693
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,720
you're probably 98 like every single

694
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
person in this room

695
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,200
so let's acknowledge the 98 and not

696
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,059
focus on that two percent and say I hate

697
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,500
talking to people so do you so let's

698
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,779
kind of be awkward next to each other

699
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,919
like let's call it fair

700
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,860
ly those don't speak to the people you

701
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,158
work with

702
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,059
so I don't know if everyone heard that

703
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,340
he said during particularly St Khan this

704
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,080
is a great advice that's from comp who's

705
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,360
also on the committee at St con but

706
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,080
um

707
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,419
during during Saint con sit down as the

708
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,039
largest table and make an effort to at

709
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,539
least say hi and get to know the name of

710
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,100
every single person on the table don't

711
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,659
just sit by your co-workers for every

712
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,340
single meal and everything you do

713
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,380
and it'll it'll pay off it'll pay

714
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,380
dividends and honestly 80 of the people

715
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,760
you talk to you won't talk to again

716
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,020
you'll forget their name you won't know

717
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,760
what's going on but they'll be one and

718
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,620
they might become your mentor

719
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,900
I have my job because I sat down at a

720
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,059
table at St Khan and I talked to the guy

721
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,820
next to me literally like he I said I

722
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,260
was looking for a job and he said come

723
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,960
work for me come work with me and that's

724
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,500
why I'm here

725
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,620
so

726
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,419
I think we're

727
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,400
we have three more minutes am I supposed

728
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,640
to be done now three minutes

729
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,340
there's any other questions

730
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,740
sorry I'm trying to not

731
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,820

framework I'm not familiar with that but

738
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,820
it says it goes through all the cyber

739
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
security roles and functions and go

740
