1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
hi everyone Thanks for uh

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,680
thanks for coming to my talk I'm Sean

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,839
Wallace I'm a head of threat modeling at

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,540
PayPal and my talks titled threat

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,120
modeling in a crypto Haunted World

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,000
I do not have a book

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,279
this is a just a Photoshop of a Carl

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,800
Sagan book but I thought it was very

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
fitting so

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,699
um

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,740
let's see on a Defcon goon black hat

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,840
volunteer so I've been in the community

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,099
a while

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,560
advisor to silent push which is a DNS

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,780
security and interview company

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,059
and live in the San Francisco Bay Area

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,700
disclaimer the Talk's going to go over

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,739
today a lot we're going to start out

19
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,360
talking about what threat modeling is

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
some very basics

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,140
and then get into some fun stuff talking

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,140
about cryptocurrency and uh the threats

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,480
that that happen there

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
I'll try to really cover stuff that's

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,379
unique to cryptocurrency and not stuff

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,219
that maybe overlap with your basic

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,500
security things and then kind of wrap it

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
up about

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,220
why all this matters and and what I

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
learned going through this for a

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,240
cryptocurrency

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,060
um so as you see here you know

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,220
really the importance of threat modeling

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,920
is really to help identify priorities

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,619
that's what I do in my job

36
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,619
and I identify what should we prioritize

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,299
on or what should we solve where should

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,000
we spend our money what is this not okay

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
what is okay let's focus over here

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
to do that it really has a large

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,119
communication aspect of that working

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,240
with teams partnering with teams

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,439
understanding what they do understanding

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,720
the threats

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
identifying those threats and then

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,340
really putting this all together so I

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,740
like it I think this is

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,640
um one of the

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,040
jobs in infosec that is on the Sky Rise

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,079
everyone is now investing in threat

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,659
modeling and that's kind of why I

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,280
came to do it I thought it was a pretty

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,459
exciting thing and I get to understand

54
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,380
and see all the threats as they come in

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,519
which is pretty fun

56
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,640
the main focus of extract modeling

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,099
really is about the shift left mentality

58
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,099
and the reason this is important if you

59
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,160
look at how we do security where

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,959
everything's after deployment

61
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,060
you you pass so many things if you're

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,560
identifying vulnerabilities after

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,540
deployment you're spending time

64
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,800
developing vulnerabilities you're

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
spending time testing vulnerabilities

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,180
you're spending time deploying them then

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,420
you're in teams testing them right now

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,140
um

69
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,319
let's say a hacker finds them or you

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,780
know bug Bounty finds them now you got

71
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,180
to go reinvest fixing that creating Tech

72
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,000
debt and think of all the ROI that

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,620
you're saving is if you can move that

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,780
and say well let's find and identify

75
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,700
those vulnerabilities during that actual

76
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
design phase

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,959
so that's where we're investing money to

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,480
do that to really kind of lower down

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
the amount of vulnerabilities that we're

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
putting out post-production and that Roi

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,080
pays for itself meaning I can build a

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,659
bigger team and we can deliver more

83
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,379
secure product

84
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,599
so

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
threat modeling in itself is very vague

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,860
just like threat threat hunting is you

87
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,200
know I was on a pope sock and as he said

88
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
that it kind of really keyed into me is

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
it means a lot of things but it's

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,659
working with a lot of these teams right

91
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,480
risk assessments threat assessments red

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,760
team purple team your bug mounting teams

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,620
your incident teams taking all of this

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,360
data in and really understanding what's

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,500
valuable

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,599
uh leveraging them they all have

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,640
different focuses and that's why I feel

98
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,620
like in threat modeling it's really

99
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,239
about that communication and that

100
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,640
prioritization that's important if

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,450
you're able to kind of put that together

102
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,640
[Music]

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,159
you're the hero for everyone an example

104
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,519
of this is

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
for our crypto product we went through

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,799
seven eight nine maybe different threat

107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,080
models not threat models but of these

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
various assessments

109
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,780
and at the end the CTO was of the

110
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,519
cryptocurrency product was kind of

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,079
frustrated and kind of threw his hands

112
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,959
up and he's like wow we did this seven

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,699
eight assessments and now all I have is

114
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,100
a ton of tech debt that I need to go fix

115
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,500
and he looked at me and said look can

116
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,419
you help prioritize tell me which ones

117
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,620
are important tell me which one's

118
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,020
overlap tell me what I need to go do

119
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,120
I took that as a win because of out of

120
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,860
all the teams he came to our team and

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,100
kind of said that so

122
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,540
um I kind of went over some of these

123
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,919
already but things you really are

124
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,440
looking out for too many hooks too many

125
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,720
people when you're doing 79 assessments

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,580
on things frustration is going to come

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,340
in that Tech debt fatigue is coming in

128
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,080
of like wow now you're creating more

129
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,300
problems and solutions are you really

130
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,160
helping me right

131
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,919
and you start to people start to lose uh

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
credibility when you have too much of

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,060
that fatigue so in our case with

134
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,500
cryptocurrency you're doing with new

135
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,380
technology many different smes new

136
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,900
processes new regulations one of the

137
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,780
major issues I had with the SME area is

138
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,400
every time I

139
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
went to talk to somebody they said well

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
you need to go talk to so and so and it

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,940
was just this tree of 20 to 30 people

142
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
that I kind of got to so that was kind

143
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,220
of frustrating

144
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,720
so there are several

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,419
threat modeling Frameworks out there

146
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,699
I'm not a really fan of any of them but

147
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,560
the one thing that I do like about them

148
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,199
like let's try it here is it gives you a

149
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,820
check and balance for you to kind of go

150
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,520
through and say huh did I really think

151
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,139
about each of these areas do I think

152
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,340
about spoofing and I think about

153
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,759
tampering right do I need to look more

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,340
or dig more into them

155
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,500
so that's really kind of how I leverage

156
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,440
this but I just kind of really want to I

157
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,780
really want to make sure that I focus on

158
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,000
real threats that people actually do

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,060
have executed executed or will execute

160
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
against us in the future and not those

161
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,880
Theory crafting or theoretical ones

162
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,620
kind of the scope is a really big

163
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,780
important thing and this will play into

164
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,280
the next slides when I talk about

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,000
threats the reason is is

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
we're rolling out we rolled out

167
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,940
cryptocurrency

168
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,680
so initially I kind of looked at all

169
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,419
threats of cryptocurrency but we had a

170
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,340
pretty narrow scope we only had like

171
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,979
five different currencies we only had a

172
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,139
couple different countries we only had a

173
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,580
couple different products we were

174
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,220
launching so I didn't necessarily need

175
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,500
to get crazy and focus a lot on various

176
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,840
type of attacks that maybe weren't

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
really going to happen so that's why the

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
scope was really kind of important

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,780
because I could spend forever learning

180
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,880
and being invested in what's going on in

181
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
the cryptocurrency world

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,360
but I'm a technologist and it's really

183
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
more about focusing kind of going deep

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
when I need to and then moving on to the

185
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,419
next thing in my threat modeling

186
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,080
portfolio

187
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,120
so cryptocurrency what's different from

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,780
like fiat currency or other just normal

189
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,580
threats right get a lot of new

190
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,440
challenges get new threats you get

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,759
threats against blockchain we'll get

192
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,199
into all those

193
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,479
a lot of it's irreversible you make you

194
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,060
make a you make a purchase and it's you

195
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,860
can't reverse funds like you can with

196
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,479
you know your banking account oh they

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,039
stole some money can you reverse that

198
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,039
within that three-day window or whatnot

199
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,979
it's Anonymous right you actually steal

200
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,680
money by hacking computers a lot of you

201
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
will say well you know I can do that

202
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,460
with a bank and whatnot well

203
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,440
the currency can just disappear on a

204
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,819
computer and I'll talk about some

205
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,039
instances where that has happened

206
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,500
you have blockchains at Fork right off

207
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,539
to new ones you have different attacks

208
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,580
with that and you have a very

209
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,099
interesting dilemma with regulations

210
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,319
right they're still being built on the

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,780
year by year basis and they're just not

212
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,580
there like they are with your normal

213
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,039
currency

214
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,080
so before I get to the next slide just a

215
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
disclaimer you know if you're prone to

216
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,759
dizziness uh this one's a little active

217
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,740
and a little fast moving or if you're

218
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,000
also uh

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,759
sensitive to overwhelming threats

220
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,400
you may want to look away so

221
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,259
the real intent of the slide is just

222
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,660
kind of to give you some sense of the

223
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,660
last many years of all the things that

224
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,399
are coming to cryptocurrency all the

225
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,839
attacks and all the money that's getting

226
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,458
lost and at speed I remember there was

227
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,659
one

228
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,000
number that stood out that said one in

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
three crypto exchanges have been hacked

230
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,380
right and that's a huge number

231
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,660
the other interesting thing I find are

232
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,120
these companies will come up and then

233
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,459
disappear essentially overnight they'll

234
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,220
get hacked and they'll just dissipate

235
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,600
and then lawsuits happen but because

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,399
there are no regulations because there's

237
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,200
so much gray area

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,899
this is okay right and this is

239
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,519
overwhelming and this is why it's

240
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,860
dangerous and essentially why I'm here

241
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,680
threat modeling it

242
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,420
so now we're going to kind of go into

243
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,540
the various threats which is pretty

244
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,640
exciting so I'll talk about some

245
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,279
examples on each of these

246
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,740
really most importantly is just kind of

247
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,240
your your architecture and County Key

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,580
Management right this is one of those

249
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,200
cases where you really need a

250
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,060
multi-layer architecture

251
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,920
put the things that need internet facing

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,140
on the outer layer and then start to

253
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,140
build your layer inward of

254
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,560
least trusting to most trusting right in

255
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,779
a slider too we'll talk about various

256
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,860
wallets

257
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,040
and you'll want your protected

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,880
cold Wallets on the inner layer while

259
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,160
your hot wallets were on the outer layer

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,860
right so this is definitely not a three

261
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,540
architecture

262
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,339
architecture you really need a

263
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,839
three-tier architecture you really will

264
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,300
need those layers to kind of help

265
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,519
protect you and protect you from this

266
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
key management is very important you

267
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,940
don't want one person holding the keys

268
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,160
you really need to have various

269
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,620
multi-factor in K in play for your

270
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,800
admins to be able to move things because

271
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,899
guess what Insider threats are real for

272
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,300
cryptocurrency they can just take that

273
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,240
money move it and then disappear right

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
because they're moving hundreds of

275
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,480
millions of dollars and just disappear

276
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,040
from the country they may be set for

277
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,740
life right and move to somewhere that

278
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,500
you don't even know so

279
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
um logging is very important so you can

280
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,399
kind of track what's seeing and it's

281
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,899
going to help you build better controls

282
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,540
when you understand oh I didn't realize

283
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,160
that either we didn't have logs for this

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,959
or this didn't happen or this wasn't

285
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,300
supposed to happen this way or

286
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,459
let's come up with a better solution

287
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,040
hot cold wallets so I think of this more

288
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,380
as like a wallet that's in your pocket

289
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
and then like a wallet that's maybe in

290
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,640
your mattress or something right one of

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
them is highly accessible one of them's

292
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,380
less successful right

293
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,000
how they use this in cryptocurrency is

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,279
your hot wallet is the one you keep

295
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
connected to the internet where you can

296
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,700
access and exchange money but your cold

297
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,680
wallet is one that is kind of like your

298
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,019
banking account where you may have keys

299
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,180
to it you may have tokens you may have

300
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,899
it on a hardware token or whatnot right

301
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,300
a hardware wallet with more access

302
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,540
controls so if building a thing you

303
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,560
really have to take this into

304
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,600
consideration of who do you want to have

305
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,579
keys you want your admins to have the

306
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,920
same keys do you want your third parties

307
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
to do this so

308
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,399
you can kind of see how the threat

309
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,260
vectors are different right ones facing

310
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,640
the internet and the other one is

311
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
entirely should not be facing the

312
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,140
internet right it may be connected to a

313
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,060
third party and it's definitely

314
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,380
connected to your Insiders

315
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,339
this is probably one of my favorite

316
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,200
attacks because

317
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,140
it leverages an old school attack

318
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,820
um and and the kind of the use case

319
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,940
where this happened is

320
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,240
one of the crypto exchanges published a

321
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
SDK that had their

322
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,680
crypto address in it

323
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,120
and

324
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,660
somebody did a bgp hijack attack and

325
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,459
just replaced the crypto address in that

326
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,839
SDK

327
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,399
so guess where all the money started

328
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
going it started going to the Hacker's

329
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,079
wallet right and that was an amazing

330
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,180
attack because it had literally almost

331
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,279
nothing to do with crypto all they did

332
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,980
was an old school attack and the company

333
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,959
didn't realize or didn't even think that

334
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,060
they needed to have extra protections to

335
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,639
protect that they invested a lot in the

336
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,700
actual protection of how the application

337
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,459
was built and things but they didn't

338
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,200
consider that just publishing that

339
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,880
address was going to leave them at risk

340
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,339
um DDOS attacks a lot of these are

341
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,320
really the same things you would

342
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,700
normally think about but there's a

343
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,380
couple different things to consider you

344
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,079
know your login is normal right yeah I

345
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,839
want to I could get dosed and prevent

346
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,639
people from logging in

347
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,860
but pricing works very differently with

348
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
crypto right I know for instance I think

349
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,860
we pull pricing like every every 30

350
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,360
seconds or something of that nature

351
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,320
right so it's changing very often and if

352
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,839
you dos that pricing server well how

353
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
does the application respond then what

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,740
does it do is it going to give you the

355
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,660
last known one it did is it going to not

356
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,820
produce your purchase right in those

357
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,440
cases those are very interesting things

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,940
because you can game the system and

359
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,000
maybe able to come out ahead in that

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,560
if you can't talk to the blockchain

361
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
obviously you can

362
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,060
communicate so that's a big deal

363
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,380
we haven't talked about custody

364
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,899
providers but a lot of companies will

365
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,120
use the custody custody provider where

366
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,459
they interact with a blockchain on your

367
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,279
behalf so that eliminates a lot of the

368
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,420
risk

369
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,839
from what your interaction with the

370
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,519
blockchain and people faking

371
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,560
transactions or attacking the blockchain

372
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,600
however you can't communicate with a

373
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,420
blockchain or that third party then

374
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,600
um obviously your system is going to be

375
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,620
down

376
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,320
then anti-fraud is very interesting too

377
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,260
so this works where you have sanctions

378
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,860
busting or hackers or attackers that are

379
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,560
trying to pass fraudulent money and if

380
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,300
you can't do those checks well how does

381
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,680
your system going to respond is it not

382
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,120
going to process is it going to fail

383
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,700
open fail close so those are some

384
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,899
different areas that you have to

385
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,300
consider

386
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,060
so Insider threats like I said

387
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,540
cryptocurrencies irreversible so once

388
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,199
that money goes there's no oops no undo

389
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,279
right so a lot of attacks have been

390
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,220
Insider threats who have figured this

391
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,040
out there weren't good controls in place

392
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,959
just passed money and then disappeared

393
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,399
so

394
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,139
your Basics with MFA and least

395
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,000
privileged access but you need to think

396
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,920
about key charting keeping those keys

397
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,920
separate giving people only half access

398
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
to things or having them work with other

399
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,459
people right to make things happen again

400
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,260
logging is very important and on The

401
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,440
Insider threat area

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,380
fishing me easy it's

403
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,680
interesting story here is

404
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,740
so for instance we're PayPal

405
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,720
um yes we're doing cryptocurrency yes

406
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,699
I've seen cryptocurrency phishing emails

407
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,040
but if I fish somebody through a

408
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,740
cryptocurrency phishing email I just get

409
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,660
their credentials

410
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,660
and I can access their PayPal wallet it

411
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,620
doesn't matter if they're using

412
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,120
cryptocurrency or not I have their

413
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,880
PayPal credentials right so that's an

414
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,500
interesting thing that we've opened this

415
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,019
attack Vector where we're seeing more

416
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,940
attacks coming but it's giving access

417
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,980
just to their normal wallets not

418
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,959
specifically their cryptocurrency wallet

419
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,060
so that's something just to kind of

420
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,940
think about of what am I bringing in or

421
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,100
entailing just by adding cryptocurrency

422
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,459
in

423
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,120
oh blockchain so I I loved calling the

424
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,720
51 the hollywood-esque rate because to

425
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,579
pull this attack off you know if you

426
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,519
have 100 000 people in the blockchain

427
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,459
you need 51 000 of them to

428
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,740
kind of be on your side to pull over

429
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,899
this or adding 50 you know another 51

430
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,279
000 nodes or whatnot to pull off a

431
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,940
um 51 attack right in doing this you now

432
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,820
can do things like double spending or

433
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,199
rejecting transactions things like that

434
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:50,699
most of these attacks have happened on

435
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,180
smaller blockchains I haven't you know

436
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,040
there's always this growing worry of

437
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,079
someone like China coming in at a longer

438
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,940
larger blockchains and just having the

439
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,680
compute power to do this

440
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,260
but we necessarily haven't seen it

441
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,760
except on some of the smaller

442
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,459
blockchains I think the max one was like

443
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,980
18 million that was stolen through a 51

444
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,099
attack with I think Bitcoin gold

445
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,400
so that was pretty interesting that

446
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,220
these can happen but for instance this

447
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,079
kind of goes back to the mitigation of

448
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,939
for instance why we only support like

449
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,980
five coins we kind of assess that risk

450
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,939
and said

451
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,260
are we picking coins that the risk is

452
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,840
viable on this because of the size of

453
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,220
the network or do we feel comfortable

454
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,100
and safe so

455
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,220
uh smart contracts so smart contracts uh

456
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,500
basically are like little programs

457
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,840
in these transactions that are kind of

458
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,179
if then Clauses that says if this

459
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,860
happens or if this doesn't happens then

460
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,940
do this

461
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,160
uh some of the the fun attacks that

462
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,020
happen with these are essentially

463
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,299
bailing out of the transaction if these

464
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,200
if conditions aren't met so some of the

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
other exchanges will start to process it

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,860
and get so far and then something will

467
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,539
cause it to bail out but that exchange

468
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,059
will continue processing it now you kind

469
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,299
of have funds on both ends one of the

470
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,220
major considerations is if you use like

471
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,480
a crypto

472
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
a custody provider let's say

473
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,400
they handle every year they're basically

474
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,260
handing things over when everything's

475
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,539
finished with the blockchain so you

476
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,400
don't really see those smart contracts

477
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,620
affecting you as much because you're

478
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,080
already being handed the money and

479
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
you're not having to worry about

480
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,600
um

481
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,120
those impacting you

482
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,299
otherwise it's definitely definitely a

483
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,260
very

484
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,179
concerning thing if you are having to

485
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,160
deal with smart contracts and I would

486
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,660
recommend a lot of

487
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,539
good app Security on that end

488
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,640
I mentioned custody providers and you

489
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,080
know again custody provider somebody

490
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,520
interacts with the blockchain and

491
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,380
whatnot on your behalf

492
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,480
so a lot of the threats are mitigated

493
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,760
why with that you'll see a lot of

494
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
companies that do that on behalf just to

495
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,620
eliminate those threats so that's pretty

496
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,299
pretty safe and pretty exciting from

497
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,240
that perspective right

498
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,500
but you have to consider what if that

499
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,660
custody provider gets DDOS attacked

500
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,960
right what if there's Insider threats

501
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,179
from them coming into your network do

502
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,820
you have the appropriate two-factor with

503
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,220
them right and do they have more access

504
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,320
in their Network you know we talked

505
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,900
about those layers are they coming into

506
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,200
that lower that last layer right without

507
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,059
control so

508
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,640
and then is your software app Security

509
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,460
on those layers as good as it is on your

510
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,200
internet facing layers right where you

511
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,440
may have various software defects that

512
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,679
could allow those Insider

513
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,700
or third parties access

514
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,780
um now we'll move on to application

515
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,379
threats

516
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,880
so really a lot of it's just your

517
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,340
standard security apps that processes

518
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,980
right of Asian processes and making sure

519
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,740
that you're checking for things a lot of

520
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,600
the attacks that I researched and saw

521
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,780
was really validation of saying oh I

522
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,140
sent you 10 000 and really I'm sending

523
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,580
you a hundred thousand right or vice

524
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,039
versa right and the the code not being

525
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
smart enough to detect that these two

526
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,780
Fields weren't the same so in this case

527
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,940
I recommend a lot of that validation and

528
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,120
then revalidation of the server coming

529
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
back to the client and saying did you

530
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,000
really send this did you really mean

531
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,700
this right because a lot of the attacks

532
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,280
we see are trying to fake that sending

533
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
it one way so if you have that two-way

534
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,320
validation it really is a a good

535
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,059
mitigation

536
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,299
again about your anti-fraud right

537
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,460
um those anti-frauds are protecting you

538
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,100
against money laundering against us

539
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,679
ancient busting so make sure that you

540
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,360
don't have ways in your code that could

541
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,539
bypass that or you might have unchecked

542
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,419
transactions which could result in fines

543
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,020
and fees

544
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,400
so a new account fraud

545
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,179
um

546
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,460
right so fraudulent accounts are always

547
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,919
a problem like maybe companies

548
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,360
associated with a bluebird so but uh

549
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,220
you know in this case you really need

550
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,320
your controls to be kind of hardened to

551
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,640
identify I don't want a lot of people

552
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,919
creating fake accounts and trying to

553
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,400
push fraudulent account fraudulent

554
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,580
monies right there are kind of things in

555
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,980
place there's been a lot of talk about

556
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,960
in the in the industry about a company

557
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,880
by the name of chain analysis that can

558
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,280
kind of do this and the way they work is

559
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,620
they uh

560
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,559
they tie basically people the money and

561
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,200
say yes we know this was this uh

562
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,179
cryptocurrency transaction or account

563
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,940
was associated with a hack and then they

564
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,640
start to okay it forked off to these

565
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,559
other accounts let's flag those accounts

566
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,780
so as that money moves around it's a

567
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,580
database now that you can go check and

568
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,559
say no don't allow these transactions

569
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,840
because we know those are fraudulent or

570
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,940
associated with um

571
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,679
a hacked account or whatnot

572
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,340
um minting I haven't talked about

573
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,760
minting yet so one of the more common

574
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,679
attacks that I've seen this is specific

575
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,240
to crypto exchanges is in exchanges

576
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,039
where you're basically you take

577
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,140
transitioning one currency to the other

578
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,600
it's just your currency exchange right

579
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,340
so a lot of hackers uh and fraudsters

580
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,080
will use this to just kind of transfer

581
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,659
money over but these seem to be where

582
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,460
the most attacks are done like I said

583
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,740
one in three exchanges have been hacked

584
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,659
and this is because the way this attack

585
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,480
usually works is it says oh let me go

586
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,240
exchange like a you know 100 Bitcoin for

587
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,179
ethereum or whatnot or even less known

588
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,500
currency

589
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,299
and then as that transaction goes

590
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,880
through somehow you know through a

591
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,740
software defect or not they cancel the

592
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,940
transaction

593
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,580
however it still goes through on the

594
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,400
exchange and it refunds the money so you

595
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
just double double spend right you got

596
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,840
money on both ends uh that's how the

597
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
majority of these attacks seem to work

598
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,700
and the attackers just

599
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,440
pad their pockets so

600
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,539
um kyc controls know your customer so

601
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,880
there was interesting enough as I was

602
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,580
doing my threat model there was a very a

603
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,980
report came out at the same time

604
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,100
and kyc controls essentially are

605
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,380
checking like your ID as well as

606
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,000
checking liveness to make sure you're

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,280
alive kind of anti-bought controls and

608
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,500
making sure that you're not this report

609
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,260
basically said yes we can bypass them

610
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,080
right and how how that attack kind of

611
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
works right is you're submitting your ID

612
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,299
here and the problem is is there are so

613
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,220
many different IDs in the the world

614
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,740
right oh I'm using a passport from this

615
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,720
I'm using an ID from this I'm using an

616
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,200
ID from this state right how can this

617
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
system has to be able to consume them

618
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,220
all and then the liveness check it's

619
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,080
just checking to see hey is this a live

620
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,299
person and not a bot but the problem

621
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,799
with this is there's really no

622
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,260
correlation between those two of saying

623
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,900
is a person on the liveness check

624
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,059
the person in the ID

625
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,679
if you think about that it's a really

626
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,900
hard problem to even consider just with

627
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,179
how things are like what if it's a man

628
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,799
and a woman right

629
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,960
um

630
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,120
maybe it's what if I have a beard and

631
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,740
now I don't have a beard right how do

632
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,840
you account for that so there are a lot

633
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,360
of uh things that the software can't

634
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,580
account for in that so I think that's an

635
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,059
area that is still in the industry being

636
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,260
fine-tuned to kind of solve for

637
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,179
um I mentioned I actually talked about

638
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,659
crypto exchange attacks in the other

639
00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:00,000
slide so attackers kind of flock here

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,820
because of this right for that

641
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,780
um

642
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,840
it's not much else to talk about

643
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,000
minting I kind of mentioned minting is

644
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,820
when you're creating new currency so a

645
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,440
lot of this happens for stable coins

646
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
right where hey I'm exchanging so much

647
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,940
Bitcoin or so much cash and creating

648
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,340
minting new money in the crypto market

649
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,480
so a lot of these attacks are

650
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
the same kind of the same thing if you

651
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,500
can trick in here you're creating

652
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,360
digital currency you're hacking through

653
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,740
a computer now right uh and and it is

654
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,900
actually rather easy to do that if

655
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,400
you've seen the the slide I went through

656
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,740
a couple back right with the amount of

657
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,600
times this has been done

658
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,360
but by using a custody provider again

659
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
even with stablecoin you're transferring

660
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,380
all that liability over to them and

661
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,299
you're insuring it so this really kind

662
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,820
of helps you and our case helped us from

663
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,799
not having to worry about that and

664
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,460
making sure that liability is covered

665
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,380
I spoke about kind of money laundering

666
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,140
sanction busting right mad actors you

667
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,460
leverage this all the time there's

668
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,020
something called kind of peel chaining

669
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,760
where they're going to make very small

670
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,440
transactions and they're also going to

671
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,480
try to do race conditions where they're

672
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,240
going to open so so many addresses so

673
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,720
fast that the system can't keep up with

674
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,059
this but you have to build in some

675
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,559
delays to make sure that you're

676
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,419
accounting for those checks even with

677
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,000
those limits right I think on the next

678
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,480
slide I'll talk about trust or yes

679
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,760
so this is something coinbase has been

680
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,679
driven uh driving there's something

681
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,740
called the travel rule in financials and

682
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,360
that's essentially saying with certain

683
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,700
limits of money you have to transfer

684
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,100
some basic pii information over with

685
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,380
that money right and this is assuring

686
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,400
that again those anti-money laundering

687
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,039
into ancient busting things aren't being

688
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,080
abused so

689
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,700
basically you're you're saying oh yes

690
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,480
this I know this person it's this person

691
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,559
transferring this amount of money right

692
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,779
is very minimal information but it goes

693
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,179
to that financial institution so that

694
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,340
way both the sender receiver have that

695
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,679
fair same amount of information and they

696
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,840
can go perform that check and give it a

697
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,179
thumbs up or thumbs down if it's good

698
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,720
uh so there is a regulation that happens

699
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,460
with fiat currency with your normal

700
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,820
money that for this to happen but

701
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,260
cryptocurrency being so new there wasn't

702
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,500
now that rule is actually I believe

703
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,720
still supposed to be enforced but like

704
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,779
the SEC and things have not been

705
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,179
enforcing that because cryptocurrency is

706
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,720
so so new so coinbase was trying to kind

707
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,279
of get ahead of the game and saying we

708
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,779
need to kind of come up with a solution

709
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,179
to do this because blockchain and

710
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,220
cryptocurrency doesn't account or allow

711
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,320
for this so they put together this and

712
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,659
now there's 30 plus companies I think

713
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,000
that contribute and work together to

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,159
kind of make this happen so that's kind

715
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,799
of an interesting story and some behind

716
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,659
the scenes things of how things happen

717
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,840
that um I wasn't necessarily aware of or

718
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,799
informed about before

719
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,360
and uh this is really just kind of wrap

720
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,100
up so kind of through the threat

721
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,760
modeling when I came out with this right

722
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,159
um and sat with a team went through all

723
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,080
of this they were really kind of

724
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,179
impressed from the perspective of wow

725
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,500
you really did your homework you came

726
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,480
back with these meaningful results of

727
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,039
where we need to focus on where we need

728
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,620
to prioritize on and this is where we

729
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,480
need to invest our money on and take our

730
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,900
Tech debt and kind of do this right

731
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,220
similarly everyone in security was like

732
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,260
okay now I understand where our

733
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,299
strengths and weaknesses are where we

734
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,419
have crypto smes and where we don't or

735
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,279
maybe we need to do additional crypto

736
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,020
specific testing and maybe we don't

737
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,240
right this is really kind of was an

738
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,799
eye-opener to

739
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,039
the whole product right of where we need

740
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,679
to focus on as a threat modeler

741
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,299
establishing all those relationships

742
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,159
it's kind of a long going thing right

743
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,679
now I found that oh yes these features

744
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,000
are coming out they're coming to me

745
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
saying I want you to work on this I want

746
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,100
you to focus on this right uh so get

747
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,000
engaged early right as I mentioned try

748
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
to move your program down to getting

749
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
engaged sharing the design and

750
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,760
development phase you're going to build

751
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
these relationships you're going to be

752
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,340
thankful because they're going to

753
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,740
understand the ROI

754
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,720
um because if you come to them so many

755
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,580
times with more Tech debt they're going

756
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,140
to get frustrated but if you start to

757
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,000
turn that around and saying this is why

758
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
they start to understand and say okay

759
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
developers might be cranky because

760
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,460
they're just trying to print out code

761
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,220
but believe me the leadership and the

762
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,419
project managers and the product

763
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,880
managers all well be thankful and

764
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,740
understand

765
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,080
the the real the challenge you know as I

766
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,220
mentioned

767
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,620
is kind of measuring that Roi what was

768
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,659
influenced what was change how can I put

769
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,640
a dollar value on that that's something

770
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm constantly tweaking and trying to

771
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,200
come up with if I can say hey I saved

772
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,140
one five ten vulnerabilities you know I

773
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,820
can kind of work backwards and say well

774
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,380
this is how much each of those phase

775
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,659
costs once I start to show them that

776
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,940
number everyone gets really excited

777
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,159
because they're like wow we know that

778
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,260
was a positive thing we know where that

779
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,320
came from so

780
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,940
um that's all I had I think there's

781
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,559
plenty of time for questions if anyone

782
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,670
has any but thanks so much

783
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:29,609
[Applause]
