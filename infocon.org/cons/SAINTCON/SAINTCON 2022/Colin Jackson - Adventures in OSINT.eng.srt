1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,319
all right

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to my talk

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,120
Friday morning last day of the con

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,099
everyone's probably kind of tired and

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,740
everything and you know home stretch

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,360
we're almost a closing ceremony so

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,700
appreciate you for coming

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,279
so I'm Colin Jackson I go by didymus

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
it's a dorky handle but I picked it so

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,260
there you go and we're going to be

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,060
talking about oscent calls this

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,100
adventures in the ocean I'm gonna we're

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,439
just gonna dip our toe into this I'm not

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,939
going to talk about all the tools I'm

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:30,960
not going to talk about all the

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,220
different techniques or anything like

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,899
that I'm just going to kind of give you

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,940
a taste because I truly think everyone

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,800
should learn osin because it's really

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,020
cool I think it's a useful skill

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,399
regardless of what field you're in

22
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,120
security non-security you know not even

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,500
if you're not in Tech I think it's a

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,700
great skill

25
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,840
so let's talk about this

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,360
so I always like to put up an agenda so

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800
you know you know where we're going with

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,760
this and if you're watching the

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,079
recording you're like okay I can fast

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,300
forward pass this or whatever

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,280
um so yeah I thought of Adventures in no

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
sense because I wanted to tell a couple

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,180
stories that I've had where I use docent

34
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,640
for good and that's going to be kind of

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
a theme like use osin but make sure

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,240
you're using it for good reasons and

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
we're going to talk about ethics and

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,260
like not doxing everything oh man people

39
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,060
just got tired I just said ethics and

40
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,460
everyone was like

41
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm sorry hopefully this is a little fun

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,299
hopefully this is a little engaging it's

43
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,400
not going to get super technical but

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,140
yeah also has anyone ever seen this

45
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,420
movie Adventures in Babysitting I

46
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,799
watched it I had a huge crush on

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,000
Elizabeth Shoe when I was a little kid

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,460
so yeah that's why that's there so

49
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,680
okay

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,439
man this Talk's going off the rails fast

51
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,960
all right Colin Jackson

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
um I'm a senior security engineer I've

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,220
been doing security like I guess

54
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,040
Security in my title for like 10 years I

55
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,420
argue I've been doing it a bit longer

56
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,799
than that but

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,500
mostly incident response I'm a Sim guy

58
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,720
do a lot of stuff splunk's kind of my

59
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,020
main sim a lot of blue team I'm a

60
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,820
pluralsight author so if any of your

61
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,920
pluralsight subscribers watch my course

62
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,080
okay Shameless

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,700
um lock picking was what got me into

64
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
security originally uh I got into it

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
when I was in college I thought it was

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,739
really cool and then from there they're

67
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,300
like you know physical security is this

68
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,340
one little part of the whole vast

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,260
information cyber security thing you

70
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,940
should do that because this internet

71
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,620
thing is going to take off okay I'm not

72
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
that old but you know internet's gonna

73
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,620
take off

74
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,819
I like I was saying I like to do

75
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,040
obstacle races I box boxing is kind of

76
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
fun it's a good stress reliever for me

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,040
family stuff like that also I use memes

78
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,560
a lot as a defense mechanism and also to

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,660
help combat my imposter syndrome so

80
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,580
you're in luck we're going to have memes

81
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,900
throughout this

82
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,540
also this is the most important part I'm

83
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,400
not a lawyer and I give horrible advice

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,660
so

85
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,480
you've been warned

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
all right

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,019
so let's start out with what is ocean a

88
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,620
really fun definition in pretty basic

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,319
um it's publicly available information

90
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,640
that you can get

91
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,319
um you know from the Internet or other

92
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,180
places and oscent is essentially a

93
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,920
digital footprint Left Behind from

94
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,260
someone's online activity presence

95
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,599
things like that this information is

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,739
open and readily available

97
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,500
Friday shut it readily available

98
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,959
um usually you can get it

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,519
um without an account sometimes you can

100
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,900
get it with sign up for a free account

101
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,459
or a burner account and then you get

102
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,260
access to the information kind of good

103
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,580
so a more accurate definition

104
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,560
open source intelligence is like sigan

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
but for nerds on the internet who don't

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,159
know what Signet means

107
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,180
most

108
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,099
analysts including myself not me I'm

109
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,060
quoting

110
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,120
live on a diet of pizza and censored

111
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,159
also I got this from Urban Dictionary so

112
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,659
both of those definitions refer from

113
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,299
Urban Dictionary so there you go

114
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,239
I was teaching ocean one time internally

115
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,400
at like a kind of like a lunch and learn

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,220
thing within my company and one of my

117
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,620
friends one of my co-workers friends she

118
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,900
said okay so that's open source

119
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,519
intelligence what's closed Source

120
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,939
intelligence like oh that's easy theft

121
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,480
corporate corporate Espionage you know

122
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,100
anything marked internal do not share

123
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,600
that kind of yeah that's closed Source

124
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,459
intelligence that's illegal

125
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,919
don't do it you know whatever

126
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,540
so occasionally they're like well what's

127
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,180
closed Source there you go

128
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,560
okay

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,380
here's the ethics slide so oscent is not

130
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,840
doxing you can use osin to dox people

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
but doxxine is where you like leak

132
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,759
personal information about someone just

133
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,639
to be a jerk just to be a big Dirtbag

134
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,740
kind of a thing and the whole intent is

135
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,720
like hey this is where this person lives

136
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
this is their home address this is you

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,120
know let's let's go you know it can it

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,979
can be pretty bad they get bullied they

139
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,780
can get swatted does everyone know what

140
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,919
swatted is

141
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,080
that's where you're calling a fake SWAT

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
9-1-1 and they go and like attack the

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,100
house thinking it's a SWAT situation

144
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,620
it's really dirt baggy so

145
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,020
doxing don't do it it's bad and it's

146
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,198
stupid

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,300
okay but why oh sent why should I learn

148
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,180
ocean what you know so let's talk a bit

149
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,600
about that

150
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,680
um so like I was saying earlier oscent

151
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
is open source information a lot of it

152
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,940
is free on like you can find it if you

153
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,500
know where to look on the internet and

154
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,360
some like people search websites or

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
things like that it's like hey sign up

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
for a free account and you can search

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,699
and get access to some of the data or

158
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,520
like a limited section of the data or

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,340
you can do X number of searches per week

160
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
or month or something sign up for a free

161
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,919
account with a burner email there you go

162
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,960
um I argue that it's very useful for red

163
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,600
teamers so you'll you listen to like the

164
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,160
keynote with Jason Street where he talks

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,479
about you know doing some ocean doing

166
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,039
some reconnaissance learning more about

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,500
my company my target where is their

168
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,479
company located what information is out

169
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,580
on the internet that kind of stuff so

170
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,620
red teamers use ocean all the time I

171
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,060
argue the blue teamers can use it too

172
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,400
because if someone's going to attack

173
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,020
your company your organization they're

174
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,759
going to be doing osent they're going to

175
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,780
be looking at what's publicly available

176
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,419
as a blue team or as a Defender I want

177
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,259
to know what they're going to be looking

178
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,240
at so I need to know the skills you know

179
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,340
you can you can argue this with every

180
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,979
red team skill but blue teamers need to

181
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,300
have these skills too because they need

182
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,680
to know how they're going to be attacked

183
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,720
so that they can defend it we're going

184
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,940
to talk a little about a bit about that

185
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,800
private investigators investigators

186
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,380
privacy enthusiasts if you're a privacy

187
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,000
conscious person and you don't want

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,300
information about you

189
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,520
you can find it and there's even ways

190
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,139
you can opt out I'm going to cover that

191
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,060
a little bit as well so

192
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,759
there you go legal and compliance types

193
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,100
press some people who work in the Press

194
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,840
if they know osense skills like how they

195
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,060
can find out information or things like

196
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,520
that or you know ocean is everyone

197
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,500
should know osin okay if I beat the dead

198
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,340
horse

199
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,720
because there's two more bullets and I'm

200
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,639
going to keep going anyway

201
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,160
okay you'll be more effective at Google

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,900
Dorking we'll be talking about that if

203
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
you don't know what Google Dorking is

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
uh finding people protecting yourself

205
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,300
and loved ones and this is my favorite

206
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,220
one you can actually save lives through

207
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,080
osend and I'm not kidding you really can

208
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,940
and I'm going to talk about that cool

209
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,680
experience we got to do at Defcon this

210
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
year

211
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,220
so oscent tools these are like

212
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,900
categories these aren't all the

213
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,580
categories these are just some that I'm

214
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,080
going to talk about and I'm going to

215
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,580
talk about some of the tools but like I

216
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,080
said we're just dipping our toe in this

217
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,880
we're just like wetting your appetites

218
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,380
for oh sent

219
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,360
so big one is people search websites

220
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,919
there's tons of them out there they're

221
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,860
data Brokers anytime you signed up for

222
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,419
you know when you sign up for a service

223
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,979
like hey here's the terms and conditions

224
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,300
in blah blah blah and you search and

225
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,099
you're like can share information with

226
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,599
third parties yeah these are the third

227
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,599
parties that buy that data and anonymize

228
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,520
it by changing your name to a good and

229
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,199
then you know then they can build a

230
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,000
profile think of the Cambridge analytica

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,340
Cambridge analytica hack that happened a

232
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,220
few years ago and that kind of stuff

233
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,880
um

234
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,860
you could look that up you should you

235
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,259
should duck it sorry DuckDuckGo it I

236
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,500
don't say Google it you should duck it

237
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,479
um social media there is a lot of stuff

238
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,400
on social media I'm not a huge fan of it

239
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,080
I don't have much social media I have a

240
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,419
Twitter and I have LinkedIn and then I

241
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,580
have burner accounts that I use for oh

242
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,699
sent reasons not even tied to me

243
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,080
yeah

244
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,539
uh company information this you can get

245
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,879
information like leadership

246
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
um filing papers if they're a publicly

247
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
traded company a lot of that information

248
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,458
is publicly available there's things

249
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,860
like Zoom info and Dunn and Bradstreet

250
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,599
and these business directories so like

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,919
if you're in sales and you want to know

252
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,059
more about a company you're trying to

253
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,760
sell sell to you can do that

254
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,399
uh vulnerabilities or Technologies used

255
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,200
so this is like

256
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,519
um kind of more on the red team or

257
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,800
reconnaissance phase but there's

258
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,380
companies there's like websites that can

259
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,540
scan IPS and scan companies and like

260
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,220
build up a little profile on it so like

261
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,800
things like bit site security scorecard

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
risk Recon it's like hey we're going to

263
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
publicly shame these people look at

264
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
their horrible security credit score and

265
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
then you're trying to sell a product and

266
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,140
like hey we looked you up on this

267
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,700
security credit score and you guys have

268
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,220
a b that's kind of embarrassing and it's

269
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,140
it's kind of like they blackmail you

270
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,880
it's I don't like those

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
has anyone experienced that with those

272
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,860
kind of yeah yeah you did okay

273
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,720
Olson framework I love this one because

274
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,779
it's got so much stuff on it

275
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,620
ellisonframework.com it looks just like

276
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,540
this and as you click on each of these

277
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,459
it'll actually expand and there is a ton

278
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,680
I realize this is really small I only

279
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
expanded a few things but it kind of

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,700
goes on basic categories possible

281
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,440
subcategories and then it links out to

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
the sites it it's pretty well maintained

283
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,940
it's it's free it's open some of the

284
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,980
links are broken now or like sometimes

285
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,300
when they realize people can use this

286
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,620
free service they might throw up a

287
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,600
paywall or a login Windows kind of thing

288
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,820
but ocean framework it's really fun it's

289
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
got lots of stuff

290
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,880
foreign

291
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,800
okay so this is some of the things that

292
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm going to cover today again we're not

293
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,160
gonna this is not gonna be a workshop

294
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,260
you could spend a whole week learning on

295
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,899
osin and just barely scratch the surface

296
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,040
you can talk about people searching

297
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
social media so actual people kind of

298
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,060
focused osin I'm going to talk about

299
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,500

300
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,420

302
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,600
video that kind of media

303
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760

kitties like me so

305
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,200

306
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,459

um Intelius I might have spelled that

315
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,480
wrong

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440

like that these are like these can all

320
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,140
be used together to build a profile and

321
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,420
research and look up on people um real

322

time at my vacation is like oh cool you

333
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,279
live in Provo you're anyone can see this

334
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,420
because you didn't lock down your

335
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,279
profile anyone can view it I wonder if

336
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,360
your house is going to get robbed that's

337
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,440
cool

338
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
things like that think about

339
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,120
you know don't over share it's bad and

340
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,700
then also username searches so this is a

341
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,399
kind of a close-up of ocent framework

342
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,200
just on the username there's a bunch of

343
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,040
different

344
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,660
places where you can actually search

345
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,579
usernames because sometimes if you just

346
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,320
have a username it's like can I tie this

347
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,420
can I do some research see if I can find

348
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,200
who what email or email addresses that's

349
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,839
tied to or anything get a person's name

350
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,480
that way sometimes when they do like

351
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,740
police investigations and they're like

352
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,260
hey this username is cyber bullying

353
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,300
harassing this person they'll launch

354
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,640
investigative things for like hey we

355
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
have a username to go off of let's track

356
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,760
this down see if we can tie it to a

357
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,000
person get an IP you know look up that

358
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,120
IP or file a warrant find out who's

359
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,740
connected that kind of stuff so there's

360
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,360
things like that

361
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,320
so here I am Doxie myself but so I just

362
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,880
searched up didymus and there's a couple

363
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,779
things

364
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,240
there let me just

365
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,740
ban that a little because I can't see it

366
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,959
so yeah I'm on keybase

367
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,300
um I I must have signed up on medium one

368
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,760
time to actually read medium so

369
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,980
and my hacker One account cool that's

370
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,959
there I get that

371
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,579
and then there's some that are like this

372
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,500
it's like hey just throw in a username

373
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,820
and we're going to just do a quick check

374
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,560
and this must be API calls where it's

375
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,760
like hey I want to create a new account

376
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,740
it's like oh that one's taken return yes

377
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,560
no kind of a thing so and yeah there's

378
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,839
my Twitter there's some that I don't

379
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,660
have like datamis.org that's not me I

380
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,700
don't have that Foursquare definitely

381
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,200
not me but it's kind of interesting how

382
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,300
you can sort of do that

383
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,740
um I don't use that name on Reddit

384
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,600
that's not me but

385
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,160
creepy right

386
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,620
it's kind of good to kind of look up

387
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,820
yourself see what kind of stuff is out

388
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,740
there

389
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,320
all right two really good sites again

390
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,760
there are several but there's two very

391
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,860
good ones that are open source that are

392
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
open

393
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,959
um showdan you can you can like search

394
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,500
just about anything like IP address

395
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,139
domains you can look up like there are

396
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,639
things constantly scanning so look up

397
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,740
like company.com your company and it's

398
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,600
like hey you know a scanned at this time

399
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,339
here are the ports that were open here's

400
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,440
the protocols we detected

401
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,660
um here's the IP location Geo locations

402
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,579
where they were coming from or what

403
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,079
cloud provider they're using and stuff

404
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,760
showdown's really interesting and you

405
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,079
can find all sorts of stuff you can find

406
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,440
open webcams you can find like

407
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,680
now gobs and gobs of stuff really

408
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,600
maltego is a similar one I'm not going

409
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,880
to demo either of these but maltigo I

410
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,100
think you just have to sign up and you

411
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,720
can basically take an IP address a

412
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
domain of something and it'll kind of do

413
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
like this little spidering thing seeing

414
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,940
all the other things that's connected to

415
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,860
it's like hey it's hosted here here's

416
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,540
other websites that are hosted here so

417
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,700
if you're doing like company Recon it's

418
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,000
like oh so here's company.com but here's

419
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,620
a bunch of other domains that are also

420
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,019
owned by company.com you can spider it's

421
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,120
kind of like it's like a web you can

422
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,260
start really building out a big

423
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,600
um information about those things uh

424
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,220
Showdown you can do

425
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,220
a handful of free searches I think you

426
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,660
can also sign up for an account on Black

427
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,040
Friday they have lifetime memberships

428
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
it's like five bucks for a lifetime

429
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,920
membership and I think you can do like a

430
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,740
thousand searches a day API calls a day

431
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,540
so relatively inexpensive kind of fun

432
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,000
okay

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
corporate Recon so I mentioned Google

434
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,860
hacking Google Dorking this it's not

435
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,139
really hacking you're using Google key

436
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,500
phrases to return very specific results

437
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,959
and there's a bunch of information out

438
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,060
there just look up Google hacking Google

439
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,240
Dorking cheat sheets I put two there

440
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,300
and basically you can use that to narrow

441
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,920
down your search results again I only

442
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,600
use Google when I'm actually Google

443
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
Dorking

444
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,779
but the couple of ones that I use quite

445
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,779
a bit site so site colon and then no

446
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,339
space you type in the domain it'll only

447
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,740
return search results of that domain

448
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,139
similar within URL so if you know

449
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,480
there's like a certain phrase or like an

450
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,279
ID number or something you're like hey

451
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,339
show me everywhere this this shows up in

452
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,959
a URL and it will only return those

453
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,459
search results there's a bunch of

454
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,620
different keywords but these are some of

455
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,500
the ones that I use often file type this

456
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,620
is a cool one so you can do file type

457
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,440
colon PDF and it'll only return PDFs or

458
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,060
XLS or you know anything like that

459
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,160
so they will only Show links that link

460
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,660
to actual files that are publicly

461
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,940
available on the internet related is a

462
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,959
fun one

463
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,360
so this isn't so much ocean this is just

464
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
fun to do so let's say you find a really

465
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,019
cool website and you like it a lot like

466
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,360
I don't know syncon saintcon.org it's

467
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
like I want to see other websites that

468
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,079
are similar to that or like even like

469
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,940
competitors or whatever you can do

470
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,660
related colon

471
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,740
syncon.com.org or whatever and it'll

472
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,800
return other like related like things

473
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,920
like Defcon torcon formerly Derby con

474
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,440
stuff yeah I know so the related field

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
is kind of fun

476
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,940
so yeah site URL

477
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,660
um oh Dash site URL or maybe it's just

478
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Dash domain name it's like hey let's say

479
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,740
I'm doing

480
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,920
doing reconnaissance on company.com but

481
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,300
I don't want to get results from

482
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,399
company.com I can do Dash company.com

483
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,259
and then type in company.com so it's

484
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,820
like hey show me what everyone else is

485
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,320
saying I don't want to see their website

486
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,940
I want to see websites that link to that

487
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,820
websites that reference it refer links

488
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,680
things like that

489
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,139
this is something I used to you use back

490
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,540
in college it still works but you know

491
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,880
index of Apache web servers if you don't

492
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,040
properly protect your directory Pages

493
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,160
you can type in index of and then band

494
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,140
group audiobook whatever MP3 and then

495
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,500
exclude ASP PHP HTML and you'll find

496
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,020
like basically file servers with stuff

497
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,020
so let's say your favorite band is

498
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,599
Nickelback yes great great example so

499
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,160
index of Nickelback MP3 and then Dash

500
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,900
says you know exclude these and it'll

501
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,440
list all of these index of pages where

502
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,299
the actual file is stored and on the

503
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,960
Apache servers with Nickelback MP3s this

504
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,140
is like Poor Man's Napster I don't know

505
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,000
don't do this don't steal things but you

506
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,679
know whatever anyway that's something

507
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,299
back in the day statute of limitations I

508
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,240
stopped I deleted it all okay

509
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
Max

510
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,679
gosh so um two cheat sheets I think

511
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,780
those URLs still work if not you can

512
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,820
just Google that and then I'd encourage

513
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,559
all of you if you work for a company or

514
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,600
organization look up and see what kind

515
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
of stuff is already out there that maybe

516
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,780
shouldn't be out there and report it

517
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,880
internally or get it down like

518
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,039
so my company show me all the PDFs if

519
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,260
the word confidential or internals in it

520
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,960
and I can find it on Google hackers can

521
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
find it or like go look for like file

522
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,039
type

523
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,919
I don't know xlsx

524
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,200
um salary information see if you can

525
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,600
find someone who like exported like

526
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,520
you know a spreadsheet full of salary

527
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,860
information I don't know so this is the

528
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,240
kind of stuff the blue teamers should do

529
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,559
this is what hackers are going to do you

530
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,000
should do it too and then take it off

531
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,860
and then you can also submit to like

532
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,419
Google or whatnot and say hey remove

533
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,980
these results we don't want them you can

534
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,360
do that kind of stuff

535
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,100
is this useful we're going to do a quick

536
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
pulse check is this information that

537
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,160
yay I got thumbs cool thanks

538
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,900
ah

539
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,580
corporate Recon okay a few other things

540
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,919
the Wayback machine this is the internet

541
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,740
archive web.archive.org so this is great

542
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,840
if you want to see what websites used to

543
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,640
look like this basically scans the

544
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,440
internet and takes snapshots of websites

545
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,260
so like if website suddenly goes down

546
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,240
you're like oh no that had a link to

547
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,100
something or what happened to this

548
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
company you can go back in time and see

549
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,700
what the website used to look like and a

550
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,740
lot of times the links will work if they

551
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,740
indexed the page that it was linking to

552
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,020
so that's kind of fun so here's Saint

553
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,400
Khan back in uh let's see September

554
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,820
2013. sorry remember when we sold out

555
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,280
with 1500 seats look at that back then

556
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,740
it was only 300 seats available this is

557
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,380
up at Weaver but isn't that crazy so you

558
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,419
can go back look at the different stuff

559
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,340
I have a story about this later

560
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,460
not this site but using Wayback machine

561
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,820
Corporate social media accounts I

562
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,460
hate marketing

563
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,260
that's not a popular opinion I don't

564
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,700
like marketing I don't like it when like

565
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,860
they're like the social media manager is

566
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,539
like posting like hey look who just

567
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,100
started the job at this company and they

568
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,960

569
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,700

570
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,260

571
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,240

574
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,179
kind of freaks me out I'm okay it's like

575
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,740
hey I got a new job at company but it's

576
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,419

577
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,700

social they're going to be looking at

589
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,179
stuff they're going to be trying to get

590
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,400

600
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,299
can see people there connected to and

601
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,640
stuff so you can kind of Recon so

602
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,880

606
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,660
company it's yeah

607
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,820
corporate hashtags are kind of fun

608
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,740
so there was a talk back in 2015 at

609
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,720
b-sides by Adam Steed and I really liked

610
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,360
it but he talked about basically using

611
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
LinkedIn to get all this information

612
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,140
this is kind of hard to see

613
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,940
also this back from 2015 but it's like

614
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,880
from job postings and Linkedin

615
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,220
um profiles you can see what kind of

616
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,960
stuff they're doing so this is a little

617
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,179
bit hard to read because it's like what

618
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,039
almost almost 10 years ago but it's like

619
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,220
hey active directory exchange I love it

620
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,720
when they list the exact version they're

621
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,780
using like Palo Alto this Cisco this in

622
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,520
their LinkedIn bio it's like oh I know

623
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,500
exactly what exploits I need to try on

624
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,360
that corporate Network

625
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,940
don't overshare

626
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,500
I hope there's a few good nuggets you

627
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,120
can take like some good one-liners you

628
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,580
can take back anyway

629
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,860
other things uh domain tools you can see

630
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,080
who domains are registered sometimes if

631
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
they don't register them through like a

632
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,340
privacy like a lot of domain registrars

633
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,500
now will like hide who the registrar is

634
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,880
but sometimes it's still like hey this

635
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,100
is registered by Bob this is his home

636
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,380
address this is his phone number

637
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,659
and this is publicly available because

638
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,480
domain information is publicly available

639
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,419
domain tools MX toolbox is great you can

640
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,220
see stuff like MX records like oh

641
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,580
they're using Office 365 here good to

642
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,080
know how I need to craft my phishing

643
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
emails or oh they're using Google Google

644
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,820
workspaces G Suite Google whatever

645
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,700
so there's that kind of information

646
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,159
I mentioned corporate hashtags sometimes

647
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,419
they'll do like internal things like Hey

648
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,000
we're trying to you know make sure you

649
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
use the uh you know

650
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,720
corporate hashtags are like when people

651
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,480
went um remote during kova during the

652
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
pandemics like hey you know let you know

653
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,620
we're all working at home we're all in

654
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,720
this together let's do some hashtag desk

655
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,159
launch and they're taking pictures of

656
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,700
that so careful I I wouldn't participate

657
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,020
in this but it's like hey look at this

658
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,260
here's the Wi-Fi password SSID

659
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,059
you know and this one up here I think it

660
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,740
was what was it the launch codes or

661
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,120
something in the Hawaii or something

662
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,059
like that or yeah that's that's great

663
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,679
also don't take pictures of your

664
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,480
corporate badges because that's another

665
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,860
thing that if they're going to get on

666
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,679
site like pen testers or malicious

667
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,299
actors they're going to want to see your

668
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,460
actual badge make a copy of it so they

669
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,179
look more legit

670
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,100
so there you go

671
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,840
have we beaten the don't over share dead

672
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,640
horse because we can keep beating it if

673
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,980
okay

674
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,840
um so this is a technology-based company

675
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,559
here in Utah just

676
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,720
you know the the one on the top left

677
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,580
looks pretty Innocent but it's like okay

678
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,620
well they obviously use max that's

679
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,539
interesting you know what information

680
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,280
can I glean from this can I zoom in on

681
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,320
that notebook and is there are they

682
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,640
using an actual notebook or did they

683
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,919
make some demo prop sort of thing and

684
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,260
then on the other side it's like well I

685
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,640
can see what kind of IDE they're working

686
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,559
on and different stuff like that I

687
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,760
probably shouldn't share this but anyway

688
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,620
there you go

689
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,480
wiggle I have heard people call it

690
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,980
Weigel but I like to say wiggle

691
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,440
wiggle.net so this is interesting

692
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,960
because you can download this and

693
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,059
basically you can War Drive and map all

694
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,740
these Wi-Fi networks all over the world

695
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,799
you know think Wi-Fi Cactus Wi-Fi crack

696
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,260
anything Dark Matter does

697
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,600
um yeah uploading stuff to wiggle what's

698
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,280
cool is this is one of the ones where

699
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,840
you sign up for a free account and you

700
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,580
can search so I signed up and I searched

701
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,559
for Saint con and then I get all these

702
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,539
little purple dots where someone was

703
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,820
wiggling that sounds dumb where someone

704
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,159
was wiggling and picked up oh here's

705
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,860
this SSID named sync on sure enough here

706
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,120
we are at the Utah Valley Convention

707
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,820
Center and it picked up like 20 or so

708
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,460
and it goes off your phone GPS and you

709
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,919
know so when you see like

710
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,440
people posting videos and they like open

711
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,820
their Network trays like okay now I'm

712
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,080
going to connect to my Wi-Fi and it

713
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,600
lists all the Wi-Fi's listed it's like

714
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
oh I can wiggle the names of those

715
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,039
Wi-Fi's and I can geolocate right where

716
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,720
they are

717
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,940
your creep meter should be going into

718
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,159
the red about now that's what I'm going

719
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,140
for here we said Adventures I should

720
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,260
have said disadventures and innocent

721
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,059
corporate Recon okay

722
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,580
doing okay on time the Harvester this is

723
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,220
a fun command line tool works on Linux

724
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,440
basically you can put in the domain and

725
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,580
say hey I want to search all these

726
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,140
different sites for anything tied to

727
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,240
that domain and it's it's come a long

728
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,700
way you can actually get API keys and

729
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,740
load that into the config file of

730
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,120
harvester and then it'll go through and

731
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,900
search through all those different

732
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,659
things Zoom info done in Bradstreet I

733
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,679
kind of talked about these These are

734
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
business directories uh done in

735
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,980
Bradstreet that's that's kind of like

736
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,299
where you're filling out online forms

737
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,799
like what's your company name you type

738
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,900
in company.com it's like Oh and it auto

739
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,179
populates like you know okay located

740
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,919
here this is your address like oh yeah

741
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,600
that's the one you click and auto fills

742
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,820
the rest that convenience is because

743
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,440
they're pulling from a corporate

744
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,659
database of everyone's company

745
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,080
information that's creepy creep meter

746
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,700
we're all yeah

747
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,740
also you can kind of use it as a reverse

748
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,720
or a blind SQL query which is kind of

749
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,919
creepy

750
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,500
okay this is a little video it might

751
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,539
take a minute I was just running this

752
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,520
the other night this is on a

753
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,260
burner laptop I have so I'm just hitting

754
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,120
up Utah saint.org so that's the

755
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,400
organization behind sankcon

756
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,140
and you'll notice getting a few errors

757
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,000
here back in the day they only used to

758
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,520
have like five search engines or places

759
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,140
they would search

760
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,120
and now they have a whole bunch

761
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
it's going to go through and it's

762
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
basically just doing this automated I

763
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
think it's a python script it's going

764
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,659
through a python script it's taking in

765
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:43,860
the domain name and it's going to be

766
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,900
searching for anything that has that

767
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,260
domain in it what's nice is you can get

768
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,980
um

769
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,880
you can get URLs IP addresses where

770
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,559
they're originating from you can get

771
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,179
emails so if you're doing corporate

772
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,279
Recon you want to get or or if you're

773
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,080
doing phishing you're like hey let's get

774
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,240
a fishing list let's see what people's

775
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,640
emails are listed online

776
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,140
um Google's gotten a little smart

777
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,520
Google's one of the ones on this and

778
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
you're going to see the error here in a

779
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,440
minute

780
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,700
but

781
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Google will detect

782
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,340
it's probably the user agent but it will

783
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,500
detect if you're using the Harvester

784
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,240
it's like hey you're doing like

785
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,340
a hundred of searches really quick

786
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,960
against this domain we're going to kind

787
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,799
of

788
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,419
kind of throttle you a little bit let me

789
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,820
see if I can forward it but

790
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,980
find it a little bit

791
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,919
searching Google 200 results

792
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,900
so yeah Google is blocking your IP and

793
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,940
and the workaround so we're going to try

794
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,039
another way so they built this logic

795
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,960
into it but you know Google's going to

796
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,059
keep up on it kind of a thing

797
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,080
so

798
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,659
once you eventually get there

799
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,400
man

800
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,860
so hey I'm not doxing them these are

801
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,200
people who are actually here but you

802
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,460
know here's some people who are listed

803
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,500
on the website here's some IP addresses

804
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,740
where Utah Saints hosted and here's some

805
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,059
utahsaint.org emails they used to have

806
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,980
these emails but then they had to take

807
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,200
them away because uh Utah Saints a

808
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,299
non-profit so some of these emails might

809
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,799
work I used to have a Utah Saint email

810
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,840
but it's gone now because they had to

811
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,179
they had to shut it off and then some

812
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,220
URLs and stuff what's interesting is

813
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,400
when you can use this you can find like

814
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,419
vpn.company.com it's like oh they have a

815
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,220
corporate VPN I wonder if I should try

816
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,779
to attack that so I can get internal

817
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,340
access

818
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,080
okay rant over

819
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,380
all right photos and videos so the

820
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,000
internet's a lot better since it got

821
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,620
photos and videos back when it used to

822
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,600
be all text-based HTML it wasn't as fun

823
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,860
to read and stuff but now we have photos

824
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,820
and videos

825
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,260
but with that there's a lot of

826
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,640
information

827
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,940
that we put up there exif data

828
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,980
interchangeable image file format so

829
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,659
this is basically metadata about files

830
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:55,919
uh you'll hear about it a lot with

831
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,080
photos and videos but any file can have

832
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,580
access data there's a tool called

833
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,919
exiftool works on Linux I believe it

834
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,539
works on Windows if not there's one just

835
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,179
like it I guarantee it and it's nice

836
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,820
because you can get time stamps when it

837
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,140
was created when it was formatted so

838
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,520
this is also great for forensics if

839
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,900
you're doing forensics when was this

840
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,240
file created when was it modified oh

841
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,799
they time stomped it because it's all

842
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,059
zeroed out

843
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,919
kind of stuff

844
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,880
um

845
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,500
if it was taken with a phone that had

846
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,539
location turned on you can get Geo

847
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,100
information data

848
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,899
so that's kind of creepy so this is

849
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,419
something I took back in 2020 we were

850
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,899
doing a capture the flag and the thing

851
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,520
was on exif data so I took a picture of

852
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,620
my feet on the ground and they said

853
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,659
where am I and that was the flag sort of

854
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,140
a thing so you know once you get the the

855
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,059
GPS location you can figure out where it

856
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,940
is kind of stuff what's interesting that

857
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,700
I've that I've noticed is you can upload

858
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,600
these full like full exif data files

859
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,240
like photos to like your social media or

860
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,220
whatever and then it's uploaded hey look

861
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,659
at your new album and then you download

862
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,419
it again it's gone like they removed the

863
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,640
geolocation data but if you search it's

864
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,100
like Provo Utah and these photos pop up

865
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,320
so it's like hey we're removing the exif

866
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
data for your protection but we're

867
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
totally holding on to it so you can

868
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,340
conveniently search it

869
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,620
intermediate it's the worst ER anger

870
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,000
anyway

871
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,380
um there are tools you can like remove

872
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,080
X's like I think I have a an Android app

873
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,299
called XF Pro so like if I'm going to

874
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,640
share a picture or whatever like I don't

875
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,559
I never put my GPS stuff on unless I'm

876
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,480
doing an example like this I'll actually

877
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,460
like put my photo into XF Pro and say

878
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,140
remove all exif data and then I'll share

879
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,299
that one or text that one to whatever

880
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,740
whatever it might be

881
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,020
so kind of interesting

882
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,419
photos and videos so reverse image

883
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,340
search this is becoming more and more

884
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,080
popular there's more places you can do

885
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,140
it you can search by image you can

886
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,120
upload the image to Google and it'll

887
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,399
search similar images or if it can find

888
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,200
that exact image it'll do checksums and

889
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,700
look for the exact one or look for

890
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,399
similar there's other places that do it

891
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,020
and then

892
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,760
that wasn't creepy enough let's go

893
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,559
creepy okay

894
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,179
Pim eyes this has been around for a bit

895
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,100
you now have to sign up for it

896
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,600
there is one that just came out called

897

warning this is creepy if you weren't

913
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,520
creeped out yet we're going to get

914
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,980
creepy now so

915
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,200
here's a picture of me made sure I had

916
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
some light behind me I took this a few

917
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,100
years ago made sure my like a weird

918
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,779
crooked smile so because you know how

919
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,399
they do like landmarks on your face to

920
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,960
map your face and everything let's see

921
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
if they can find a picture of me with my

922
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,399
weird distorted horribly bearded face

923
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,899
and dorky hair

924
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,779
oh sure enough it did look at this so

925
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,059
that's my LinkedIn profile pic and it's

926
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,980
pixely on purpose and they put a bit

927
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,080
more pixels around it so I was trying to

928
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,640
look like a scary intimidated security

929
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,559
professional I don't know if it worked

930
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,960
this is from a photo shoot of family

931
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,720
photos we had 12 years ago and that's on

932
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,799
the uh

933
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,779
the photographer's website so I'm like

934
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,740
oh

935
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,200
that's great

936
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,360
dang and I tried to distort my face and

937
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
everything it still found me I'm not the

938
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,559
guy in the middle and I'm definitely not

939
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,760
that hunk on the bottom right

940
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,159
searching a little deeper

941
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,960
found a bit more

942
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,880
Max that guy on the bottom center looks

943
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,080
like you

944
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,940
yeah

945
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,520
so going a bit deeper it found me this

946
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,039
was a Defcon talk that I gave

947
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,299
um the past two years they had the

948
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,919
option to pre-record Defcon talks and

949
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,080
then afterwards you hop on to Discord

950
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,720
and they live stream you for the Q a so

951
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,919
I was doing this and I was talking and

952
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,179
sure enough they found me and what's

953
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,159
creepier is this is on some Russian

954
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,659
website

955
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,840
great my face is on a Russian website

956
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,279
this sucks

957
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,260
so

958
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,600
is anyone not creeped out yet I'm trying

959
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
to creep people out use those in for

960
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,220
good I don't okay

961
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,899
videos you can do some stuff with videos

962
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,539
again close-up of ocent framework under

963
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,799
the videos tabs but these are different

964
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,360
places you can look where people have

965
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,279
uploaded videos a lot of times you have

966
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,899
these bigger video sites that'll take

967
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,580
them down if they're like offensive

968
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
don't meet our community guidelines

969
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,840
things like that but there's

970
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,179
there's lots of stuff

971
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,919
all right Skitty time there are enough

972
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,500
there are tools Recon NG this is a great

973
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,240
one

974
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,860
um this is this is definitely geared

975
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,120
it's open source it's made by Black

976
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,620
Hills information security if you're not

977
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,000
following them or on their Discord

978
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,279
server I really suggest you check it out

979
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,559
they put out good content they have

980
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,500
really good webinars they also do

981
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,740
um pay pay what you want online courses

982
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,659
which are really great mostly open

983
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,879
source almost always open source Black

984
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,418
Hills infosec it's a John Strand and

985
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,940
those folk I really like it anyway

986
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,820
similar thing it's uh Recon NG you get

987
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,020
your API keys from these different

988
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,520
search sites you load them in and then

989
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
you can start searching and as you

990
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,580
search it'll keep a record of things

991
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,899
that you find so it'll kind of build out

992
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,060
the report for you because when a lot of

993
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,619
times when you're doing osin you'll find

994
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,179
the stuff maybe take screenshots or

995
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,619
whatever but then like if you want to go

996
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:32,879
back and do it you got to rerun the

997
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,099
search or whatever Recon NG is great

998
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,540
because it builds out that report for

999
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,659
you

1000
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,918
um this is just a little a little demo I

1001
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,300
think

1002
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,339
I think I just started it up and loaded

1003
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,719
some

1004
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,699
um loaded some plugins or something like

1005
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,099
that if I remember correctly

1006
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,320
but yeah

1007
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,879
blackhillsinfosec.com you know

1008
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,300
there you go and yeah so these are all

1009
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,020
the different like Mass scan end map

1010
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,400
um

1011
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,599
census who is Data GitHub Showdown like

1012
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,460
so these are all the different plugins

1013
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,140
they have built into it so if you plug

1014
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,180
in your API keys and you start doing

1015
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,000
your recon you know Recon ngos help

1016
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,220
build that stuff out so and then you can

1017
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,419
you know go from there

1018
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,500
and that's not what oh okay

1019
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,540
I mentioned that you can use osin to

1020
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,700
save lives I'm not kidding you actually

1021
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,160
can so there's some organizations out

1022
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,960
there but one of them is Trace labs they

1023
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,320
have free ctfs that they do periodically

1024
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,339
throughout the year they did it at

1025
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,040
Defcon this year so basically you use

1026
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,800
ocean they crowdsource things to find

1027
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,440
missing persons like real life hopefully

1028
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,040
live real people who are missing and the

1029
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,500
crowdsources like hey hackers use your

1030
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
osense skills to help us find this so my

1031
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,859
team at Defcon this year we actually got

1032
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,240
to participate in this and it was really

1033
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,180
cool it was it was kind of a slog like

1034
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,800
we only had four hours to do it but

1035
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,960
basically they gave us the FBI missing

1036
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,079
poster it's like missing this girl age

1037
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,060
this last scene wearing this last scene

1038
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,040
at this location any information you can

1039
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,320
have and that's all you have so you

1040
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,579
start going through social media you

1041
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,380
start like

1042
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,960
looking for known associates

1043
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,640
um you know maybe she was at this party

1044
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,079
or whatever were there other people at

1045
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,460
the party did they post pictures of it

1046
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,800
is there exif data from that from those

1047
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,619
photos and the way it's a CTF is like

1048
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,720
hey if you find like family member

1049
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,760
profile 10 points if you find this

1050
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,920
whatever points if you find results on

1051
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,720
the dark web for this person it's like a

1052
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,480
hundred points so we were searching for

1053
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,000
real people who were actually missing

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,859
and all we had was like the FBI missing

1055
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,700
poster it was really cool and I I think

1056
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm okay at Ocean but oh man they were

1057
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,720
the there were teams that won it was

1058
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,820
insane and what's nice is

1059
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,579
they take all this data from these ctfs

1060
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,619
and they build a professional like build

1061
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,359
package or whatever like information

1062
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,099
dossier and they give it to law

1063
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,240
enforcement like here's all the

1064
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,740
information you need probably don't have

1065
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,140
the resources to get here go find this

1066
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,359
person really cool Trace Labs check it

1067
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,200
out

1068
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,579
and they do it throughout the year it's

1069
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,320
not always like at conferences a lot of

1070
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,140
times it's online ctfs really cool stuff

1071
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,300
oh I I did want to mention they have

1072
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,820
their own Cali VM that's oscent oriented

1073
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,640
there's a there's some other VMS like

1074
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
buskador and stuff that are ocean

1075
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,260
specific virtual machines but Trace Labs

1076
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,180
has one and that's one we used and I

1077
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,119
liked it

1078
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,400
decreasing open Effectiveness so reason

1079
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,500
I was creepy is because I am I'm just

1080
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,720
kidding it's so you can think about how

1081
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,540
can I be less findable like I don't want

1082
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,760
people finding out certain things about

1083
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,520
me like privacy enthusiasts whatever so

1084
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,140
don't over share if you don't need

1085
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,940
social media get rid of it a lot of

1086
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,440
times you can request your data so I got

1087
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,260
rid of Facebook a while back and never

1088
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,760
had an Instagram and

1089
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,800
different things like that but what you

1090
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,300
can do is you can actually request your

1091
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,859
data and see all the information they

1092
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:02,880
have on you

1093
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,859
because legally they have to and it can

1094
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,960
be a big download so let's say you're

1095
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,940
ready to get off of this social media

1096
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,260
platform that you have but you have all

1097
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,420
these family photos on it you can

1098
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,940
download all of those save them you know

1099
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,740
somewhere securely external hard drive

1100
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,119
something like that and then you can

1101
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,320
delete your account

1102
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,180
and then or you can like delete the

1103
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,520
photos and then delete your account it's

1104
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,020
something you could do make sure your

1105
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,880
stuff's locked down

1106
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,660
um gdpr related things you could also

1107
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,240
um you know if if you qualify like based

1108
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,880
in you at UK or the CCPA if you're in

1109
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,339
California you can say hey delete my

1110
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,900
account the the right to be forgotten

1111
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,339
and more states in the United States are

1112
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,540
actually applying that same principle

1113
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,400
like I want you to remove my stuff

1114
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,960
because I know you're selling it to

1115
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,760
third-party people and that's creepy and

1116
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,839
stop it

1117
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,660
so you can also go through the different

1118
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,820
data broker sites and say hey delete my

1119
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,380
information I don't want it I'll have

1120
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,180
some links at the end that talks about

1121
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,339
that

1122
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,000
um

1123
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
just kidding I'll have some links right

1124
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,240
now that talk about that

1125
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,420
so I can't talk enough good about Intel

1126
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,359
techniques.com Michael basil runs this

1127
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,640
website he and his team and he also has

1128
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,980
a podcast called the security privacy

1129
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,900
and osin podcast every week they have an

1130
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,880

1131
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,880

1132
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,400
main books one is on Extreme privacy and

1133
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,560
this covers everything I I have a copy

1134
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,040
of it and it's like 600 Pages like how

1135
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,260
to it's not like Get Off the Grid and be

1136
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,060
a Hermit it's like live a normal life

1137
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,420
but you know how to have your house in a

1138
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,579
in a trust how to purchase vehicles

1139
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,320
through an LLC so it's not tied to your

1140
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
name how to do this and it's not like

1141
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,339
I'm doing it because I want to commit

1142
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,079
crime or anything it's like I don't want

1143
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,400
people finding this public information

1144
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,740
about me because it's my information and

1145
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,160
I don't have to share it it is some work

1146
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,339
but yeah anyway the Three Links up there

1147
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,980

got new cell phone numbers immediately

1174
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,579

1175
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,800

1178
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,859
married still in school

1179
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,260
but she started getting daily calls from

1180
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,400
debt collectors and it was always

1181
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,720
different sometimes it was like a

1182
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,760
paralegal at a law office sometimes it

1183
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,099
was this and they're like hey it's like

1184
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,619

1185
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,000
whatever like I don't even know the

1186
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,200
person's name anymore

1187
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,480

1191
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,900
so

1192
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,640
kind of annoying we had the person the

1193
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,500
former owner's name and we obviously had

1194
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,260
the former person's phone number so we

1195
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,400
have a name and a phone number let's

1196
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,900
start doing some ocean find out who this

1197
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,280
is because they kept calling we're like

1198
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,720
hey it's not us

1199
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,099
she must have changed her cell phone

1200
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,079
because we just bought this they kept at

1201
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,520
it because it's the only number they

1202
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,599
have to call

1203
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,520
so they kept coming after

1204
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,740
they kept calling so I found the person

1205
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,540
I started looking on LinkedIn social

1206
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,940
media she had her Facebook wide open so

1207
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,560
I had her name like okay that's a

1208
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,480
picture of her lives in the same

1209
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,060
geographic area the phone number was a

1210
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,820

1211
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,160

1212
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,200
Lake now or whatever okay

1213
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,839
and they kept calling back and so we

1214
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,339
started doing this almost sent found her

1215
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,980
LinkedIn profile and yep it was the same

1216
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,660
picture pretty sure pretty high

1217
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,640
confidence is the same person

1218
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,099
so then you know you call up the company

1219
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,540

1284
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,000
This Is Us

1285
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,280
13 months go by and we're like okay this

1286
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,260
is ridiculous like you know we want our

1287
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,200
money back you know and the phone

1288
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,420
stopped working so we drive to the

1289
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,119
warehouse or the showroom it's boarded

1290
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,880
up we go to the website it's gone and

1291
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,619
we're like not cool why like I I I feel

1292
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,720
sad their business went under but could

1293
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,220
they have been more transparent instead

1294
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,660
of like leading them on kind of a thing

1295
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,880
so we were kind of upset and then I see

1296
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,640
it on the news I should have formatted

1297
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,380
this so it was better to see okay anyway

1298
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,079
investigative Journal journalism is like

1299
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,900
hey a bunch of people put like you know

1300
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,060
over a hundred thousand dollars in like

1301
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,280
from different customers not that much

1302
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,280
but like grand total of this custom

1303
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
furniture place he's like come on it's

1304
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,000

1306
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,119
anywhere their names aren't listed

1307
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,040
anywhere on their website kind of thing

1308
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,480
it was really frustrating store

1309
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,640
unavailable kind of stuff

1310
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,319
the Better Business Bureau had no luck

1311
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:34,140
tracking them down so the official body

1312
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,540
organization trying to track this down

1313
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,420
couldn't even find them

1314
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,579
so I was wrong so I started doing some

1315
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,500
motion

1316
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,480
so I went to the website went to the web

1317
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,819
archive the internet archive and I went

1318
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,980
back in time it's kind of cool but it's

1319
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,020
like hey look at this contact us page it

1320
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,480
lists her name and it lists

1321
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,540
um illust the uh phone numbers okay so

1322
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,859
now I have a name and a phone number I

1323
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,240
can start looking that up I know the

1324
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,440
phone number doesn't work anymore but

1325
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,780
now I can track that dun and Bradstreet

1326
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,980
I can look up their company information

1327
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,480
because even if the company goes under

1328
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,700
you know these business data collectors

1329
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
are still going to keep it

1330
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,480
um started doing some Google Dorking I

1331
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,040
found blog posts I found YouTube videos

1332
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,240
where they were interviewing this person

1333
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,680
so I was like okay

1334
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,140
kind of tracking them down

1335
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,000
um Family Tree now this is a great and

1336
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,319
horrible website but you can find

1337
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,720
people's actual addresses and Associates

1338
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,700
and phone numbers

1339
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,020
I don't know how long it's going to be

1340
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,880
free but anyway

1341
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,200
there you go

1342
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,579
so

1343
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,500
you know track them down okay and I've

1344
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,020
and I've blurted out so I found a more

1345
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,060
current thing I went through Dunham

1346
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,619
Bradstreet with that

1347
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,020
family tree now got our first and last

1348
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,900
name and then I went into DNS records

1349
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,359
now the domain was anonymously

1350
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,339
registered it wasn't anonymously

1351
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,560
registered in 2016. it was tied to her

1352
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,240
dad her business partner and he still

1353
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,920
lived at his address and from there I

1354
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,900
could find where she lived and it's like

1355
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,180
okay she lives there and I found cache

1356
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,980
data about her thing I was like okay

1357
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,560
come on so

1358
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,800
so what do I do oh so what do I do

1359
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,540

1372
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,440

1373
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,560
crowdsourcing law don't judge gosh so

1374
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,260
judgy

1375
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,000
okay my last story

1376
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,040
I was in a car accident I-15 back in

1377
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,040
June 2021 it kind of sucked

1378
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,140
um I was rear-ended on I-15 it was rush

1379
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,200
hours like you know everyone is going

1380
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,300
home so we're all you know lots of cars

1381
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,160
we were going like 30 40 miles an hour

1382
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,099
and stop and go traffic and so I came

1383
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,440
into a lane by the way if you're an

1384
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,060
incident responder and then you fill out

1385
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,700
a police report it's really detailed and

1386
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,260
you write it like an incident because it

1387
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,420
is so I was like here's the diagram here

1388
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,000
I was I moved over here you know I came

1389
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,980
up to the next car we slowed down and

1390
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,480
we're all going like 30 miles an hour

1391
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,980
and then we came to like five miles an

1392
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,800
hour this big Ford F-350 with a flatbed

1393
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,079
truck he was going 60 and I saw him in

1394
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,940
my rear viewers like shoot I can't move

1395
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,440
and I couldn't go to either side or

1396
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,180
anything I hear him slam on his brakes

1397
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,680
and two whole seconds you know how

1398
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,359
everything slows down two whole seconds

1399
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,040
I could hear the tire skidding before he

1400
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,859
rear-ended me it's like oh you know I

1401
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,300
was really upset about it but you know

1402
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,339
we weren't hurt it was just me in the

1403
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:39,720
car it was just him in the car not

1404
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,700
wearing glasses I found out later

1405
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,980
so here's the official report filled it

1406
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,500
out you know here's here's his stuff and

1407
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,000
you know I blurred blurred things out

1408
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,040
and everything where did it happen now

1409
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,900
this is dumb because I gave my insurance

1410
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,460
information everything and I knew where

1411
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,800
the guy lived you know he listed his

1412
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,780
you know information but it was a work

1413
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,760
truck it was a construction truck

1414
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,700
Insurance appears valid if only there

1415
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,020
was a way you could access the internet

1416
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,359
remotely from a mobile device and like

1417
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,700
do a quick check if it was out no yeah

1418
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,260
it looks good what's the insurance

1419
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,660
company commercial

1420
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,720
has anyone heard of Commercial Insurance

1421
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,060
P.S it doesn't exist made up Insurance

1422
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,859
totally fake

1423
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,260
so I wasn't at fault he wasn't excited

1424
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,119
but he did rear end me I was at a stop

1425
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,920
on the freeway like everyone else except

1426
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,920
him so I was like shoot okay

1427
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,599
so I call it my insurance like we can't

1428
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,220
do anything well what's his insurance

1429
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,319
numbers like it says like that's not a

1430
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,119
real thing that's totally made up

1431
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
serious

1432
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,020
so what do you do

1433
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,940
you do some motion

1434
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,579
so fya takes 10 business days before you

1435
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:48,780
can get the official crash report before

1436
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,520
you can do anything unless they cite

1437
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,440
them at the site and then give them a

1438
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,359
citation then you can start

1439
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,480
so you know invalid company that that

1440
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,700
was a blocker you know couldn't drive my

1441
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,680
car I can't get it fixed unless I decide

1442
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,720
to pay for it out of pocket or file an

1443
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,460
insurance claim I pay my deductible and

1444
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,780
eventually try to get the money from

1445
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,099
that insurance and eventually get that

1446
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:11,280
back to me it not happy about this by

1447
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,839
the way we're about to leave the country

1448
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,880
as a family we were going to house swap

1449
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,500
with some people and they were going to

1450
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,660
use that car I mean we had a minivan as

1451
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,660
well but it's like shoot that's this is

1452
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,060
not cool I'm kind of mad about this so

1453
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,619
we're going to Ocean

1454
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,720
so I confirmed his address make sure the

1455
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,520
address that it on the report actually

1456
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,740
matched up to him you know not like it

1457
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,480
his driver's license was an old address

1458
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,359
or something okay and then started

1459
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,339
researching uh insurance policy numbers

1460
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:41,160
so that this is hard but some of the

1461
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,780
format different insurance companies

1462
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,040
have different format I think it was

1463
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,500
State Auto or something and I was trying

1464
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,579
to figure it out so you know I'm doing

1465
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,160
my site colon I'm trying to find jpegs

1466
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,460
of or PDFs of like policy numbers and I

1467
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,540
started doing some research on this

1468
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,740
Construction Company it's a national

1469
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,640

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
so the rest of this story is totally

1475
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,119
hypothetical

1476
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,920
so I looked up the career page National

1477
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,540
change they they needed a commercial

1478
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,000
roofer in the Salt Lake area

1479
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,380
through college I was a commercial

1480
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,079
roofer so that's how I paid tuition

1481
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,880
and so I used my sudo if you don't use

1482
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,880
my sudo check it out emails actual phone

1483
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,040
numbers is great and I have a burner

1484
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,680
LinkedIn account for oh sent reasons so

1485
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,359
I applied for the job and I interviewed

1486
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,520

1488

00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,880

00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,640
too fast for conditions and following

1588
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,880
too close so we accept liability we will

1589
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,740
start the process or whatever cool cool

1590
