so what you're interested in stats you

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,220
want to know all the stats of those

49
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,619
crazy things that happened right

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,380
so most solves with the puzzle filter it

51
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,960
uh well number of solves there a large

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,700
percentage of the players solve that one

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,640
not everybody but most

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,740
uh challenge with the least solves this

55
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,299
isn't unsolved we have a couple unsolved

56
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,880
ones but it least solves only one player

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,000
solved uh burned the bridge

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,900
uh players or peoples with the most

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,940
solves you will see there's two names

60
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,239
there

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
um we've got toxicity and label clones

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,920
both at the most solves uh this is not

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,879
where I'm telling you who's winning

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,739
hackers challenge this year you got the

65
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,360
closing Ceremonies for that

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,340
uh even if

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,020
um one name of this Earth most solves

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,099
does not mean they have the most points

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,379
so very interesting

70
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,319
uh total possible uh 12 people who solve

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,400
the challenge so we had a lot of players

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,319
this year it was great to see 264

73
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,360
players uh that actually solve the

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,440
challenge

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,300
um not everybody that registered uh

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,099
actually were they able to solve one but

77
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,560
264 to actually solve a single is a good

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,700
hit

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,180
uh 57 people that played enough to solve

80
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,800
a full 10 puzzles

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,420
um what this tells me is that I didn't

82
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,280
do enough beginner puzzles I I'm sorry

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,800
if the the the challenge difficulty went

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,260
from a couple easy ones to high medium

85
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,879
to high high hard

86
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,500
um I need to get something more in that

87
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,540
lower range message heard

88
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,519
uh 363

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
wrong answer guesses uh for the puzzle

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,620
with the most wrong answers

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,540
that would be the crypto means

92
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,060
glibberish puzzle

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,300
and then the player you know who you are

94
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,840
267 wrong guesses throughout the game

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,180
[Laughter]

96
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,920
uh which ends up to being uh about uh 41

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,599
uh correct answers and somewhere around

98
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,298
59 uh wrong answers throughout the game

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,519
uh total 68 challenges on the board uh

100
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,440
we did not do hacker Jeopardy this year

101
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,819
um you guys were having fun with what

102
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,680
was on the board uh I didn't want to

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,239
throw in another range of distraction

104
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,340
you

105
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,959

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,459
trivia will be coming back next year do

107

be infrastructure in Azure uh for you to

122
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,620
attack I'm telling you that now

123
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,220
uh we had 28 or 28 instances uh

124
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,759
somewhere several dozen uh C names uh

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,560
there will be some lambdas next year I'm

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,639
just telling you that there's some fun

127

challenges there for the you'll see

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Rachel says he couldn't do because he

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,180
couldn't figure out Lambda

130
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,740
um we had some ideas that would have

131
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,660
been fun for like the hash collider that

132
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,680
definitely could have been a Lambda

133
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,220
instead of an S3 instance but next year

134
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,479
uh S3 objects we stored 100 megabytes of

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,840
S3 objects over 9000 unique items we

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
were logging your activities be it in

137
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,780
the hash collider or in the Shell games

138
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,820
oh you'll see some of those fun things

139
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,840
that you have produced for us

140

uh and Plum I have to call it Plum yes

169
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,580
Plum frizz provided a couple of re

170
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,580
challenges uh some one of his own design

171
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,319
and one some some inspiration from

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,539
myself as well

173
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,840
so a really very big thank you to uh the

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,740
contributors that helped me build

175
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,840
hackers challenge uh they love as much

176
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,819
as you do and have had fun with it and

177
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,759
it makes it a wonderful game

178
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,440
uh this was one of my favorite

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
challenges this year it was pre-con

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,740
challenge that showed its face on the

181
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,800
board uh did you have fun with it

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,940
okay

183
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,139
um I would have loved to produce this

184
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,600
coin and provide it to you uh

185
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,699
I actually started 3D modeling to do

186
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,039
that didn't get to that point so uh

187
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,900
maybe next year the coin will surface as

188
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,620
a physical coin

189
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
any questions did anybody not solve it

190
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,360
or

191
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,199
curious about it

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,400
okay so let's talk about this for a

193
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
second so this coin is a lot of very

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,660
basic classic crypto uh stuff that's

195
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,860
kind of fun

196
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,120
um let's look at the front of the coin

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,699
and you'll see around the face there's

198
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,139
the hackers challenge words on the

199
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:34,800
outside

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,500
on the inside you'll find Braille dots

201
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,020
and those

202
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,620
no Siri I won't try again

203
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,199
um so these Braille dots indicated

204
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,740
numbers one two three four five

205
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,660
six

206
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,580
um and you'll notice that those dots are

207
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,819
underneath letters so one under an a

208
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,639
two under a t and so This spells out the

209
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,160
the name at Bash

210
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
which is the next Cipher that's used for

211
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,960
the outside ring of this coin

212
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,060
so at bash is a classic crypto Cipher

213
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,660
where you it's a equals Z's and uh b

214
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,319
equals y and just reverses the alphabet

215
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,300
and so once you've used app bash on the

216
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,740
outer ring you get a hint that says

217
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,080
something to the effect of uh

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,300
seven width five deep

219
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,759
with some of my favorite classic hacker

220
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,860
hints and you should go decode it and

221
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,479
see and see the messages

222
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,520
uh 5y70 means you go ahead and take

223
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
these uh

224
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,500
70 characters and you right across seven

225
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,120
characters

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,399
I crossed across the crust

227
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,979
seven characters and five down and after

228
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,300
you've done that you have a square then

229
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,100
you have to create a new square and do

230
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
the same thing

231
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,980
and so with these two squares you can

232
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,160
then read the message down the columns

233
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,200
to get to the next step

234
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,640
that will end with a hint towards xores

235
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,440
and so then you take these binary you

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,140
take these this this hexadecimal

237
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,300
uh digit string and you xor that against

238
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,540
the center text

239
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,680
there's a there's there's a gotcha there

240
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,180
if you're using tools like cyber Chef it

241
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,120
works on byte boundaries it won't work

242
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
on nibble boundaries and so I gave you

243
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,540
five nibbles or two and a half bytes

244
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,220
so it breaks cyberships

245
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,600
so you either have to find a way to make

246
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
it split on a byte boundary as in double

247
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,779
the

248
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,779
string or uh

249
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,640
do it by hand which is why I wanted you

250
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,640
to learn it's a lot of fun

251
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,380
so I had fun creating that one for you I

252
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,880
hope you enjoyed it

253
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,260
another one that people bugged me about

254
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,839
said why doesn't this scan on my phone

255
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,240
why does my app work why doesn't it scan

256
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,800
on the online app

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,660
um this is anybody know what what this

258
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,399
QR code is now and that's not QR code

259
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,260
it's 2D 2D barcode

260
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,040
what is it

261
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,300
it's a data Matrix

262
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
and the reason people are having problem

263
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,660
with scanning is because it's actually a

264
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,760
mirrored image

265
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,740
and if your app or your tool doesn't

266
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,320
properly detect it as a mirror image or

267
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,420
a rotated image which some of the apps

268
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,860
are just very lazy and they expect it

269
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,160
one way then doesn't work uh I tested on

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,720
compiling tools and various apps that do

271
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,980
work and take it all like when they

272
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,140
build a redundant compatible app they'll

273
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,180
get you to website how many here saw

274
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,940
clippy hands up did you like Clippy

275
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,120
foreign

276
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,600
in a chrome in Chrome Google Chrome

277
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,339
um

278
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,080
the key was in your clipboard

279
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,820
immediately as soon as you click the

280
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,500
copy key button

281
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,060
it overwrote whatever was in the

282
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,019
clipboard all you have to do is load the

283
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,779
page and paste the key into anywhere and

284
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,339
you already had the key

285
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,440
one it was a fun troll if you didn't see

286
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
it I want to show it to you

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,040
um

288
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,839
and I told him it doesn't have sound but

289
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,040
this one does have sound and it doesn't

290
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,600
matter um

291
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,700
well this was mini badge yeah minimatch

292
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,660
there we go

293
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,459
so

294
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,680
we've got clippy here uh clippy's

295
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,620
Revenge popping up

296
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
make another uh the classic clippy

297
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,779
sounds bouncing around giving you hints

298
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,240
um once again now the right now that the

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,980
key is in my clipboard so if I were to

300
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,360
come up here

301
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,640
the the flag that you needed is that

302
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,540
flag

303
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,180
the real flag was the friends we made

304
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,959
along the way

305
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,779
as soon as you clicked the copy flag or

306
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,220
tried to paste copy and paste this flag

307
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,959
here it over what was in the clipboard

308
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,300
and you didn't find your key I I know

309
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
many of you spent hours digging through

310
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
the jQuery uh

311
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,220
JavaScript where this uh this was hidden

312
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,440
but uh the easy way was just to run and

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
chrome and paste it into your as your

314
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,500
key

315
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,760
okay clippy bye

316
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,779
okay unsolved challenges there are two

317
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,880
on the board uh the root of the problem

318
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,860
and in plain sight

319
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,079
root of the problem uh this was an

320
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,420
interesting challenge uh right Jason you

321
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,279
want to talk a little bit about it your

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,300
experiences digging through it

323
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
Specter you only walk up here and tell

324
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,279
us a little bit

325
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,720
okay

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,060
so really the challenge was unsolved uh

327
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,860
essentially it was a hardware device it

328
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,660
was down in the Healthcare Community

329
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,420
um and it there was some difficulty

330
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,579
there that it he we believed it to be

331
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,959
vulnerable to a CDE and an issue that it

332
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,600
actually was not vulnerable to and so in

333
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,680
order to solve this one you would have

334
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,140
had to tear apart the device and do some

335
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,740
Hardware hacking

336
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,660
in plain sight I have this on my slide

337
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,459
armor which one it is

338
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,719
oh vericrypt yes

339
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,500
let's pull up my notes here because I

340
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,800
don't remember

341
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,880
Okay so

342
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
veracrypt we have a very Crypt volume

343
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,060
that the uh is the so very quickly has

344
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,560
an outer volume and inner volume the

345
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,660
password to the inner volume is shane134

346
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,519
so the idea was here that you'd be able

347
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,779
to Brute Force this password based off

348
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,180
of the list of passwords and examples of

349
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,260
what they'd used you would notice that

350
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,480
this favorite number once was 134 the

351
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,279
names that they had reused in these and

352
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,779
so you'd build this password list based

353
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,100
off all these examples that were already

354
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,399
used

355
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,680
so pretty easy to confirm that and then

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,300
in that volume once you're open there's

357
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,160
a couple red herrings

358
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,139
um so you don't waste your time in there

359
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,779
and then uh there was a hidden volume

360
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,980
inside that that was pretty obvious

361
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,480
supposed to be pretty obvious to crack

362
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,139
the hidden volume once again is

363
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,779
Charlotte 134 once once again built on

364
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,860
that same password list say favorite

365
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,300
numbers

366
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
uh except that there was a custom

367
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,920
iteration count

368
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,420
um once again though if you see that and

369
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,500
you're trying how many times I iterate

370
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,360
through this it's it's that same number

371
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,240
that's showing up in the whole string

372
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,339
and then there's a file that was deleted

373
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,300
in that volume with the flag

374
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,639
uh it was a complex challenge

375
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,399
so those are two other board that were

376
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,500
unsolved this year

377
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,880
um I would love to hear Lessons Learned

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
and your feedback and experiences with

379
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,820
them I like to have difficult challenges

380
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm Not Afraid those ones unsolved on

381
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,440
the board but I want to tune these so

382
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,959
that they play well for you too

383
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
okay so let's talk about some of the fun

384
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,720
stuff up here and some of the

385
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,579
interesting things that we saw uh from

386
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,220
your logs and then we will uh I'll be

387
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,180
open for a few questions for other

388
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,540
challenges

389
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,560
so there was a

390
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,720
do I need to put that up should be on

391
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,660
all right so there was a challenge uh

392
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,279
that I I gave you this image I teach at

393
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,260
Idaho State University

394
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
and I gave you this image and you have

395
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
to give me two images back one that

396
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,660
looks like mine

397
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,639
and one that doesn't but yours have to

398
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
have the same md5 hash and there's a

399
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,839
tool online that will do this and I got

400
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,760
some great submissions for images that

401
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,440
don't look like mine

402
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,260
this was my submission very you know

403
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,480
very very uh plain oh and thank you for

404
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,980
not giving me making me look at

405
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,760
inappropriate images

406
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
very clean Community

407
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,279
um yes

408
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,980
uh I I was afraid of what I would see

409
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,540
when I when I started going through the

410
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,100
images

411
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,880
um this does not look like my image

412
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
right

413
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
um also

414
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,199
not my image

415
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,620
uh

416
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,959
this appears to be a different tool that

417
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
I haven't seen before and I'm curious

418
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
whoever submitted this one I'd love to

419
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,079
know what tool you use to generate it it

420
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,060
just says image generated by an AI using

421
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,260
md5 blah blah blah blah

422
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:13,020
um

423
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,000
[Laughter]

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,920
this is my new desktop background

425
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,000
this image also does not look like mine

426
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,300
this also doesn't look like mine

427
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
that

428
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,579
yeah

429
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,800
all right so there's another one so I

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,759
want to talk about this one for just one

431
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,320
second so this hash collider image this

432
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
hash oh is this your another image are

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,139
you working on the next challenge no no

434
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,959
that's that's okay

435
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,639
yeah so hash collider this was a fun

436
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
challenge uh this year we finally hit

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,620
the point where md5 collisions aren't

438
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,899
just you have to use a GPU and spend

439
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,899
four hours or eight hours or to get a

440
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,940
hash Collision we have identified

441
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
several methods where you can generate a

442
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,740
collision in images or PDFs or various

443
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,079
other file formats by padding them with

444
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,640
the metadatas and other environments in

445
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,400
those images to match your hashes

446
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
it and there are a bunch of different

447
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,740
okay a lot of you submitted things and

448
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,599
then complained that uh the image

449
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,160
comparison

450
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,459
um didn't work well and everything I

451
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,500
know about image comparison I learned on

452
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Sunday

453
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
so I have to tell you I gave him this

454
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,960
idea for this challenge like Saturday

455
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,900
Saturday so I woke up Sunday morning

456
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,240
like I could do that oh wait a minute

457
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,679
this is a lot harder than I thought it

458
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,320
was yeah so that was my day on on Sunday

459
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,539
but it was it was a lot of fun so it was

460
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,820
a variant of that challenge uh Google

461
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,400
posted all the knowledge you needed to

462
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,160
do for doing the same thing but with

463
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,460
Shaw one and PDF so I gave you an image

464
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,419
that says look don't touch the llama

465
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,940
and these are responses I got this was

466
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,640
my example this is one of our it's our

467
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,100
perform Performing Arts Center at ISU

468
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,200
and this is uh create a challenge that

469
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,460
involves creating a shot one Collision

470
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,260
that'll help everyone understand that

471
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,720
Shaw one should die

472
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,260
okay these images are not like mine

473
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,919
[Laughter]

474
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,440
yeah I don't need to go over those

475
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,100
um also not my images

476
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,639
so

477
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,559
so uh once again these were fun

478
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,760
hopefully you learned a new skill and

479
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,020
you learned something to realize

480
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,299
something about how bad md5 shot ones

481
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,179
really actually are so it is it is

482
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,280
within the power of your laptop now to

483
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,260
uh create

484
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,140
fraudulent images that will match these

485
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,000
similar to the same hash don't do it

486
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,140
yeah and yeah it's it's instantaneous

487
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,280
because I talk about shell games while

488
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm here report yeah okay so

489
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,419
um how many hated Shell Games

490
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,660
how he loved it

491
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,760
I had a heck of a I had a lot of fun

492
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,039
writing them and I'm sorry uh the Shell

493
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,799
Games too was such a problem uh it turns

494
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,240
out VI is not really designed to be a

495
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,120
shell we started on Shield games back in

496
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,520
January yeah yeah and then I kind of

497
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,840
fell off the face of the Earth but I

498
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
came back to it and ended up coming up

499
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
with a total of item these are some of

500
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
the highlights I saw with the Pearl one

501
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,780
so I gave you the problematic eclectic

502
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,419
rubbish Lister uh that Larry gave me

503
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,600
which is Larry wall uh Pearl it's also

504
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,460
folks who tried to use expect I didn't

505
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,020
install any extra packages that takes

506
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
work

507
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,020
um

508
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,600
you didn't you couldn't Fork processes

509
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,460
so system bash say yeah that wasn't

510
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,580
going to work uh file slurp I don't even

511
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,380
know what that is uh somebody tried to

512
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,440
create their own uh slave PTY and really

513
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,299
write a shell I commend the effort

514
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,160
wasn't going to work but I commend the

515
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,340
effort

516
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,620
for law code okay who doesn't love law

517
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,918
code

518
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,220
um somebody wrote a calculator for a law

519
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,480
code or at least pasted one from

520
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
somewhere online unfortunately it has a

521
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,059
syntax error there's also somebody who

522
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,240
just said give me a flag

523
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,900
which didn't work either I'm not posting

524
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,080
things that actually that worked if you

525
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
want those I can talk about those later

526
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,160
and somebody just asked the very logical

527
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,640
question I can has key

528
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
and which didn't work

529
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,720
um somebody tried to upload an HTTP

530
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,380
server and this is actually much longer

531
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,940
and given that you're in a Docker

532
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,039
container with net equals none yeah that

533
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,460
wouldn't go to work

534
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,340
M4 as a shell so has anybody written

535
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,960
send milk and figs back in the battle

536
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,919
days

537
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
all right

538
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
you're as old as me

539
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,820
um so I suffered through M4 so I figured

540
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,919
you did you needed to as well what I

541
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,080
didn't realize is M4 has a way of

542
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,660
executing shell commands and I didn't

543
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,039
really control for that so you got to

544
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,840
get me there

545
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,179
uh for sh

546
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,640
okay I loved this particular example and

547
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
I think this is the last example of my

548
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,539
slide deck they did an LS they said oh

549
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,100
there are files here

550
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,080
and then they read the readme file they

551
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,760
didn't bother to read the key but they

552
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,260
did poke around and say okay what files

553
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,360
are on here you know where where am I

554
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,500
the key it's it's right there

555
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,380
get the key

556
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,059
so

557
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,520
but whatever and if you're interested in

558
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,140
how these challenges were set up I'll

559
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,840
I'll be doing a write-up for how how I

560
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
set these up so that I limited your

561
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,640
scope of influence I did this grew a

562
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,919
couple times oh it did uh and I was

563
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,659
really surprised again a really safe

564
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,840
nice Community I gave you CC as a show

565
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,520
and you could write an arbitrary C

566
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
program and I saw a few people who to

567
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
people who tried to call exec which

568
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,940
wasn't going to work

569
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,980
um uh but nobody tried to create a

570
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,900
reverse shell I was the only one except

571
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,000
for Josh

572
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,080
tried to create a reverse shell out of

573
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,200
the VM which wasn't going to work but

574
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,340
um because I thought of that uh

575
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,200
but anyway that's that's what I've got I

576
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,860
think for awesome slides okay uh we've

577
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,539
got a little bit time here let's I'm

578
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,039
gonna ask you which challenges do you

579
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,240
want to hear about what questions do you

580
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,860
have

581
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,240
you wanna know about nesting dolls

582
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,059
nesting dolls was fun this was the great

583
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,000
contribution by Professor Plum this year

584
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,740
uh

585
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,820
Africa's challenge wouldn't be the same

586
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,059
without one of some of his interesting

587
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,539
nightmarish puzzles

588
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,539
and so Plum says it was just medium hard

589
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,960
this year not hard hard do you agree

590
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,620
laughs

591
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:05,030
[Laughter]

592
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,419
so two of you solved it oh I don't even

593
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,520
have my list of chains here

594
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,720
I've got to walk through the steps here

595
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,679
do I dare

596
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,760
okay give me two seconds here let's see

597
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,620
if I can Discord without making you guys

598
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,479
sick or showing anything I shouldn't

599
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,380
I I have friends do you want to come up

600
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,400
here and talk through it we'd love it

601
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,940
we'll come up

602
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,380
thank you so much

603
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,900
okay so if you want a reminder here's

604
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,539
here's Plum's hints yeah that's perfect

605
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,220
so

606
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm K fate

607
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,260
um I always enjoy hackers challenge this

608
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,299
year I had other stuff so I wasn't

609
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,140
playing

610
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,539
all the time every night

611
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,159
um but still tons of fun and so I

612
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,480
focused on this challenge because I knew

613
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,400
it would be a fun one

614
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,880
the first step was as mentioned you know

615
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,100
get it to not be detected by your

616
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,840
antivirus

617
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,240
um for me that was just when it detected

618
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,100
it go in and say

619
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,740
ignore this one it's okay right

620
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,440
and then the first step I tried was like

621
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,059
okay what happens if I open it up and

622
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,960
run it

623
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,240
um I trust Professor Plum even though

624
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,679
it's saying it's a virus it's not going

625
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,000
to like completely destroy my computer

626
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,820
so I'll do that and and as soon as I do

627
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,980
that anorex frags it again and pulls it

628
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,679
out like oh crap

629
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,620
all right so download it again this is

630
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,840
not a virus right okay let's not run it

631
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,220
let's just

632
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,120
um it's a word doc uh let's do some

633
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,820
analysis with word docs right and pull

634
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,200
out the

635
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,940
um VBA macro and so use tool did that

636
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,960
and on the VBA macro then it's right got

637
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,380
some a called a Powershell and it's like

638
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,480
okay

639
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,580
um let's get the

640
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,460
Powershell script out of there and run

641
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,919
it in Powershell and there there's other

642
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,080
ways to do it like it's looking for

643
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,840
certain flags of if this flag is present

644
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,200
then go ahead and run most of the time

645
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
instead of giving it the key that it's

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,860
looking for I would find a way to bypass

647
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,120
it

648
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,580
um so when like we got to the.net

649
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,559
assembly I can't remember for sure I

650
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,320
think that one was maybe looking for

651
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,140
something in the registry and so instead

652
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,779
of putting the value in the registry I

653
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,400
just used

654
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,539
um Ida to modify the binary and when it

655
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,179
does that check essentially jump over it

656
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,919
and skip it let me just let me mention

657
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,419
it if you miss if you missed some of

658
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,799
these checks if you didn't set the flag

659
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,600
in the registry or you didn't jump over

660
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,880
it you'd get partial flag at the end

661
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,620
you'd have a flag with parts of the

662
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,580
message and then the rest would be

663
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,400
buzzed out or you see if you had to go

664
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,260
back and not just find each of these

665
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,000
steps but you had to actually identify

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,380
what they were doing and patch for it

667
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,440
yeah and so a great point of that is

668
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,159
when it then calls in to the dll it

669
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,919
passes it a value and I couldn't figure

670
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,260
out how to run the dll

671
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,320
by well I could have but of setting the

672
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
right Flags I was running the dll

673
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,720
directly using run dll32 which lets you

674
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,539
just like launch a dll as code

675
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,260
um

676
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,779
but it needs the value that it's passed

677
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,700
in so I would then in Ida go in and

678
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,919
modify the registry and just give it the

679
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,419
value that was passed in so that it

680
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,260
would have it to decode the string and

681
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,900
then the last step

682
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,620
from that dll is it's got a AES

683
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,100
encrypted binary that you run and again

684
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,080
I just used Ida to step through and run

685
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,720
it and that one's making some calls out

686
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,159
to DNS to get a domain name and then to

687
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,220
make a TCP call and so again I'm just

688
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,220
watching looking for those steps and

689
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,140
giving it what it's looking for and each

690
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,640
time you find what it's looking for give

691
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,919
it and then it's able to decode the flag

692
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,380
and at the end you get the message you

693
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,440
know here's the flag thanks good job

694
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,159
thank you

695
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,559
thanks Professor Blum for the great

696
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,400
challenge

697
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,440
I want to call out billions of blocks

698
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
who had fun with Minecraft I know

699
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,700
several of you spent hours on it uh I

700
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,779
hear some of you had some interesting

701
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,820
solutions to it bash can I call you up

702
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,520
the really fun challenges from Minecraft

703
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
so

704
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,940
um let me hold up and just so we can see

705
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,120
the

706
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,120
so basically you're given a Minecraft

707
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,700
seed oh you're given you're given a

708
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,559
Minecraft video and your goal is to find

709
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,900
the seed that generated this world yeah

710
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,640
so if you haven't played Minecraft

711
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,880
before Mike oh good we have a mic Mike

712
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,919
for Mike yep um if you haven't played

713
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
Minecraft before which

714
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,740
um many people haven't believe it or not

715
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,620
um the world is randomly generated so it

716
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,779
just starts with a random number and

717
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,059
based on this number the entire world is

718
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,580
created and so the whole point of it is

719
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,080
what you're you're trying to do is

720
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,940
you're watching this video and you're

721
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,159
looking for parts in the video that are

722
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,799
based off of the seed number and trying

723
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,440
to work backwards and so

724
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,580
um do you think you just pull the video

725
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,279
up for a half second

726
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,260
um and just like skip halfway through

727
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,360
so kind of what well

728
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,179
I mean I've got it here here what what

729
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,460
what he does is he walks around and he

730
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,320
cuts down trees

731
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,520
um so I thought I had her here it's fine

732
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,100
um so he cuts down these trees and and

733
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,179
the method of solving this is based on

734
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,760
the trees there are randomly generated

735
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,580
leaves around the tree and these leaves

736
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,340
are generated based on the seed and so

737
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,320
to solve it what you have to do is you

738
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
have to go through every single tree and

739
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,820
look at the leaves and mark them and you

740
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,240
and then you basically go through and

741
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,059
Brute Force every possible seed that

742
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,580
would have those leaves missing and once

743
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,100
you've got that you end up with a seed

744
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,399
value that you can use to generate the

745
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,380
world but that wasn't good enough

746
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,279
because

747
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,100
Q decided not to let us use the seed

748
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,840
number and we had to come up with the

749
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,899
the written value for this seed of

750
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,240
course so you take this all of these

751
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,919
possible seeds that they could could

752
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,320
have been and you put it into hashcat

753
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,600
and then you run a huge hash cat attack

754
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,299
against this so it is a mix of brute

755
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,520
forcing a seed number and then brute

756
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
forcing

757
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,380
um the written value for it there the

758
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,480
the hardest part for me was in the

759
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,860
beginning of the video If you're looking

760
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,440
at it there is someone that says a chat

761
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
message that says hello world I looked

762
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,539
over that for about three hours this

763
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,600
live overflow person is actually really

764
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,840
important and this is a huge hint this

765
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,120
there's a person who did a video about

766
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,279
three months ago that talks about the

767
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,020
entire process of doing this how

768
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,940
somebody hacked my mind to craft servers

769
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,039
I think yeah he's like they hacked my

770
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
Minecraft server and there's a community

771
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,179
that goes around and watch streamers

772
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,159
videos and will then hack their seeds

773
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,679
and publish them publicly and they have

774
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,299
come gone through and they have found

775
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,039
all of these methods so if you want to

776
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,919
replicate this you can go watch his

777
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,760
video and then spend 45 minutes to 12

778
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,260
hours trying to crack it

779
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,820
um the worst part is he did it at night

780
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,919
so so I will call out a few other

781
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,120
examples I saw I saw with this next

782
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,399
fashion walking us through it I saw

783
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,380
people take and invert the video so they

784
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,659
could have better contrast I saw

785
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,279
somebody take and choose a different

786
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,380
artifact instead of trees to generate

787
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,320
their seeds off of uh one of the what

788
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,419
all effect was it

789
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,700
so you the things I used was one the

790
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,860
portal

791
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,279
portals are are generated for on a

792
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,659
chunkwise basis

793
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,419
and so there's only so many portals so

794
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,659
uh

795
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,340
give me

796
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,779
if you want to come up if you want to

797
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,820
I'd love to have you this is an

798
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,620
interesting puzzle it was fun for uh

799
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,659
being the password crack category

800
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,520
because password cracking isn't always

801
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,200
about cracking just a password there's

802
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,899
other things to attack okay

803
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,700
is it on

804
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,460
uh it should be are we good on the there

805
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,520
it was just turned off okay so the the

806
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,080
artifacts that I was looking at I was

807
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,360
watching them do it with the the trees

808
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,399
and going okay what's this that means

809
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,600
you have to like look at every

810
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,059
individual block when you're doing that

811
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:18,659
um

812
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,940
but there's a portal a ruined portal

813
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,760
there which uh generates uh chunk wise

814
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,279
and so I could check is there a portal

815
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,539
in this chunk

816
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,520
and that was the first thing I did and

817
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,000
that gave me a whole slew of possible uh

818
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,220
outcomes and like bash was talking about

819
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,520
there was a fun fact two to the 64th

820
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,980
million possible or 2 to the 64th

821
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,679
possible seeds so we can do that by the

822
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,980
time the Sun Burns Out maybe

823
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,140
but uh when they when you use a string

824
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,059
it actually cuts that down to two to the

825
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,820
32 which we can do in a it takes about

826
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,700
30 minutes or

827
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,080
15

828
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,480
to 30 minutes just running through every

829
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,399
possible seed

830
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,840
um

831
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
so I use the portal and then to uh limit

832
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
even further I paused the video along

833
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,260
the way and got his current location and

834
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,480
the biome we just blanked out

835
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,539
and so I set a bunch of points along the

836
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,460
way at this point he's in a beach biome

837
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,519
now he jumped to a forest biome back to

838
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,500
a beach biome back to a forest

839
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,220
and I put a bunch of those points in and

840
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,299
then

841
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,279
if it failed anywhere along the way I

842
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,080
just discarded that seed and would go to

843
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,799
the next seed and I had

844
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,200
six or seven points that I actually

845
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,779
sampled so I could have kept adding more

846
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,019
points and made it even tighter but with

847
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,799
six to seven points that gave me six

848
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,720
possible seeds and I just loaded up

849
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,240
Minecraft and with six seeds I can

850
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,399
manually check six different seeds and

851
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,100
so on the Discord server actually pasted

852
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,019
a picture of it during the daytime so

853
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,919
you can see what it looks like

854
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,039
thank you

855
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,500
the other thing is I my solution is

856
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,940
based on somebody else's and I'm going

857
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,918
to document it someplace but it was

858
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,440
written in seed so it C so it runs a lot

859
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,918
faster the other thing is uh uh brute

860
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,679
forcing the uh the the the words what we

861
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,760
wound up doing is we generated a set of

862
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,800
uh we we took uh dect dict the the words

863
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,760
list from Munich's and just made a and

864
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,399
and just hashed all those we had a set

865
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,280
of hashes to check against

866
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
um we had errorism on our part on

867
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,199
reading them in

868
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,418
oh I'll blame me

869
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,280
um it was because I was reading it

870
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
unsigned and it needed to be signed and

871
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,359
uh

872
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,040
so when I figured that out I could have

873
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
actually made it even quicker because I

874
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,580
already had a smaller set of seeds that

875
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,260
I was iterating through

876
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,540
thank you

877
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,800
okay

878
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
um just to tell you the flag there yeah

879
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
staying in theme the flag was creeper

880
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
the the for the seed so

881
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,140
uh any other particular challenges that

882
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,280
people want to call out or ask questions

883
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,079
about

884
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,619
I hope

885
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,780
I don't remember yes there he comes

886
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,560
thank you come on up

887
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,900
I'm sketchik I did the abstract

888
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,220
Community

889
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,260
um so the vulnerability that you're

890
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,060
looking for is related it's the same

891
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,339
kind of vulnerability that was my very

892
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:47,040
first hack so if uh I think Troy's in

893
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
the other room but he owes me a hack

894
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
badge now

895
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,900
um anyway it's Mass assignment so when

896
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,119
you log in or when you register your

897
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,660
user we take all the data in the request

898
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,760
and stick it in the database so if you

899
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,540
put in is underscore super user

900
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,400
as one of your fields and set that to

901
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,380
true and submit that you are a super

902
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,480
user in the application so the solution

903
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,420
is filter out that field make it so that

904
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,800
people can't just make themselves super

905
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,900
user on registration

906
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,500
so taking input that you normally

907
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,480
don't expose the user and they're adding

908
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
that input and you're not filtering it

909
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,020
out awesome and and you could figure

910
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
that out from looking at the database

911
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,920
the the table What fields are in there

912
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,400
and how that data gets to the database

913
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,500
thank you sketchik appreciate it

914
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,839
[Applause]

915
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,220
any others we've got about five minutes

916
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,359
until we need to wrap this up

917
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,380
thank you so much for playing hackers

918
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,540
challenge I promised some more beginner

919
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,579
ones to make a bit easier to begin

920
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,480
um please stick around for closing

921
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
ceremonies we've got some people that

922
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,320
have earned some fabulous prizes and I

923
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,000
really deserve the the Marvel the black

924
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
badges that's coming towards towards

925
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,060
them so

926
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,839
oh one more question

927
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,320
Santiago

928
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,839
can you mind talking about the JWT part

929
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,020
2

930
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,380
.

931
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,920
which one I'm particularly thinking

932
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,980
about

933
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:43,140
yeah that that's so the

934
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,660
yeah this is very straightforward

935
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,700
basically the easiest way to solve this

936
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
is with

937
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
um

938
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,800
there is a plugin for Portugues uh Pro

939
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,140
and it does it I think it's called key

940
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,940
exclusion

941
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,760
and it just sets the the algorithm to

942
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,780
none

943
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,940
and you just remove the signature

944
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,140
yes

945
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,118
yes

946
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,339
yeah

947
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,339
yeah

948
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,000
thank you everyone for playing hackers

949
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,980
challenge I will be back next year and

950
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,480
we will have a slew of awesome puzzles

951
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,220
for you to enjoy thank you rigel thank

952
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,320
