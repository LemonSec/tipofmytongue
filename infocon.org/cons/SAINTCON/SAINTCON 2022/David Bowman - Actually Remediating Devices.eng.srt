1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
name's David I go by Holly hacker on the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,540
Discord and I'm pretty active in there

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,919
I will tell you guys I really like

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,019
talking just to listen to myself talk so

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,780
please interrupt me or else will not

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,980
talk about anything that I actually

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,599
wrote down beforehand

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,779
but um David that just went before me

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,400
probably could have not set it up better

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,820
A lot of what he was describing and how

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,740
what it looks like and what you got to

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,800
do is kind of the situation I got into

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
about two and a half years ago and said

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
okay how are we going to go about

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,880
actually being agents of change and kind

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,340
of changing these things I do have some

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,079
mini badges to give away for folks that

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,719
participate or want some mini badges so

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,879
participate right

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,440
um just to give you some background the

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,780
network I'm working on and you know the

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
scope of the system 75 000 Chromebooks

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
Apple devices Windows devices 65

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,420
locations some innumerable amount of

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,219
personal devices that

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,600
get connected to things that are not

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
supposed to be connected to that I can't

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,979
stop so that's kind of the scope of what

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm trying to figure out here and as

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,939
we've gone through that

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,100
um so

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,260
um I wanted to start with a little bit

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,080
of a game here so this is kind of what

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
my daily basis is looks like when we

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,900
start trying to remediate things so I've

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,439
got two example devices here

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,900
um what what can you tell me about these

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,979
devices

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,080
any guesses or what you can tell me

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,679
about these things

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,440
great yeah so

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
you just described what took me four

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
months to figure out what I could learn

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,379
from this so I really appreciate that

45
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,060
um just a little bit of a recap here

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,220
right um something I didn't know a

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,080
couple years ago is Mac addresses have

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,599
kind of standardized format So based on

49
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,319
the four the first two I guess they're

50
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,140
not octets but the first the first four

51
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,780
characters they're actually a model

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,720
identifier oftentimes or a manufacturer

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,099
identifier so you can tell if

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,440
something's like HP or apple or Dell

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,720
until Apple introduced Mac address

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,760
randomization and now it's a little more

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,220
complicated super useful if you want to

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,019
do things like Bach Alexa on your

59
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,180
network or other video game consoles

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,879
because they do have an identifiable Mac

61
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,160
address range so that's another little

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,400
tip on how to block those to use that

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,080
from an IP address perspective if you've

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,379
got like a super awesome cool Network

65
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,760
where you've got segmentation this can

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,220
tell you some things right device naming

67
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,379
this can tell you some things and all

68
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,540
ultimately when we start talking about

69
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,000
trying to remediate devices I'm

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
primarily talking about you know

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,260
endpoint devices and what those things

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,180
look like and these are the types of

73
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
things that was the data we sat down to

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,680
look at to figure out okay how are we

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
gonna how are we gonna get from point A

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,900
of knowing it's an issue to point B of

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,659
actually doing something about it

78
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,420
um so just

79
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
um this just essentially kind of what I

80
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,540
was talking about where there's a vendor

81
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,760
code this was something I didn't know

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,379
that was super cool for me to kind of

83
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,080
learn and figure out

84
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,120
and now as I've gotten used to it it

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,060
makes it a little bit easier so when I'm

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,920
looking at my firewall traffic and go oh

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,260
that's what kind of device that is and

88
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,459
maybe it's really geeky to start

89
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,400
memorizing like vendor codes for Mac

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,519
addresses but I mean that's kind of the

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,379
uh that's kind of how I've started to

92
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,420
roll to help find those things and then

93
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,040
teach my folks who are working on

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,659
remediating these devices how to use

95
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,879
that information

96
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,140
so if I take you back in time a little

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,840
bit about two years ago we ran a pen

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
test and learned a whole lot from that

99
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,940
and one of the things they learned from

100
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,320
that is that they needed a security

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,780
manager so that created my job which I

102
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,639
really appreciate

103
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,259
um and then it created a bunch of kind

104
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,020
of paranoia and so a whole bunch of

105
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,240
money got thrown at it and so we bought

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,699
a whole bunch of things and we bought a

107
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,040
Sim and we did a bunch of firewall

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,660
projects and we hired our security

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,139
manager and we did new anti-virus and we

110
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,780
did all of these things and then about a

111
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,639
year into it

112
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,100
it was like whoa what are we doing

113
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,220
like how is this stuff actually helping

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,020
us succeed

115
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,199
um so sometimes we talk about these

116
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,699
business events or a breach or something

117
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,020
that happens and finally you get that

118
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,100
money you've been waiting for forever

119
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,080
and we just started spending the money

120
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
you got to stop before you do that and I

121
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
realize it's rare for a school district

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
to be like hey I got a bunch of money

123
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,639
and I started spending it and this was

124
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,139
covid and the government was just kind

125
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,220
of throwing money out at school

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,840
districts but

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,620
um

128
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,500
the other piece too is we thought that

129
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,180
we had good enough executive buy-in

130
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,500
because they were giving us money right

131
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,199
Like Money Talks ultimately that's where

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,820
we're going there

133
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,840
um but we didn't necessarily get the

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,419
buy-in we thought we needed so we went

135
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,900
through some steps so

136
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,600
based on kind of what we've mentioned a

137
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,940
little bit so far

138
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,680
um

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,419
how hard do you think this is going to

140
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,580
be right it's a huge Network right how

141
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,720
long do you think it would take to

142
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,740
remediate the devices

143
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,840
okay so with an MDM that could speed up

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,000
that process

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,039
um how efficient is your MDM do you

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,699
measure that

147
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
yeah it's hit and miss right so MDM was

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,020
a big piece of that we do have an MDM

149
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,419
and one of the things that we did is

150
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,220
there was a big focus on getting things

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,460
in the MDM until I started to measure it

152
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,560
and realize maybe the MDM is getting me

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,979
to about 60 70 compliance so that's a

154
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,080
huge help on the network

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
and then you end up kind of figuring out

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
okay every idea I come up with is not

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,319
going to be perfect I don't have a

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,580
silver bullet

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,160
and so I end up kind of having to figure

160
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,180
out what's going to be the most

161
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,039
important to me right because the pen

162
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,259
test and other tools giving this huge

163
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,479
list of things that I needed to work on

164
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,780
or do and

165
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,419
so I had all these different ideas about

166
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,520
what we were going to do first and super

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
excited and here's all the things we

168
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
need to do so which one of these do you

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,440
think I ended up picking first

170
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
all of them right I mean this was the

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,199
problem right I was starting to look

172
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,240
like Dwight in my office with the okay

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
like they're like all right David let's

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
not have you be a chainsaw could you

175
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,539
maybe be a weed whacker right because I

176
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,780
was just ready to go right

177
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,639
um so one of the things that eventually

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,220
occurred to me and you really hit it and

179
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,780
I have to admit eventually there were

180
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,160
six months of trying to do it all at

181
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,780
once

182
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,360
um the MDM became my biggest priority

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,620
because what can I do with the MDM

184
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,960
I can do I can push out the rest I can

185
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,620
do the AV I can do I can do the OS I can

186
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,960
inventory it like I could do all those

187
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,440
things so my focus became all right

188
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,660
stuff's got to get in the MDM

189
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,280
and

190
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,039
there's tricks to that right but you

191
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,340
know the worst one is the the expense

192
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,199
card where people just go oh hey I need

193
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,900
to buy a I need to buy a new Macbook and

194
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,220
I'm not going to wait for you to order

195
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,599
it and so

196
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,800
I

197
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,900
how many of you have more than 10 000

198
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,639
devices named MacBook Air on your

199
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,940
network right like or iPhone right like

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,699
there's just and so one of the things we

201
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,699
did is we established a budget priority

202
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,099
for MDM licensing

203
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,620
so instead of screaming at everybody to

204
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,660
stop buying devices which we still kept

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,599
doing but since we couldn't stop it the

206
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,819
rule became all right fine you have to

207
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,099
let us put the management software on it

208
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,379
and don't do that again not a not a user

209
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,479
but at least by putting the management

210
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,879
license on it we started to get

211
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,919
somewhere so I took some of the budget

212
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,958
that we were spending or would have

213
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,520
spent on some of these security tools

214
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,059
and invested it in our licensing and so

215
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,760
my Apple yeah

216
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,599
no you're good

217
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,580
um when you create that product that

218
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,160
forces that compliance please call me

219
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,360
yeah

220
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
um so sorry the question was do you have

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
a way on the network that you enforce

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,540
this type of compliance where you can't

223
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,019
just bring devices to it if you could

224
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,940
invent an automated product for me for

225
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,760
that great please call me and when I ran

226
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,700
smaller networks that if that was a

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,959
baited question because you're a vendor

228
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,300
I really will talk to you after please

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,260
um but

230
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,200
in a smaller Network

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,959
you can get you can get that granular

232
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,959
and start controlling things with

233
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,880
um with MAC address filtering or access

234
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
tables I've even experimented a little

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,459
bit with

236
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,360
certificate-based authentication on the

237
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,339
Wi-Fi right so there is no username and

238
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,980
password you can share with each other

239
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,120
but then you get into the business of

240
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,480
managing certification asserts and

241
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,459
yeah I'll jump off the stage here if we

242
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,100
talk about that too much but so there

243
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,500
are ways in a smaller Network in my

244
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
world it just wasn't feasible to force

245
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,320
it one way we do control it a little bit

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,779
is any licensed software

247
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,160
I took away the installers or the

248
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,560
automated things that my end my end

249
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,660
technicians were using for some of them

250
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
so you had to come through my system

251
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,459
admin team or through a distribution

252
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,339
process to get that license software

253
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,380
and I didn't give them the license

254
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,760
software unless it was in the management

255
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,040
system so you don't get the

256
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,899
now it's still there the guys on my

257
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,700
staff sit in the back are going that

258
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,760
still exists but like the I paired down

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,800
the amount of just you know the I.T

260
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,600
share drive with all the installers on

261
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,820
it because that was a way to drive

262
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,740
adoption

263
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,860
um so that helped the other thing that

264
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,079
makes a big difference too is because of

265
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,440
our content filter and our 8021x

266
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
authentication with the certificate

267
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,760
changing every year the users who refuse

268
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,680
to let us get them enrolled in the MDM

269
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,660
have definitely learned that it's

270
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,660
painful and so we've created some pain

271
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,560
for those that refuse to let us but it

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,360
wasn't anything I D directly did sorry

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
the world changed I can't get a security

274
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,079
cert longer than a year it's not my

275
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,560
fault so I don't get the political blame

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,940
for it it's just this thing I have to

277
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,800
make work better and it's like all right

278
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,380
well if you'll let us put it in the MDM

279
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,120
and so that's kind of what we looked at

280
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,060
I mean from a results perspective

281
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,800
two and a half years ago I had about six

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,459
thousand devices in my Apple MDM and I

283
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,040
have 11 500 now

284
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
and so to me that's a huge win like I'm

285
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
super excited about that and the Apple I

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,640
know I'd rather just throw them all out

287
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,480
let's be clear but the but that has

288
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,279
helped us so much as we've gone through

289
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,560
search changes or we're deploying a new

290
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,540
AV or whatever the thing is that we're

291
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,279
doing because it's in that management

292
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
system we've been able to be a lot more

293
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,880
successful with it

294
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,740
um

295
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,459
so we were looking for low-hanging fruit

296
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,880
type things and we had had this thing

297
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
around for

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,920
many many years before I got there that

299
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,540
there was a way that devices were

300
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,420
supposed to be named like we named them

301
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,660
with like a location code and an asset

302
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,540
tag number and so these were supposed to

303
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
be super helpful for us to know where

304
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,459
devices were but of course what devices

305
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,680
are not compliant with that the ones

306
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,240
that are coming in from Best Buy or

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,579
wherever else they're coming in from but

308
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,459
what rule do I have if it's going in the

309
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,820
MDM I'm not putting in the MDM until you

310
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,019
fix the naming convention right and so

311
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,360
this I don't know if I realized how

312
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,920
I don't know if I realized how important

313
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,660
the MDM became in this process until I

314
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,519
started just now sorry having an

315
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,019
epiphany here

316
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,139
um but as we establish those rules that

317
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,480
helped us begin to drive that and now

318
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,000
for a lot of my devices on the network

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,519
or in my firewall traffic or am I Sim or

320
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,800
wherever I'm looking at it I can tell

321
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
you this is where

322
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
this device is located

323
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,399
or

324
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,100
how many how many of you try to filter

325
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,959
off of your remediation List personal

326
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,500
devices

327
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,500
right we all try to do it has anybody

328
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,880
found a super effective way to do it

329
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,019
okay and so you've used some domain

330
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,839
certificate enforcement and so that

331
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,420
really begins to help with that one of

332
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,339
the things that we were able to figure

333
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,200
out is because we had to established

334
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,019
this naming convention when I get a dump

335
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,899
out of a log or a scanner that says okay

336
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,459
here's all the devices on the network

337
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,320
and I need to find the ones that I want

338
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,680
to work on I can now look for only

339
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,320
devices that have a three digit code

340
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
with a hyphen at the beginning of their

341
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,920
name and now all of a sudden I'm

342
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,740
scraping out now I'm potentially losing

343
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,380
the non-managed devices in here but I'm

344
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,200
now identifying stuff that has been

345
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,899
named properly that I potentially know

346
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,700
some more about because it has an asset

347
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,339
tag or a location information and so we

348
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,860
started to sort things by that and then

349
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
all of a sudden now I could generate a

350
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,000
to-do list

351
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,980
for people responsible for different

352
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,180
locations

353
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,300
because I could generate hey this is

354
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,620
where it's at based on the naming

355
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,779
conventions

356
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,240
so I also

357
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,079
um

358
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,320
we had about 60 compliance on that when

359
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,699
I looked at it

360
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:45,420
um

361
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,220
I haven't gotten a chance to really

362
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,220
measure this yet but I know that it just

363
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,959
doesn't it just doesn't go in the MDM

364
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,959
anymore without a proper name and if we

365
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,240
find them we send them back and make

366
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,160
them rename them and that causes some

367
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,860
user frustration but it's user

368
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,139
frustration with our own I.T staff and

369
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,120
so we get to have the put on your big

370
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
boy pants it's your job instead of

371
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,740
arguing with the user about what that

372
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,420
what that difference is until you have

373
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,920
to reboot the machine to rename it and

374
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,959
close their 100 Chrome tabs because

375
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,440
that's all something that

376
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,519
um

377
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,839
so

378
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,540
one of the cool things that existed that

379
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,880
my network team needs huge props for is

380
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,699
the network segmentation that existed in

381
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,980
place that we had naturally built as we

382
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,540
went along

383
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,399
um so that was something that existed

384
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,720
and was there and that became a huge

385
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,899
source of information for us to also be

386
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,860
able to add one more piece of the pie

387
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,079
right so now I can look at the naming

388
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,940
convention I can look at the MAC address

389
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,880
I can look at the IP address and know

390
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
like this is where it is and no those

391
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,959
are not my actual subnets give me some

392
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,019
credit right like I do rise the security

393
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,199
conference I'm not drawing you a map but

394
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,139
um this segmentation also made it so

395
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,839
that I could start and we're still

396
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
working on this and now that's big level

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,459
stuff as I call it not endpoint right

398
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,920
but now we can start doing things like

399
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,260
East-West rules and application rules

400
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,600
about flowing from one place to another

401
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,899
in VPN limitations and

402
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,180
but you got to start at that fundamental

403
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,800
level so that Network segmentation

404
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,860
became a big deal and even to migrate to

405
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,500
that right we had to establish the vpa

406
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,920
or the VLAN and build that segmentation

407
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,500
right so each location has a segment and

408
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
then we've got a set of standardized

409
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,880
vlans and then all the devices aren't

410
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,680
magically on there right but as we run

411
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,240
across them

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,699
we help move them to where they belong

413
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,800
or then when we start blocking certain

414
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
applications in the firewall from

415
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,779
certain vlans uh oh this badge reader

416
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,519
quit working or this camera quit working

417
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,920
why because you didn't have it where it

418
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,959
belonged right so let's fix it

419
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,599
um one of the other things too that

420
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,240
helped us just with some Clues where we

421
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,799
were looking for these things and trying

422
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,500
to determine unnamed devices that aren't

423
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,240
following this the string of things

424
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,980
right when you do inventory scans

425
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,619
um we have we started using an AV called

426
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,179
Trend Micro and one of the things they

427
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,700
had was a discovery tool that would scan

428
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,160
our Network and say Here's the list of

429
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,039
the devices that we see on the network

430
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,419
that we want you to install a product on

431
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,740
right because they want to help you

432
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,020
install their product right but it

433
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,059
started giving us device names that we

434
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,000
could then cross-reference in to our

435
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
computer objects and active directory

436
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,880
and go hey what do we know about this

437
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,679
right because if I start tying down

438
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,160
usernames or what oh you I had put it in

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,340
for various reasons

440
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,020
um at some given point when it was

441
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,059
configured when they joined the domain

442
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,260
they needed blah blah blah blah blah

443
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,299
blah they didn't name the device right

444
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,280
but now I can cross-reference that back

445
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,039
and deal with Device renaming and so

446
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,100
that was another place that um

447
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,720
that was another place that helped us

448
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,700
learn some data

449
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,380
um with all those pieces together

450
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
I can totally tell you we're

451
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,539
at work right like

452
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,080
um what we identified as would be

453
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,840
multi-year project and really still is

454
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,620
is this concept of if we establish these

455
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,419
regular norms and those little rules

456
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,320
become enforced it's successful and so

457
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,480
when I can say things like okay the MDM

458
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,220
had this many and now has this many

459
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,360
right okay or I had this many this was a

460
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,559
fun one when we went to change

461
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,020
antiviruses we didn't really know how

462
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,940
many devices we had when we bought it

463
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,179
and so we kind of guessed and then when

464
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,760
it came up time for Renewal I had over

465
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,720
guessed by like 5 000 devices and so I

466
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,520
saved some money just by actually doing

467
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,120
how many computers I had right but you

468
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,860
know Ron Swanson really does have a good

469
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,620
point right since this Project's never

470
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,000
going to end

471
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,740
we're a government entities so we can

472
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,059
get away with this right but we're not

473
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,559
getting fired based on the bottom line

474
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,720
right so we're just going to keep saying

475
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,640
it works and if anybody asks you it

476
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,299
works really good

477
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,419
um

478
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,120
so thinking through the next step of

479
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,679
kind of we identified those things those

480
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,919
were processes as once we were focusing

481
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,020
on the MDM and the naming conventions we

482
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,880
said okay

483
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,919
we want the anti-virus to really start

484
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,580
helping us pay attention to these things

485
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,500
we made a significant change in what we

486
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,299
were doing with our antivirus so we

487
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,440
changed providers and we went to a level

488
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,200
of

489
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,039
antivirus that could give us a little

490
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,380
better reporting about what kind of

491
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,539
compliance there was

492
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,000
um what's interesting about this is that

493
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
we really had a lot of devices that were

494
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
not

495
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,039
um they weren't in complaints even when

496
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,559
we had it which led us to go well if I'm

497
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,179
buying an antivirus and putting it on

498
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,860
there and it's not updating or ever

499
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,299
communicating again

500
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,179
why am I putting it there

501
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,480
right like I know it's a problem and so

502
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,520
we had to look at that prioritization

503
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
and its ability to be persistent and

504
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,960
check in and be friendly with MDM

505
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,000
deployment policies or group policies

506
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,480
that check if that's installed that kind

507
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,360
of invented what is I think it's beloved

508
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,240
others probably do not but we call it

509
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,000
the master remediation sheet and so we

510
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,620
started out on our Master remediation

511
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,960
sheet with okay we're going to fix

512
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,980
anti-virus and so every of the entire

513
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,020
I.T staff all the building technicians

514
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,179
Network staff system admin staff

515
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,720
everybody had lists of things that they

516
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
could impact or pieces that they could

517
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,100
do to help make these things happen and

518
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,260
it became a checklist and we put it in a

519
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,900
giant Google sheet because we're cheap

520
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,640
and I don't have some fancy software for

521
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,380
this right we put it in a giant Google

522
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,000
sheet and we just started tracking it

523
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,820
and checking them off and you know doing

524
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,799
call outs and little awesome you get a

525
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,260
gold star for folks that were extra

526
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,020
focused on getting it taken care of so

527
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,820
as we did that the remediation sheet

528
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,100
kind of became this thing that started

529
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,299
to grow and if we go back to my previous

530
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,840
point about you had to pick a priority

531
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
um all of a sudden I had one tab two

532
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,700
tabs three tabs four tabs we got to like

533
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,580
seven tabs on the remediation sheet and

534
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,559
it became very clear

535
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,720
that there was some folks who were

536
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
invested in this and working on it and

537
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,220
working to remediate the devices that

538
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,620
they had a circle of influence over and

539
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,539
some folks that were not and so that

540
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,100
actually helped us from a performance

541
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
and measurement perspective from a staff

542
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,039
perspective

543
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,880
of a way to help measuring coach folks

544
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,460
on in on what their roles are and how we

545
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,940
can improve stuff on those devices

546
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,500
um

547
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,500
then once we started kind of working at

548
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,840
that level right then we had to start

549
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,280
working

550
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,960
um

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,000
into things that we could begin to do at

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,980
our larger staff groups right or our

553
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,940
more advanced proficient staff groups so

554
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,600
um

555
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
it's the network I'm just telling you

556
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,559
right now I manage the sysadmin so it's

557
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,120
all the network

558
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,820
and yeah well if no or someone can yell

559
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,000
it's DNS that's fine whatever but right

560
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
so this is the problem right it's always

561
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,900
it's one thing's followed or the other

562
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,600
thing's fault and so what we've worked

563
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,120
on establishing except for us heckling

564
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,559
each other from the back room right is

565
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,179
it's not the Network's fault it's not

566
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,940
the system's fault it's our fault it's

567
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,520
our problem we have to work on that

568
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,100
um so

569
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,320
the firewall rules we have have been

570
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,880
growing like a astronomical virus that

571
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,860
were just being put there for a really

572
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,600
long time and we've now actually said

573
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
wait a minute we have to kind of stop

574
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,520
and start here and figure out where did

575
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,260
all these rules Come From why are they

576
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,500
there what do they do why does that

577
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,240
particular server have the Windows

578
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,960
Firewall turned off like I think I

579
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,900
remember like we were on a zoom call at

580
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,039
some point and someone wasn't working

581
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,480
and we turned it off because everybody

582
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,760
was screaming and it fixed it and we

583
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,860
forgot to go back and deal with it right

584
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,659
or actually because that's that's a

585
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,100
legitimate troubleshooting technique

586
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,220
right just turn off Fireball right

587
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,659
um just turn off the AV those things

588
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,700
work except oh yeah I'm gonna have to go

589
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,380
back when I've got a maintenance period

590
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,820
and figure out what was actually wrong

591
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,740
right so we started to identify things

592
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,340
like that so that we could work on the

593
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,380
more advanced things if you don't have

594
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,960
an understanding about what things are

595
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,280
happening on your network and what

596
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,840
applications live where when you start

597
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,700
trying to do things like East-West rules

598
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,280
it's going to get ugly and it's going to

599
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,159
get ugly in a hurry and so it's worth

600
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,260
gaining that type of knowledge about

601
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,039
what's going on

602
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,280
um so then

603
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,960
we the network staff's doing a lot of

604
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,880
work our endpoint technicians are doing

605
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,299
a lot of work and the system admins they

606
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,039
also said all right how can we

607
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,900
contribute to this

608
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,460
um I totally would love to have some

609
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,740
budget for a nice fancy active directory

610
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,039
security tool that consistently scans

611
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,340
um I don't so we've sought out and used

612
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,900
free tools

613
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,500
um

614
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,080
uh there's a company called S I think

615
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,580
it's semperis they make a tool called

616
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Purple Knight that does a cool scanning

617
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,659
of your active directory that's free and

618
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,340
it's even free without the sales pitch

619
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,659
we definitely got the sales pitch

620
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,980
because how much we were using the free

621
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,960
tool but it gives you some great best

622
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,580
practices like here are the things that

623
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,500
are problems in your active directory

624
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,059
that you should maybe fix and here's a

625
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,580
link to an article on how to deal with

626
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,000
it then we found some

627
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,799
oh I can't remember the name of the tool

628
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,760
now

629
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,799
um we've been using a tool that will

630
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,320
read the ad hashes and tell us like oh

631
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,200
hey these 6 000 users have the same

632
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,539
password right or their password has not

633
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,020
been changed in 90 days or 180 days or

634
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,000
yeah let's pretend all all my passwords

635
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,100
are not older than that

636
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,559
but as we've had that that helped us to

637
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,240
know we could answer management

638
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,159
questions on like hey we want to change

639
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,279
the password policy and increase the

640
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,779
length and then the management question

641
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,640
is like how many people is that going to

642
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,480
impact

643
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,620
well

644
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
everyone

645
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,240
or now I could give him data that said

646
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,299
okay we have a hundred thousand users in

647
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,760
the domain and

648
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,220
60 000 of them have a password that

649
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,440
doesn't meet these requirements and so

650
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,779
it's only going to impact sixty thousand

651
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,260
right that sounds like low impact right

652
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,360
um so that was the type of thing where

653
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,820
when we could put that business-like

654
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,980
data because of the information we were

655
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,380
gathering to answer the business

656
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,419
decision maker questions about what's

657
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,620
going to happen when you press that

658
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,140
button that helped increase some of our

659
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,679
executive buy-in on okay I actually

660
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,000
believe you guys know what's going to

661
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,980
happen when you press this button and

662
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,840
it's not going to break everything and

663
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,039
I'm not going to get a whole bunch of

664
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,260
phone calls from the teachers or the

665
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,760
public saying oh my gosh you broke it

666
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,919
and I can't teach right

667
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,919
um

668
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,720
we you know this seems like a silly

669
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,640
thing but

670
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,179
um

671
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,039
password policies who likes password

672
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,779
policies people excited about that

673
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,039
okay somebody was almost fell out of

674
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,600
their chair there so we do have somebody

675
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,779
super excited about password policies so

676
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,620
tell me what's the right password policy

677
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,200
long

678
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,080
it depends on your environment how often

679
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
should you change them

680
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,779
keep them long change them often it's

681
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,120
like underwear right what about special

682
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,980
characters

683
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,440
right like there's a whole bunch of

684
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,659
opinions out there about what it looks

685
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,400
like if you're trying to convince users

686
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,799
to change it if I have to teach my user

687
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,520
okay uppercase lowercase special symbol

688
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,159
Haiku right like if I have to teach them

689
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,500
all of that stuff guess what I don't

690
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,340
know anything to do with your new

691
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,580
password policy I I need to resist this

692
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,340
and so we said we kind of picked it and

693
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,799
said you know what length is the thing

694
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,559
that can make the biggest impact so

695
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,500
we're just going to go after length

696
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,539
and then we were able to slide in oh

697
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,340
yeah if it's a known breached password

698
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,980
then can't use that one either

699
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,260
um and so we take this and we I wrote I

700
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,179
wrote up this oh Page Long document

701
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,039
about this is why we want to do this and

702
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,360
that's why when I do this and give them

703
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,860
to them and they're like

704
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,840
right so I read your document but I'm

705
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,740
not

706
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,740
totally clear on what you want here

707
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,480
right because you've given me this this

708
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,039
sound impacts this group and this group

709
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,039
and this group and I realized that we

710
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,960
didn't have enough pictures for the

711
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,179
business people

712
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:22,140
to help sell this concept so one of uh

713
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,360
one of my guys went and just got one of

714
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,400
those charts that says okay when it's

715
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,320
six characters long this is how fast I

716
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
can crack it and eight characters and 12

717
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,279
and just put that on the report and they

718
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,640
went oh we get it now okay we can do

719
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,279
this so then this was one of my favorite

720
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,080
experiences of actually getting some

721
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,580
executive buy-in

722
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,640
but we teach kids right so why have kids

723
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,340
all the way from five to six years old

724
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,500
all the way into 1819 in school so if I

725
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,179
tell you

726
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,059
your kindergartner now needs to remember

727
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,860
a 10-digit password how do you feel

728
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,219
about that

729
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,220
good luck okay what do you think my

730
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,659
kindergarten teacher said to that

731
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,820
we're calling the union right forget it

732
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,299
this is not happening right so guess

733
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,760
what my kindergartners

734
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,159
have

735
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,419
a length and password requirement

736
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,179
and we made a curriculum level argument

737
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,720
about it if I'm preparing students to be

738
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,580
prepared for the real world

739
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,039
and this is what passwords need to be

740
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,200
aren't I responsible to teach digital

741
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,760
literacy

742
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,159
don't I actually need to start teaching

743
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,020
them even when they're that young that

744
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,000
this is what a password secure password

745
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,860
should be

746
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,159
so we want it from a curriculum-based

747
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,159
our Duty or stewardship perspective

748
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,260
is a totally different way to go about a

749
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,640
password policy

750
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,399
and then some of the the cabinet level

751
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,740
Executives said okay we're still going

752
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,100
to get a lot of complaints about this so

753
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,620
change our passwords first

754
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,600
so that we can deal with that pain and

755
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,640
then we can we can empathize and say

756
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,460
yeah we know it's a pain but we did it

757
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,679
too and it's okay digital literacy you

758
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:17,940
should be able to teach your kids how to

759
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,539
do it and I we got approval from cabinet

760
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,760
said okay we can do it and we got to go

761
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,039
change kindergartner level passwords to

762
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,140
a lengthened requirement they're not all

763
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,020
the same password they're all unique and

764
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,820
the teacher has a way to know how to

765
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,080
help them

766
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,260
without printing out the passwords and

767
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,960
guess what it does not take your entire

768
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,520
class period to help all your kids log

769
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,399
into a Chromebook would you believe that

770
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,380
because I bet if beforehand you would

771
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,419
have thought it did but then we learned

772
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,520
little things that helped like by

773
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,380
default on our Chromebook logins the

774
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,320
student was typing in their their

775
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,059
beginning of their email address in the

776
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,100
domain we realized that there was a

777
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,559
setting in the GAC that could just

778
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,620
automatically populate the domain name

779
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,600
so now the student only had to type in

780
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,140
five characters instead of 14 right and

781
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,240
we we began to try to approach that from

782
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,520
the behavior perspective and we got to

783
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,340
implement a new password policy and then

784
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,919
because we have our looping background

785
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,960
after two years pen test

786
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,899
next week we got to finally drop the

787
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,940
hammer on all the password policies we

788
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,320
tried to apply and gave everybody and

789
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
their brother time and education to

790
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,340
change where I just went in and reset

791
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,960
everybody's password who hasn't fixed it

792
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,419
in the last two years so now I will be

793
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:40,200
clean for the pen test but that is how

794
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,539
we kind of built those the guys in the

795
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,980
back row were laughing at me about the

796
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,140
making the statement we will be clean

797
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,539
um but that's how we started to make

798
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,299
some of those wins by dividing those

799
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,140
things out into those little chunks

800
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,940
um what about you folks what have you

801
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,740
done to be successful in implementing

802
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,659
password policies right we all fight

803
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,220
about these what's worked for you guys

804
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,779
okay

805
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,700
summer we've made them all I think 15

806
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,820
plus characters and we use single sign

807
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,418
on the flashlight

808
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,580
cool so just for purposes of recording

809
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,500
hopefully I recurgitate this properly

810
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,380
but you had some small events tied

811
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,840
around poor password policies and you

812
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,820
were able to use that with management to

813
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,520
have some discussion about we need to

814
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,159
potentially change this so that helped

815
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,480
us Implement some complexity

816
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,700
requirements but then you introduce

817
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,640
things like single sign-on and you say

818
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,440
like tapping badges

819
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,360
or I'm not familiar with these so this

820
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
is okay like a QR code that can help

821
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,120
them do that right so we've sought ways

822
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,240
that it could be easier for users but

823
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,460
also be compliant with the password

824
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,260
policy right because when we start

825
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,580
talking about password policies

826
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,740
everybody everybody thinks we're Hulk

827
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,659
showing up going okay change password

828
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,440
right and but you you attached it to

829
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,720
behavior in an ease of use method so

830
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
that's great any other good suggestions

831
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,059
on that

832
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,220
okay cool three words instead of

833
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,140
focusing on the number I'm starting to

834
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,840
teach the passphrase concept I love it I

835
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
like that that's great

836
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,260
uh at a past

837
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,580
so my boss just literally sat down

838
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,440
figured out the

839
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,240
monetary cost of

840
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,060
[Music]

841
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
um

842
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:27,899
okay yeah so that using a direct cost

843
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,599
model to drive those things right

844
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,580
sometimes I think as I.T people we have

845
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,980
a tendency to we miss some of that

846
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,139
business side of it or like the

847
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,899
spreadsheet justification for that but

848
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,879
taking something like PCI compliance and

849
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,260
saying all right this is what the find

850
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,540
would be if you don't do it and this is

851
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,280
what it would cost all of a sudden

852
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,560
someone that's actually got the approve

853
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,260
button has got some good motivational

854
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,080
understanding of what the financial

855
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,900
impact of ignoring you is right

856
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,640
because does anyone feel like they get

857
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,520
paid to yell into the void

858
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,920
right like I mean that's why you come

859
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,359
and volunteer to speak at Saint con

860
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,859
because then those are the people give

861
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,800
you feedback like you're not crazy right

862
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,480
like we do at least identify with what's

863
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
happening to you

864
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,940
um

865
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,880
yeah right

866
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,320
but so I mean as we go through those

867
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,640
things these are the type of things

868
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,800
where it's useful to have those

869
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,020
conversations and for me and my career

870
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,160
one of the things that I found has

871
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,079
helped when I'm talking through Concepts

872
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,619
like this is to be able to utilize

873
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,940
my networks right in terms of hey if I

874
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,619
go in the same con Discord and say

875
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,200
what's been your success or failed

876
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,760
success in implementing a password

877
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,140
policy and how did you do it or hey I'm

878
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,420
Doing Network segmentation and I'm a

879
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,640
little bit lost right I mean it's great

880
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,980
when I can afford to have vendors come

881
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,660
in and like help me with that stuff but

882
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,880
guess what I need it free from the

883
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,520
community I'm a poor School District

884
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,680
right so I need that help and that's

885
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,680
that can be a really big deal

886
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,480
um

887
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,579
so as we've gone through that process

888
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,740
and we've gone through these things a

889
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,839
little bet came up I mentioned we're

890
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,880
doing our pen test next week a little

891
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,820
back came up about what the score would

892
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,839
be

893
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,420
on the next pen test right because my

894
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,160
job was created from it right so I'm

895
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,920
thinking well if we do worse right it's

896
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,560
not like there's been less viruses and

897
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,660
exploits in the last two years what if

898
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,300
we do worse am I gonna fire me right

899
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,339
like I mean how many csos get walked out

900
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,440
the door for that stuff right somebody's

901
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,720
head's got to roll is my head Gonna Roll

902
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,760
and Management's feeling like they've

903
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,440
given us a lot of sponsorship and

904
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,940
they've been supporting us and so

905
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,820
they're like hey right we're gonna get a

906
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,640
7 out of 10. and that's a long distance

907
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,920
from where we were to be clear

908
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
um and the management was having this

909
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,020
conversation with with a couple of the

910
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,940
managers over the Departments and we all

911
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,560
just started laughing

912
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,119
because they were like

913
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,280
um we're like yeah if we get the same

914
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,180
score or maybe one better we'll be happy

915
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,980
and this is one of those things I'm

916
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,240
trying to figure out how to tie to the

917
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,060
business objective so if somebody has

918
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,859
um has some recommendations on that

919
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,839
please volunteer them right that

920
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,119
actually getting the same score is

921
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,280
actually good like we didn't get worse

922
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,079
right we're still educating kids they're

923
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,180
still graduating high school but so then

924
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,460
I got thinking about wait a minute

925
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,800
how do I there's a lot of stuff that

926
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,540
I've learned over the last two and a

927
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,099
half years about how these things work

928
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:41,040
and where my problems are but did I

929
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,500
write that down

930
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,960
anywhere

931
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,480
like I mean everybody I mean all my

932
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,280
people who image computers now know I

933
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,020
will beat them with the computer if they

934
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,640
don't use the right naming convention

935
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,040
but like did I publish an official

936
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,240
document

937
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,020
that said that or hey you know those 150

938
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,400
firewall rules we're trying to figure

939
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,140
out what the heck they are and why they

940
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,220
were put there in the first place

941
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,900
wouldn't it be great if we had

942
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,640
uh a document that told us why they were

943
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,960
there and what the reason was there

944
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,359
beyond the little one sentence we might

945
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,900
have put in when we implemented it so

946
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,040
what I were kind of trying to work on

947
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,420
next and what we're trying to get better

948
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,060
at is documentation and then I'm hoping

949
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,680
that's my pass out of a bad score

950
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,500
because then go here's the risk register

951
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,359
um we know about these things so don't

952
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,599
depreciate my score right that that or a

953
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,359
flat out Brian but maybe we'll do really

954
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,700
well and if we do then they agreed to

955
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,460
send me and the network manager to Def

956
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,680
can Defcon and black hat which is too

957
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,420
expensive and you can't go but if we get

958
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,400
a 7 out of 10 on the pen test then we

959
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,660
can go

960
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,839
um not holding out for that though

961
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,280
but so that's kind of our goal in

962
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,079
working on that so

963
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,060
sorry I'm going to use the network here

964
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,200
but

965
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,720
can y'all folks share with me like how

966
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,280
do you guys do this what's a good way to

967
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,599
do this because this is what I'm trying

968
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,760
to figure out how to do next I haven't

969
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,260
gotten figured out how I'm going to do

970
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,440
it

971
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,680
okay so we're just gonna start writing

972
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,040
crap down and then it's written down

973
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,200
somewhere so we can sleep at night right

974
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,540
I I like that idea and then we're just

975
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,680
going to put it somewhere where we have

976
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,380
no idea where it is okay so I appreciate

977
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,440
that I would argue that that's how we

978
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,420
get the Lego with three pieces and the

979
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,060
board with four right like

980
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,820
um maybe I'm do I am doing documentation

981
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,640
gosh dang it I'm doing that I've got all

982
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,980
kinds of Google documents and random

983
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
things that we printed out off of a

984
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,980
whiteboard the drawer I totally have

985
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,420
documentation that's a good point

986
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,380
exported all of that to a location but

987
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,520
we forgot

988
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,500
so that guy left yep it's hard

989
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,280
it's hard to make it happen if

990
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,480
it is

991
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,339
yeah do any of you have like a

992
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:24,259
documentation person is that their job

993
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,180
I feel like that could be a job I'm not

994
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,940
sure who would take that job but that

995
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,540
could be a job

996
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,560
okay

997
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,780
okay

998
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,560
and then you can plug your inventory

999
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,079
into that entire task

1000
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,300
s that

1001
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,420
uh

1002
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,920
including your policies which enforce

1003
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,599
government to governments upon those

1004
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,280
things in order for you to push those

1005
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,560
further

1006
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,240
further hey it's not me after that it's

1007
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,479
your management

1008
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,579
so we found the guy that writes the

1009
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,700
documentation he's right there right but

1010
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,619
just for repeating of recording purposes

1011
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,619
right so using an I.T service management

1012
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,839
software is that what itsm stands for

1013
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,680
to be

1014
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,839
sure whatever those acronyms can mean

1015
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,420
whatever we want right I mean

1016
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,220
um but yeah so software to help us

1017
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,400
automate that right that

1018
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,560
that's a great idea maybe that's

1019
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,119
something I ought to look at in

1020
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,099
potentially trying to use I mean because

1021
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,140
we have a tendency to just use Google as

1022
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,720
a go-to because we're a Google districts

1023
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,480
right and we use Google Docs but that's

1024
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,099
not the best way to organize things I

1025
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,280
imagine

1026
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,400
engagement tell you why you changed the

1027
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,359
firewall

1028
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,180
right it was a request from John Dill or

1029
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,040
would you know if there's a result of an

1030
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,780
incident

1031
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,640
right and then you don't need a guy who

1032
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,140
does knowledge everybody's doing

1033
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,660
knowledge okay so start to track it

1034
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,700
based on the incident when you change

1035
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,060
something

1036
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,020
okay

1037
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,099
and that feels a little less

1038
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,839
overwhelming the concept of we start

1039
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,400
writing it down as we go then going okay

1040
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,140
documentation right because I'll do a

1041
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,819
follow-up next year and be like how did

1042
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,560
we get to documentation hopefully

1043
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,060
there's enough progress to talk about

1044
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,920
that definitely a half hour not an hour

1045
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,280
though but so do it as you go along that

1046
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,380
works are we doing that guys we've

1047
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,579
started to do a little bit better about

1048
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,680
that right it probably just is an

1049
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,180
unorganized Google Document spread

1050
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,220
across four different places but we're

1051
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,000
getting there right

1052
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,300
they tied it into change management so

1053
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,099
anytime we

1054
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,260
will change a firewall rule or make a

1055
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,200
major change we had to submit a change

1056
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,700
management ticket into the tickets

1057
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,460
go with this

1058
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,339
and we had to have a detailed plan in

1059
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,260
there in the change management of

1060
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,900
exactly what we were changing

1061
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,440
if we had

1062
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,900
and so it was all documented through the

1063
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,940
ticketing software so it was all

1064
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,339
centralized and not that

1065
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,000
okay

1066
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,980
so do you spend a lot of time in

1067
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,819
meetings more than you do making changes

1068
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,859
okay so I mean because that's one of the

1069
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,839
things because I've got awesome staff

1070
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,240
that work for me but I'm the I'm at the

1071
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,560
management level of where it would be

1072
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,720
like okay go approve these changes

1073
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,460
I do still want to work on stuff

1074
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,920
sometimes but if I just that's part of

1075
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,300
my problem with the Change Control thing

1076
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,760
and there's no no documenting the oh

1077
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,280
crap plan is not fair right like the oh

1078
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,140
crap it didn't work plan

1079
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,240
I can't document that ahead of time

1080
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,300
that's not that's no fun right that's

1081
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,359
that's half the job right but that's a

1082
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:51,060
great point right if we can at least if

1083
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,660
we push this button what's gonna happen

1084
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,420
and if what's gonna happen doesn't

1085
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,619
happen

1086
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,000
the way we thought it was how are we

1087
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,440
going to do it

1088
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,260
true story we used to have a shared

1089
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,700
calendar that was called the change

1090
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,500
management calendar and they're like

1091
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,000
this is our change management process

1092
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,560
and I'm like no that's not change

1093
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,540
management process but okay we're gonna

1094
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,460
have we're gonna have a calendar

1095
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,740
out of a joke one day after listening to

1096
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,619
enough complaints I went and renamed the

1097
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,540
change calendar it's now called the

1098
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,460
information systems potential change

1099
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,319
calendar

1100
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,200
and we have figured out that if we put

1101
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,440
something on there with enough notice

1102
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,420
and don't communicate it any other way

1103
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,920
because we never forget to communicate

1104
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,440
properly

1105
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,380
that users or technical impacted users

1106
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,940
will call us and go you're going to do

1107
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,400
what you realize this will do XYZ and

1108
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,599
it's like you know what no I didn't

1109
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,579
realize that right so we've kind of

1110
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,200
started advertising this is the button

1111
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,640
we're going to push but then we had to

1112
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,020
leave it potential because then people

1113
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,579
are like you didn't push the button and

1114
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,319
so now it's the potential change

1115
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,079
calendar

1116
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,660
but so I really appreciate that I that's

1117
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,280
that's something we have to kind of

1118
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,400
continue to figure out and as we grow

1119
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,140
and do that right

1120
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,200
um

1121
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,400
like I mentioned we're getting a pen

1122
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,260
test next week I'm not stressing out

1123
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,520
about this or talking about this every

1124
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
third sentence at all right

1125
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,900
but um

1126
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,359
part of the overall process that we've

1127
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,160
kind of gone around to with these tabs

1128
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,140
on the remediation sheet in each of

1129
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,780
those things if it's been a year and a

1130
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,520
half since I was focusing and pushing

1131
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,260
people on you need to enroll it in the

1132
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,280
MDM

1133
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,880
then I'm behind again already right so

1134
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,339
you have to establish a Cadence

1135
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:41,099
and by I mean you I also mean me because

1136
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,040
I haven't but I know I should establish

1137
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,680
a Cadence on um

1138
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,780
establish a Cadence on how often we're

1139
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,319
going to assess these things to do that

1140
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,660
um I think that's that's the end of what

1141
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,660
I had in terms of prepared content but

1142
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,119
tips questions

1143
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,440
emotional outbursts

1144
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,579
um so we do that on our Network firewall

1145
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,339
and essentially what we've done is when

1146
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,160
we create a rule without telling you too

1147
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,740
much about what firewalls I use but when

1148
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,200
we create a rule we put it in a logging

1149
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,440
mode or an information mode of the rule

1150
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,079
and then we go and start we let it run

1151
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,960
for depending on how much of in a hurry

1152
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,640
or whatever we do it we let it run for a

1153
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,460
week or a day or over a weekend and then

1154
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,859
go okay what things were talking to it

1155
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,040
and why and that has helped us get a

1156
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,339
little better at the oh crap we changed

1157
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,500
that firewall Rule and now nobody can

1158
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,440
get to XYZ right we didn't know so just

1159
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,740
building just building the rule in a

1160
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,440
informational or just building a report

1161
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,260
even that's going to tell you basically

1162
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,880
what the um what the rule does

1163
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,359
um has helped us get a lot better and

1164
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,280
then given us a punch list of like we

1165
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,480
got to go do these things before we

1166
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,940
change this rule now kind of like I

1167
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,140
mentioned at the beginning that's never

1168
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,020
going to be perfect right but that's one

1169
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,940
way in a best practice that a vendor

1170
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,420
taught us that's helped a lot

1171
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,200
anything else

1172
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,940
cool well hey I really appreciate it

1173
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,920
um our antivirus vendor gave us a whole

1174
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,480
stack of many badges they made to hand

1175
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,280
out so if anybody wants a mini badge I

1176
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,200
got a whole pile here it's all assembled

1177
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,760
so you can plug it straight in but

1178
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,560
thanks I really appreciate it and thanks

1179
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,839
for coming to San con

1180
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,859
thank you
