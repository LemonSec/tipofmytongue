8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
calling for a presentation by the way

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,380
um we're gonna have uh people members of

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,660
our women in cyber security joining us

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,060
in our presentation and uh my morning

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,920
this uh this morning was was pretty

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,260
awesome it was kind of like the epitome

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,859
of women in cyber cyber security for me

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,239
so this morning I'm driving here and as

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm driving all of a sudden I get like

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,320
alerts on my phone that there's a

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,120
security possible security incident

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,399
happening right and I'm like racing to

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,840
the conference so I can get here on time

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,120
and I'm like crap so I you know hurry

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,920
and pull over into a grocery store

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,680
parking lot right and I'm like grabbing

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,600
my laptop as fast I can jumping on my

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,579
laptop my team's already on it they're

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,680
looking into what's going on I'm joining

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,379
them to see what's happening luckily you

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,600
know it was a false positive so you know

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,360
that's that's a very good thing but

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,640
foreign

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
but but it made me laugh though because

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,619
I'm sitting here in a shopping mall

33
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,260
parking lot right and I'm wearing a

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,080
dress I have heels on and I'm grabbing

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,580
my laptop and I'm working on a security

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,979
incident I'm like yes this is the

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,500
epitome of women in cyber security right

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,900
here this is This Is How We Do It

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
um and then it was it was awful though

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
there was like a sad part of my story

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,619
because so um I decided you know to

42
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,240
touch up my nails right before I come

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
here because I'm not very girly but I'm

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,479
like oh yeah I'll hurry and get some

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,000
fingernail polish on and as I'm driving

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,159
I'm sure they're gonna dry right because

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,479
you know I got the air conditioning

48
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,640
going and they can dry the 30 minutes as

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,979
I'm driving here but I didn't anticipate

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,180
that I was going to have a cyber

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,320
incident and then I'm going to be

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
pulling over grabbing my laptop and

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
clicking away at like warp speed and so

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
now I have fingernail polish all over my

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,320
laptop chipped fingernails like so

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,060
that's that's the wounds of being a

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,860
woman in cyber security that's that's

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,919
what we have to take on but well we're

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,319
glad to have all of you here so our

60
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,900
presentation is a lead like there is no

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,099
limit

62
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,140
you know and I think all of us deal with

63
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,300
different limitations in our lives right

64
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,280
we're dealing with either limitations

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
with ourselves that we're trying to get

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,260
past limitations perhaps in our work

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,140
limitations in our industry limitations

68
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,300
in the world you know we have to deal

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,360
with a lot nowadays with covid with

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,700
recession with constant cyber security

71
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,400
attacks happening all around us so it

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
feels like our world is very limiting

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,080
and so today we're going to talk to you

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,220
about

75
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,800
different strategies that we have taken

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,660
in order to get past some of those

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,060
limitations and hopefully there's a

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,440
nugget of something that you're going to

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
be able to take some value out of each

80
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,700
of the things that we present on so

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,140
we're going to divide it up we have

82
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,580
different topics that we're going to be

83
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,180
presenting on today now Dr Shalini kasar

84
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,360
she is

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,099
[Music]

86
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,260
all right we're going no

87
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,000
see if I can figure out why

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,220
there we go all right let me just be

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,720
using the keyboard

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,900
um but Dr Shalini kasar she's one of our

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,180
members of our board on women in cyber

92
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,040
security

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,220
she and I and uh Christina belnap Jamie

94
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,980
Hughes and Mark Millen helped found

95
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,080
women in cyber security here for Utah

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
and it's kind of funny because Mark

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,700
Millen our one male member of the board

98
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,280
he reached out to each one of us and

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,900
said hey we really need to encourage

100
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,540
more women in this field and so I think

101
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,739
we should bring a women in cyber

102
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,780
security here I thought I'm like wow

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,860
yeah I guess I probably should have

104
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,620
thought of that and so it's great that

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
he pulled all of us together

106
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,659
and uh Dr K is our current president in

107
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,980
our board

108
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,540
um and she she was hoping she could be

109
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,099
here but unfortunately she wasn't able

110
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,260
to make it down from St George and so

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,060
she has a video just an introduction

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,500
it's kind of short

113
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
um so we're going to just watch that for

114
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,959
just a minute because she wanted to make

115
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,639
sure that she was able to welcome all of

116
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,918
you people here

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
and

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
and see if we can get that

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,220
hi everybody Welcome to saintcon 2022 I

120
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,860
hope you're having a fantastic time and

121
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,360
thank you and Welcome to our

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
presentation here on behalf of the Oasis

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,540
Utah affiliate chapter I just wanted to

124
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,300
say welcome and say sorry I can't be

125
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,340
there but what I thought was just a few

126
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,199
minutes of saying hello and how are you

127
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
and giving a little bit of a background

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,940
of who we are in terms of recess I'm Dr

129
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,759
Shalini kesar I am a professor in cyber

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,340
security at Southern Utah University but

131
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,620
here I'm coming to you as a capacity of

132
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,540
a founding member of visas as well as

133
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,720
the president of vs Utah failure you

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,220
will see the board members and the

135
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,680
founding members in our group here it's

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,780
a fantastic group that we've decided to

137
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,820
get together and create a strong

138
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,340
community in cyber security specifically

139
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,160
in Utah and the fact is that there is a

140
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,919
gap between males and females in this

141
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,440
field so when we talk about visas we're

142
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,120
not just talking about females we are

143
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
talking about male allies we want

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
different kinds of perspectives

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,060
different fields and different Walk of

146
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,039
Life that way you are at whether you're

147
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,539
a senior level or you're just starting

148
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,120
in the career but our goal in visas Utah

149
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,699
is to create a community that is strong

150
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,460
and we can support each other and have

151
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,380
kindness and empathy amongst each other

152
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,840
and help each other as well as

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,160
collaborate

154
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,440
so this is a great presentation but

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,539
welcome again just a little bit about

156
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,180
visas in general if you go on Visa's

157
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,699
website you will see it started back in

158
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,600
2011 by Dr siraj Who actually won this

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,060
as an NSF National Science Foundation

160
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,699
Grant and then it ended up becoming

161
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,460
affiliate chapters all across the globe

162
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,560
not even United States across the globe

163
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,259
so we are fortunate we started recess

164
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,919
Utah back in 2021 so we are still the

165
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,199
new kids in the block but we would love

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,020

know we says women in cyber security you

180
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,380
know it started a ways back um based off

181
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,360
of a National Science Foundation Grant

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,120
and now it's worldwide uh we brought it

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
here to Utah and we want to encourage

184
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759

185
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,520
um to be a part of this and our goal is

186
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,740
to just try and break down barriers help

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,080
support one another help us to grow in

188
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,080
cyber security and just Network and and

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,060
assist one another so there aren't

190
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,280
limitations in our world

191
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,800
and this is the the current board right

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,740
now for women in cyber security so Dr K

193
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,099
who you just saw myself uh Christina

194

belnap she's the ciso of Health Equity

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,259
she was hoping to be here today but she

196
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,819
had something come up and so her

197
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,819
director of fraud investigations Haley

198
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,280

right now I mean Saint Khan Spain I

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,660
don't know what she was thinking but you

203
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,180

Haley

215
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,000
thanks Sherry hello we can't see you

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,039
anyone really in the audience so I'll

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,740
say hello and thanks for having us

218
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,539
um I appreciate everybody not walking

219
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,039
out of the room when you heard that I

220
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,380
was not a cyber security person I am a

221
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,539
fraud person indeed

222
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,399
um so I'm here to talk to you a little

223
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,679
bit about not fraud and not cyber

224
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,580
security but imposter syndrome and I I

225
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,040
thought it was the irony was not lost on

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,140
me for me to come to a cyber security

227
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,500
conference as the fraud person and talk

228
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,959
about anything in general so I'll give

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,459
you a little bit of my background to let

230
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,260
you know why in the world the fraud

231
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,120
department reports up to the soil Health

232
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,200
Equity and how I got here so

233
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,920
um I'll go back to this slide so

234
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
um I've been with Health Equity for just

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,360
over a year and a half prior to that it

236
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
was most of my career in banking so over

237
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,540
20 years in banking and about 19 of

238
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,380
those years in investigations so my team

239
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,519
roughly 2009 time frame when the banking

240
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,560
world was getting hit with dire malware

241
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
if that's familiar to any of you out

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,899
there I got curious and I started asking

243
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,580
questions and I started making friends

244
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,260
with our cyber security operations

245
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,839
center and ended up running our cyber

246
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
fraud program so

247
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,720
um I don't know nearly as much as any of

248
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,360
you do about cyber security but I know

249
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,980
how to shut up and listen and so I've

250
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,779
learned a lot from my colleagues and my

251
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,940
mentors and it's cost me a whole lot of

252
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,360
Dr Pepper and Mountain Dew and Red Bull

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,399
and all the things that keep people

254
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,519
awake doing threat hunts all night but

255
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,120
it's been worth it I've learned a lot

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
and so yeah that's kind of how I ended

257
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,380
up here and how we are affiliated with

258
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,240
whisis and under the ciso at Health

259
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
Equity

260
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,899
so I'm going to talk to you a little bit

261
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,240
about imposter syndrome and again the

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
irony is that I could not be more

263
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,860
authentically presenting imposter

264
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,500
syndrome to you right now if I tried so

265
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,880
knowing that I'm coming to this

266
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
conference with all these very very

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,420
small smart people

268
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,839
um my colleagues my co-presenters

269
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,300
incredibly smart and successful and

270
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,120
well-educated and little piece of

271
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,100
vulnerability about me I never even

272
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,080
finished a college degree I went to

273
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,420
college did all the things first person

274
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,000
in my family to pursue college education

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,940
and then I got pulled into Security in

276
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,560
the banking world and I was like oh cool

277
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,540
I don't have to get pepper sprayed in

278
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,680
the face and I can still do

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,500
investigations so that's kind of how my

280
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,420
career progressed but yeah I stand

281
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,220
alongside these people with multiple

282
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,320
master's degrees and incredibly smart

283
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,660
people and I have to fake it like I know

284
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,940
what I'm talking about so know that

285
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,200
you're not alone when you're feeling

286
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,779
that way if you feel that way and I just

287
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,700
wanted to show a little video know of

288
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,040
when Christina my boss who by the way

289
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
when your sister comes to you and says

290
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,399
hey can you stand in for me you don't

291
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,260
turn that down so just a little piece of

292
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,920
advice for you

293
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,180
it's gonna play

294
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,880
no okay

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,920
come on I I gotta use the Mean Girls

296
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,360
reference when I can use one

297
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,440
okay well we can roll right on past that

298
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,180
if you've seen Mean Girls it's the part

299
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,100
where the girls in the front of the

300
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,899
crowd and the guy in the back's like she

301
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,060
doesn't even go here that's what it

302
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,680
feels like to be the fraud person at a

303
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,060
cyber security conference and just

304
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,440
letting you know

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
so we're talking about imposter syndrome

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
and I think the the biggest thing to

307
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,060
take away from me what I learned in

308
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,800
doing the research and and the coaching

309
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
that I've done around this is that it's

310
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,420
not unique where it feels like a very

311
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,640
um isolating feeling and maybe you feel

312
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,220
like you're alone I went and looked to

313
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,339
some notable names of people who have

314
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,740
struggled with imposter syndrome and was

315
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,940
actually quite surprised

316
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,720
Maya Angelou

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,060
right written 11 books civil rights

318
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,620
activists probably one of the most

319
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,740
notable authors and she struggled with

320
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,600
imposter syndrome

321
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,500
Sonia Sotomayor first Latina on the

322
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,839
Supreme Court Justice right Albert

323
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
Einstein these are all people who have

324
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,959
struggled with imposter syndrome and of

325
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,700
course had to get one in for the pop

326
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,740
culture people out there Lady Gaga even

327
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,200
right

328
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,639
all these people struggle with imposter

329
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,000
syndrome so it's not unique to you in

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,399
your field you based on your gender you

331
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,860
based on your age or your experience in

332
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,320
your field everyone goes through this at

333
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,360
some point

334
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,600
so how do we get through this

335
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,300
um by no means am I an expert on this

336
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,519
these are things that I have found for

337
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,440
me to be helpful in getting through this

338
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,139
and that's recognizing that that

339
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,120
self-talk that you're having is actually

340
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,579
just the Imposter syndrome and it's not

341
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:30,899
actually a reflection of your

342
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,360
capabilities so when you're asking

343
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
yourself that is this it's just luck

344
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,279
right anybody could do this job or like

345
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,740
I tend to be my boss would tell you this

346
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,839
if she was here a perfectionist I'm not

347
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,160
going to make a decision on something or

348
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,980
move forward on something until I have

349
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,959
analyzed everything to death analysis

350
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,660
paralysis that's in probably every one

351
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,180
of my reviews because I tend to be a

352
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,680
perfectionist and wanting things to be

353
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,380
perfect before I execute

354
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,360
um it's not an easy lesson to learn from

355
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,980
and

356
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,620
um it's definitely individual growth but

357
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
you you know definitely can get there

358
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,279
knowing you're not alone that's why I

359
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,560
brought those examples up so people who

360
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,899
are incredibly successful in their

361
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,740
careers still struggle with this in fact

362
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,720
as the study says

363
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,260
roughly 65 percent of professionals have

364
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,440
experienced imposter syndrome 70 75

365
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,660
percent of females have experienced

366
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,519
female Executives excuse me have

367
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,740
experienced imposter syndrome and

368
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,180
interestingly enough less than five

369
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,680
percent of employers address this

370
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,959
so what do we do

371
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,399
um I have a little Post-it note that

372
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,980
sits on my one of my monitors

373
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,440
and I send this to my team on a daily

374
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
basis find the wins whatever the wins

375
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,060
are you need to find the wins and you

376
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,220
need to document them there's loads and

377
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,500
loads of spreadsheets and all kinds of

378
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,060
cute little forms if that's your thing

379
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,519
but write down your wins every day

380
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,620
because you're you're finding them and

381
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,720
you're creating those wins you just it's

382
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,459
hard to remember those sometimes when

383
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,260
you're in the face of so many hurdles

384
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,180
that there are successes that you're

385
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,459
actually making with the strides that

386
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,600
you're taking

387
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
be kind to yourself

388
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,100
there's you know like I said the inner

389
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,600
dialogue we need to change our inner

390
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,279
dialogue with regard to a lot of

391
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,139
different things but particularly in

392
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,339
your professional career when you're

393
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,800
comparing yourself to others you need to

394
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,380
really reflect that your inner dialogue

395
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,380
is what's keeping you at Bay or

396
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,260
potentially holding you back and so you

397
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,000
need to really change that dialogue to

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
be more positive and remove that

399
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,320
self-doubt and the negative self-talk

400
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,260
and then for me what always works is I

401
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,720
talk to my mentor I talk to even a

402
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,519
trusted colleague that's maybe not a

403
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,220
mentor but somebody who's uh input that

404
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,019
I value and there's Integrity in what

405
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,180
they have to say and it's keep me honest

406
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,959
here

407
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,480
and they'll usually say you're dumb

408
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,399
you're being ridiculous and that's kind

409
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,720
of the slap in the face that I need

410
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,820
sometimes right conversely they will

411
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,620
also say yeah you really screwed that up

412
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,600
and then we go back and fix it but

413
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,160
there's got to be some honesty in the

414
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,360
feedback that you're getting otherwise

415
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,740
it's really not worth either of your

416
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,240
time

417
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
and then one of my favorite things one

418
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,860
of my favorite quotes ever and forgive

419
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,199
me for it being a pop culture quote

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,779
um but does anybody know what the

421
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,760
happiest animal on earth is

422
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,420
a goldfish right anyone know why

423
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,160
short memory they have a 10 second

424
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
memory so when you do fail when you feel

425
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,100
like you fail when something didn't work

426
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,320
out the way that you planned it be a

427
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,660
goldfish it's a it's not the end of the

428
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,820
world this is hard one for me to learn

429
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
personally as well because nobody likes

430
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,740
failure failure doesn't feel good but if

431
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,600
you just be a goldfish and forget it and

432
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,779
move on and move toward correction then

433
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,820
that self-doubt that you experience

434
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,380
around that particular situation

435
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,800
hopefully will turn around

436
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,679
any are we doing questions now okay

437
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,179
we'll do questions at the end but thank

438
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,099
you for your time appreciate you uh

439
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,079
indulging me and now Dennis is up

440
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:19,158
[Applause]

441
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,040
well hi everybody I'm Dennis Taggart and

442
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,660
I've got to say it's a super big honor

443
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,839
to be presenting with Haley and Sherry

444
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,840
so honestly when Sherry comes to me and

445
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,340
says do you want to present with me on

446
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,740
something I pretty much just always say

447
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,679
yes because I always learn something

448
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
working with her and I just try to

449
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,820
follow her around she's the most I don't

450
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,559
know where you get all these places to

451
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,539
speak but it's awesome and I I'm just

452
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,880
grateful to be a part of this and I hope

453
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,520
that something I say can be useful

454
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,860
um

455
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,100
oh no

456
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,539
if that is not a sign

457
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,100
so

458
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,700
well let's talk about some stuff

459
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,240
oh we don't need slides so I

460
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,799
I've been in information security since

461
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,320
2013 but it was a long journey to get

462
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,940
there and I wanted to talk about some of

463
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,860
this because Haley started getting into

464
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,220
it too with the Imposter syndrome but I

465
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,460
came from a background not in computer

466
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,280
science or I.T or anything so when I

467
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,160
first stepped into technology I felt

468
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,980
like such a fish out of water like who

469
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,260
am I to be here these people know things

470
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,360
about the way

471
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,600
the world really works and I am just a

472
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,039
liberal arts major

473
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,640
so what my degree is in I studied and

474
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,620
I'm not sure if it's okay I don't know

475
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,320
where that Port is so I'm not gonna

476
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,620
but so when I

477
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,360
went to school I went to the University

478
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,580
of Utah I studied Arabic and Middle

479
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,280
Eastern studies and I wanted to I love

480
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
language Arabic is awesome and I learned

481
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,799
though I'm not even that good at Arabic

482
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
because I never went and lived in the

483
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,039
Middle East so

484
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,679
but just learning the language was

485
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,460
the best journey and whenever I'm

486
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,200
learning languages I find it's the

487
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,120
imprecision of speech that I love

488
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,580
because it's constant problem solving

489
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,419
and that is something that I

490
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,919
okay I'm glad your password's not going

491
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,200
to be up on that I'm gonna look I'm

492
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,140
gonna look over here for a second

493
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,480
so with the language side though I I

494
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,120
loved it but then I got an internship in

495
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,220
a security operations center and the way

496
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,020
that happened was a friend called me I

497
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,260
was out of state and he goes I think you

498
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,760
would do well at this internship why

499
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,820
don't you fly over here and apply and

500
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,100
enter I'll get you an interview and I'm

501
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,880
like

502
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,400
I've never flown to do an interview ever

503
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,539
this is going to be a waste of

504
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,580
everybody's time but it sounded so

505
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,860
exciting and it was security and I would

506
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,840
have loved I mean studying language and

507
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,220
studying Arabic at the time I was

508
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,440
studying it it was lining up for one

509
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,299
particular career path and I was

510
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,860
thinking Security will help with that

511
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,080
path and

512
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,780
I jumped on the opportunity and in the

513
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,520
interview process I remember being asked

514
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,220
several questions that

515
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,880
were hard and what I was wanted to do

516
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,580
was be real in that process and say I

517
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,520
don't know and I didn't know and

518
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,140
hopefully they would have thought I was

519
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
enough

520
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,620
and they did and so I jumped in on the

521
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,620
entry level in us in a sock

522
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,140
I know there's gonna be a lot of you in

523
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,840
different phases of your security career

524
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,600
so what I hope to do my objective is to

525
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,240
show wherever you are there are some

526
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,100
things that have helped me keep

527
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,440
progressing in security that I think

528
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,799
apply I hope it's Universal but we'll

529
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,000
kind of explore that today and maybe

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
some of the feedback you give will say

531
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,320
no that only applied to you

532
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
um

533
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,640
I think that's me hey

534
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
nice

535
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,360
it was funny though

536
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,280
um one other quick story before I move

537
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,539
to the next slide

538
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,039
I

539
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,780
was getting a master's degree in

540
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,940
political science after Arabic because

541
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,559
again I still wasn't sure I was going to

542
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,179
jump two feet in

543
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,280
or head first in the deep end or

544
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,440
anything in cyber security

545
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,020
but I so I was doing this analysis work

546
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,760
in political science international

547
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,700
relations and such and even working on a

548
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,260
masters I was sitting around people who

549
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,419
were barely getting out of

550
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,059
um like their bachelor's or as an

551
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,100
Associates or whatever it was and I

552
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,020
still felt super weak and just

553
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,419
incompetent and I wanted to prove I

554
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,340
could do something and that feeling

555
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,500
though there were several times I would

556
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,320
talk to a mentor

557
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
um I'd say I feel like this I don't know

558
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,240
that I'm enough and

559
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
that person was like you know everyone

560
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,740
can feel like that at some time you can

561
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,140
choose basically to just let that Define

562
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,880
what you're going to do or you can move

563
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,220
forward like it doesn't matter and roll

564
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,980
with the punches and I tried to roll

565
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,020
with the punches I know many times I was

566
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,179
bruised and I did a poor job but

567
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,340
hopefully this pattern I'll lay out well

568
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,260
not rocket science will be helpful

569
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,400
looking if there's any other points

570
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,340
before I move this it's always

571
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
here it is I want you know I want you to

572
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,120
know this too so

573
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,799
Arabic

574
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
to security learning a ton about

575
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
information security in a really short

576
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,159
time wanting to prove myself and then

577
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,780
once I was in security how did I

578
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,659
progress so I was in the sock first just

579
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,780
doing analysis and working graveyards

580
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,179
and then went into an incident responder

581
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,260
role went into pen testing which was

582
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,280
just

583
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,960
that's when I learned to love

584
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,720
application security I mean honestly I

585
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,000
loved that experience spent a few years

586
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,919
in that went into kind of a hybrid

587
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,900
architecture

588
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,780
um all really was on architecture and

589
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,600
design kind of role for security and

590
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,100
then into now I'm an information

591
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
security officer so managing the

592
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,460
security program for one of the business

593
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,419
units and that whole process has taken

594
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,620
it's been about eight years

595
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,419
and in the Box hole in the battle it

596
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,100
felt like I wasn't progressing at all

597
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,919
but now looking back I can say

598
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,200
this has been an amazing journey how can

599
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,659
I piece together what happened that was

600
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,919
successful

601
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,799
so engaging where you are today is the

602
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,900
topic I've been asked to speak on

603
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,559
uh no one's path is exactly the same I

604
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,760
think there's going to be a number of

605
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll actually do a survey in a second

606
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
and we'll get a feel for what it really

607
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,500
is and I'll cover my eyes so I can see

608
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,740
you but uh everyone's going to have a

609
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,659
slightly different path the real Pitfall

610
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,220
is is when you start comparing yourself

611
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,260
on someone else's path and you decide

612
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,940
that you're less than whatever they are

613
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,880
and you stop yourself

614
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,280
um that's what I hope we don't do after

615
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
this

616
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,720
so I really liked Hitchhiker's Guide to

617
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,960
the Galaxy this is super forced so but I

618
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,640
also found out that 9 plus 10 plus 11

619
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,159
plus 12 equals 42 and that was a that

620
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,280
wasn't a Eureka moment for me and I

621
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,080
thought really

622
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,320
answers to life the universe and

623
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,000
everything at least with professional

624
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,940
development I really think this is

625
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,760
helpful so knowing yourself getting to

626
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,580
work just doing something valuable don't

627
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,840
go off the rails right we'll talk about

628
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,400
the details in a second but getting to

629
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,799
work documenting and Reporting on your

630
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,960
successes and then asking for growth

631
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,780
that's going to help you succeed in

632
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,080
security

633
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,340
and I want to ask actually right now

634
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
um

635
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,179
that's honestly what is let's get a show

636
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,220
of hands right now so how many people

637
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,679
are all is there anyone here that has no

638
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,960
security title but has some security

639
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
responsibilities already or wants more

640
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,940
it's no security title

641
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,400
hey I was hoping there was gonna be some

642
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,780
but I did not know awesome and welcome

643
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,820
um and how many of you are in security

644
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,400
already

645
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,080
and the role you're in is perfect you

646
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,880
never want it to change

647
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,400
foreign

648
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,559
hey nice there's room for all of us to

649
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,000
progress more

650
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,840
and is there any well

651
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,460
really just nobody that cares about

652
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,500
security and just wants to see weirdos

653
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,179
is that one

654
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,279
raise your hands if you're yes there's

655
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,659
one this

656
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:49,679
is good I was thinking about these

657
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,880
questions like that No One's Gonna raise

658
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,279
their hands but hey good

659
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,460
so let's get into it

660
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,220
getting to know yourself this is going

661
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,559
to change over time

662
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,740
I mean really don't whenever you present

663
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,500
here is a static slide and this is the

664
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,880
answer to everything like really you're

665
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,980
going to change maybe tomorrow you might

666
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,679
see a presentation in the evening that's

667
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,000
going to change your life and be you

668
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,279
know I never knew I wanted to do fraud

669
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,059
investigations you may be who knows and

670
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,039
that's okay but really assessing

671
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,080
yourself regularly like this

672
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,600
um as I've done this it has helped me so

673
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,880
I hope it would do the same for you

674
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
um what do you like to do is important

675
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,299
and maybe more important than you let

676
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,580
yourself realize

677
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,960
um what are you good at

678
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,720
be honest you're good at something and

679
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,820
you have a unique contribution to add

680
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,559
even if you've got you're a team of 15

681
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,700
analysts or incident responders or

682
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,000
whatever you're on you are unique and

683
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,740
have something to add and especially as

684
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,500
you bring in additional experience

685
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,640
um you're going to look at something

686
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,679
slightly different and that is value

687
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,299
added

688
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:04,380
I like this too this is actually

689
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,659
really hard to think through but where

690
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,039
do you see yourself in the next five

691
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,320
years and in long term 15 years where do

692
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,840
you want to retire role wise that

693
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,779
question has been on my mind and it's

694
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,179
helped guide my decisions so when once

695
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,559
you and once you have that stuff think

696
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,179
about your hobbies

697
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,000
and do interesting hobbies and think

698
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,799
about how they're analogous to security

699
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,879
it's valuable

700
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,679
so just start working you know there

701
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,720
honestly you're going to be faking it at

702
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,340
some point now whatever role you're in

703
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,340
especially as you progress with more

704
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,260
responsibility or you become more senior

705
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,520
even if

706
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
even if you're never a people manager

707
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,520
because it's not what you want to do

708
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,679
technical

709
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,179
experts

710
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,400
always too there can be something new

711
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,260
that you need to learn about

712
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,960
new systems installed the world changes

713
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,600
you know maybe your organization moves

714
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,059
from AWS to gcp I mean there's going to

715
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,980
be some learning there

716
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,559
um whatever it is start and be

717
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,120
interested and open to learning new

718
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,760
things I love picking these projects

719
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,640
like random projects at home I really

720
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,880
try to have a healthy balance of what

721
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,380
I'm doing for work and what I'm doing

722
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,539
that's fun and I've tried to find and

723
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,220
work is fun I'm in security let's be

724
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,559
honest but it's really too if I just do

725
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,299
one thing all the time I worry I'll get

726
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,760
stale so sometimes

727
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,799
digging in and getting started doesn't

728
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,840
mean just more security you might find

729
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,059
something else I found metal working is

730
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,919
something I really love and so I've been

731
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,600
smelting aluminum cans and that's way

732
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,080
more work than it's worth but it's fun

733
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,059
uh and I found analogies there for my

734
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,260
life that have helped me and hopefully

735
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,240
made me a more interesting kind of

736
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,020
well-rounded person

737
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,059
I want to get into a little bit of

738
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,880
reporting on successes and a frame look

739
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,799
framework who am I this isn't a

740
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,360
framework it's like four it's like one

741
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
bullet on a slide but honestly this

742
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,620
having a little word has made this

743
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,539
interesting enough for me to do it every

744
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,440
year so I know Finnish as a language and

745
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,080
that language is really interesting and

746
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,500
I have a personal joke to myself so

747
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,740
mocha means mistake in Helsinki slang so

748
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,539
I thought to myself this is funny it's

749
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,580
also an acronym memorandum of key

750
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,520
accomplishments and it's just look it's

751
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
not a mistake so it's kind of a really

752
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
stupid inside joke to myself that I

753
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,340
shouldn't have shared but that's why it

754
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,260
says mocha up there and it's just I

755
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,200
every year I look through what I've done

756
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,779
I write down a couple of notes this

757
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,080
cannot be a giant dictionary or you will

758
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,320
never do it again just be simple but as

759
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,539
you've okay you found out something you

760
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,700
like you're now getting started in an

761
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,080
area that you're interested in and maybe

762
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,880
you want to expand

763
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,580
your security expertise maybe you want a

764
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,799
title change you have some goal

765
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,020
you're doing work that you can now how

766
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,299
does this relate to that goal write down

767
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,659
the success hand this to your

768
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,000
upline at the end of whenever you're

769
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,559
doing your performance review like

770
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,700
seriously

771
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,860
I think this has nothing to do whatever

772
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,720
your system is that they do that with

773
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,220
usually if you can attach something

774
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,840
that's what I do it's like they're

775
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,340
talking about all these goals this

776
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,020
doesn't even have this is my personal

777
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,080
key accomplishments that I then attach

778
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,279
and

779
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,840
um

780
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,820
I've really just augment whatever the

781
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,679
company wants me to do

782
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,960
with this so

783
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,940
I think this one's key though because if

784
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,039
you don't do that it gets harder to ask

785
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,200
for growth because that I think is

786
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,779
extremely important I know that it's

787
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,380
some may feel extremely nervous about

788
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,179
asking for some kind of promotion or for

789
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,980
a change you might feel like it makes

790
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,760
you sound needy or like they're gonna

791
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,260
not want to give you any assignments

792
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,299
because you just are asking for

793
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,620
something every time they ask you to do

794
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,740
something those last steps help growth

795
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,679
conversations be so much easier it

796
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,260
enables you to to prove okay

797
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,880
not only

798
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
was I interested and self-motivated I

799
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,799
got to work and I still got all the

800
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,620
stuff done I needed to before by the way

801
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,299
I recorded my successes and the way it

802
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,480
helped now I've done this research there

803
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,820
are these other positions that maybe

804
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,320
they have

805
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,659
uh maybe I like to look at LinkedIn job

806
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,059
roles just to get a feel for what

807
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,159
I don't know what am I doing now I don't

808
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,419
even know what to call myself sometimes

809
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,520
will anyone understand what an

810
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,799
information security officer is if I

811
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,840
just say that word or do I need to

812
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,700
use it different is it an architect you

813
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,799
know how much overlap is there what do I

814
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,500
want to be and I take those job roles

815
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,039
and I start dreaming up my

816
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,580
dream title or my dream salary or

817
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,440
whatever it is

818
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,840
and it's just if you a lot of times I

819
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,600
think we want to start here because

820
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,940
this is the best part when you see

821
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,580
growth it feels really good but if you

822
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,500
start here you just don't have the whole

823
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,539
package I think to really

824
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,880
um get what you're looking for

825
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,520
so those first few really set you up for

826
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,760
winning

827
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,480
um and I

828
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
honestly

829
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,380
new titles can be a promotion in

830
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,340
themselves if this ever fails for you

831
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,500
I think that having at least the

832
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,580
structure

833
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,220
will let you know well is it time to

834
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,500
look for another another company maybe

835
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,000
they'll have more growth opportunities

836
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,100
and it'll help you feel more confident

837
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,899
when you think to do things like that

838
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,480
and you don't just jump ship into like

839
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,039
out of the frying pan into the fire type

840
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,980
situation it'll help you be prepared so

841
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,440
I those are my main points again in

842
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,880
summary

843
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,340
know yourself because you're the driver

844
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,720
here

845
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
getting to work

846
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,740
um recording and Reporting on your

847
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,760
successes

848
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,100
and then asking for growth don't just do

849
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,200
all that awesome stuff and then not ask

850
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
for more because you uh you deserve it

851
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,720
and that is it and I get now the

852
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,200
pleasure to turn you over to Sherry

853
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,880
[Applause]

854
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,860
all right well thank you for bearing

855
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,799
with us this far and and I'll give you

856
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,380
some hope right I have a hacking demo

857
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,899
near the end of this so hold on you're

858
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,200
gonna make it it will get fun

859
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
um but uh awesome advice and it's a

860
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,460
pleasure to present with both of these

861
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,840
people

862
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,120
um I definitely suffer from imposter

863
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,159
syndrome that's something that I've

864
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,279
always struggled with and the way that I

865
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,799
combat against that is I surround myself

866
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,380
with brilliant people like I mean

867
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,480
all of you right I surround myself with

868
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,220
people I can learn from and who can

869
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,740
support me and that's why I constantly

870
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,260
drag Dennis with me to presentations

871
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,480
because I don't know why I get called on

872
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,240
things like this too but it's great to

873
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,460
have support and friends that you can

874
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,159
call on so if ever you're doubting in

875
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,719
yourself and you're wondering you know

876
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,780
are my ideas okay you know can I make it

877
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,980
in this

878
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,560
um you know can I get up and present can

879
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,080
I progress in a field like this you know

880
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,480
look to the people around you look to a

881
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,980
support group there's so many different

882
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,859
communities in cyber security especially

883
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,560
here in Utah right we have 801 Labs

884
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,119
that's a great group of people to

885
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,820
connect with Utah Saint you know who

886
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,580
puts together Saint Khan infragard I'm

887
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,440
in the presidency of infraguard it's a

888
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,980
FBI organization it's Community Based we

889
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,020
work with a lot of organizations and

890
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,099
we're constantly trying to help

891
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,980
companies be more secure you can join

892
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,159
infraguard women in cyber security

893
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,899
um you know we're for everybody so look

894
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,300
at different organizations that you have

895
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,619
here

896
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,420
um to to be a support group because it

897
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,740
makes a big difference because it's

898
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,619
scary to do things like this right but

899
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,300
it makes it a lot easier when you have

900
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,580
support and people around you

901
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,740
so you know join women in cyber security

902
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,900
because we'll be your support I love

903
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,060
helping people and lift them up and so

904
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,700
you know and many many people do in this

905
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,099
field so look to others to help

906
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,859
strengthen you now

907
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,040
um I'm Sherry Kelly currently I'm the

908
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,839
director of security operations and

909
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,359
Engineering for 3m's healthcare business

910
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,220
group

911
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,960
and I look at the things that I've

912
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,300
accomplished and I'm in shock by that

913
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,119
and and I think if I can do this if you

914
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,740
take nothing out of this presentation

915
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,780
just know that you know if I can do

916
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,520
these things you can accomplish great

917
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
things you can accomplish amazing things

918
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,020
in your life because there's no way I

919
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,119
would have pictured myself as a young

920
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,400
girl just messing around on the computer

921
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,579
doing anything like this I was the Cisco

922
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,400
for Swire Coca-Cola it's one of the the

923
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,380
bottlers for Coca-Cola

924
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,540
which was a great position to have but

925
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,579
quite honestly I love engineering I love

926
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,760
security operations uh so when uh this

927
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,980
is so at 3M when they reached out and

928
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,300
asked if I'd be interested in

929
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,619
interviewing for that it was just like

930
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,480
oh that's a dream I don't have to deal

931
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,940
with a lot of the political side and I

932
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,920
can just deal with engineering and the

933
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,140
technical pieces that I love and do that

934
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,900
all day long I mean it's it's fabulous I

935
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,240
have an amazing team that that I work

936
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,579
with too so it's a great place to be but

937
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,380
I mean just about everything in cyber

938
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,180
security quite honestly there's a lot of

939
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,619
different things you can do and it's

940
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,020
amazing but

941
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,320
anyway so you know once again if I can

942
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,760
do this that I was recently asked to be

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,740
a tech advisor for a congressional

944
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,800
subcommittee like what me

945
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,720
um I'm still like picturing myself as a

946
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,599
teenager you know hacking things right

947
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,760
um and and Congress is asking me to be a

948
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,859
tech advisor for a subcommittee you know

949
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,079
that's that's awesome and I'm glad that

950
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,180
they're reaching out to people like like

951
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,359
us right that that uh that just like to

952
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,619
hack stuff

953
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,300
um and to give them advice that's that's

954
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,280
an awesome thing so believe in yourself

955
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
right fight against those feelings that

956
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,480
you might have like imposter syndrome

957
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,160
you know tell yourself over and over

958
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,660
again that you really can't accomplish

959
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,820
things because you can and one day it's

960
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,140
going to just surprise you it probably

961
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,720
surprises you right now

962
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,240
all right so I wanted to talk a little

963
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,640
bit more about getting past the way that

964
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,619
we normally do things you know getting

965
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,839
past that that comfort zone of just

966
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,920
because we've always done it this way

967
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,300
we're going to keep doing it this way

968
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,280
right I think all of us probably

969
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,320
logically look at that and think that's

970
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
probably not a good idea right Grace

971
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,680
Hopper

972
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,740
so she created Cobalt programming which

973
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,339
is just awesome she's an amazing woman

974
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,079
and one of the things that she would say

975
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,119
is that you know the most damaging

976
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,040
phrase in the language is it's always

977
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,560
been done that way you know whenever I

978
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,180
hear that in an architecture meeting

979
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,619
that oh well we just have always done it

980
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,020
this way I'm like oh you know cringe you

981
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,640
know no let's not do things because

982
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,079
we've always done it that way right

983
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,660
let's try getting past that that mold

984
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,460
let's get rid of a box right like there

985
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,020
doesn't need to be a way that we do

986
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,060
things let's break out of those molds

987
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,440
and start thinking of different ways

988
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,720
that we can protect our environments

989
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,339
right different ways we can do just

990
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,560
about anything in life quite honestly

991
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,320
and you need that way of thinking

992
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,900
um in fact back so when I started in

993
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,300
technology I mean so my I pictured

994
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,599
myself truly as like a 1950s TV show

995
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,640
when I was a little girl like I would

996
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,339
imagine life as an adult in black and

997
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,079
white like that's how I pictured myself

998
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,660
you know I was gonna be June Cleaver I

999
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,040
was gonna go out on my run in the

1000
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,680
morning come home and like make a

1001
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,359
gourmet breakfast for my little family

1002
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,400
as I send them off to work in school and

1003
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,500
then spend all day cleaning and you know

1004
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,480
and have a pie coming out of the oven as

1005
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,160
soon as they came home like that to me

1006
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,020
that still sounds like heaven like that

1007
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,720
would be great but life isn't a straight

1008
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,579
line right you might think that life is

1009
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,619
going to be one way but it's not a

1010
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,540
straight line right it goes all over the

1011
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,460
place and you never know really where

1012
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,720
you're going to end up

1013
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,880
when I was a young girl um you know I'd

1014
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,520
watch my boy and my brothers uh play

1015
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,680
video games and I thought that's cool

1016
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,000
you know I'd play with them but I just

1017
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,500
really wanted to know how to make that

1018
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,599
like that was intriguing to me so I

1019
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,920
started playing around and this was back

1020
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,680
with DOs right and I found Q basic and

1021
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,119
that was just like gold to me I'm like

1022
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,980
what is this I can create my own thing

1023
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,480
like what are these if statements like

1024
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
how does this work and so I would just

1025
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,900
develop programs and I'd have my nieces

1026
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,700
come over and I'd make video games for

1027
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,339
them and I thought that was just awesome

1028
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,720
you know my parents

1029
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,180
um they had a small company and because

1030
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,280
I loved math and I was good on the

1031
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,320
computer they asked me to do their all

1032
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
their billing and their payroll and

1033
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
stuff and I was like 12. you know and

1034
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,720
I'm doing that I even did their taxes at

1035
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,880
one point right and I'm a kid so all I

1036
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,040
want to do is play with my friends

1037
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,900
um and so I started figuring out how to

1038
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,500
make scripts and I found that you know

1039
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,640
autoexec.bat right remember that back in

1040
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,760
the Dos days so I found how I could have

1041
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,099
you set up scripts based off of batch

1042
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,660
files and then connect it to macro

1043
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,180
Frozen word perfect so all my parents

1044
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,460
had to do was turn on the computer and

1045
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,260
follow along right and I would just like

1046
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,000
welcome them to the day you know would

1047
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,980
you like to do billing today Mom you

1048
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,260
know how can I help you and they just

1049
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,180
follow along and that was

1050
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,680
that was like one of my ways into

1051
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,060
computers and here I am like the whole

1052
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,380
time I'm like yeah I'm not going to do

1053
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,420
anything with this knowledge whatever

1054
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,920
but

1055
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,680
um but anyway and so like I you know I

1056
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,180
kept doing this in high school I took

1057
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,800
programming classes and networking

1058
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,900
classes at a tech center because I

1059
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,520
didn't offer it at our high school and

1060
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,900
anyway I won't tell you about the

1061
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,920
trouble I got into oddly enough later on

1062
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,420
when I was running a tech support

1063
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,980
department they had me come back as an

1064
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,040
alumni which was kind of funny to me

1065
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,700
um

1066
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,680
anyway their Network wasn't the most

1067
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,339
secure we'll just leave it there but

1068
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,920
um so then as I like I was 18 and I

1069
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,720
still didn't believe in myself right and

1070
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,400
I applied for a customer service job

1071
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,140
because I figured I'm like oh yeah I'll

1072
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,460
just do this that'll be fun I didn't

1073
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,920
even I didn't even take my Acts because

1074
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,480
I didn't think I was gonna go to college

1075
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
you know no one in my family went to

1076
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,540
college like I don't need to do that

1077
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,700
right I'm like 1950s you know June

1078
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,140
Cleaver

1079
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,640
um and so I applied for a customer

1080
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
service job just you know why not and

1081
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,320
and they looked at my background and saw

1082
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,700
that I had taken these programming

1083
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,380
classes networking classes and they're

1084
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,540
like why don't we have you come and be a

1085
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,520
tech computer technician for us I

1086
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,140
thought all right why not okay I'll try

1087
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,720
that and then there was a supervisor

1088
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
position that opened up and I you know I

1089
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,020
was always told that hey you should

1090
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,880
apply for things just you know just

1091
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,740
assert yourself try for things you never

1092
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,839
know so I applied I assumed of course

1093
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,700
they're not going to give it to me you

1094
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,140
know but surprisingly enough you know

1095
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,760
Scott schmuel he was the director at the

1096
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,920
time still a mentor of mine you know he

1097
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,599
believed in me when I didn't believe in

1098
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,119
myself and he saw in me the ability to

1099
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,880
motivate others and so he hired me as

1100
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,859
the supervisor I then became the manager

1101
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:59,099
at 19. I was managing 19 computer

1102
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,680
technicians right and most of them were

1103
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,619
men much older than me and

1104
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,480
it was shocking it was like management

1105
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,720
by fire right how do I do this

1106
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,700
um but you know

1107
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,740
and I guess you can tell right you know

1108
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,060
I still struggle like believe in

1109
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,339
yourself believe in yourself but what I

1110
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,579
found is that I loved my team like I had

1111
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,160
an amazing team but we were missing

1112
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,500
things like customer service skills you

1113
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,300
know there was there's only a few guys

1114
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,320
that were really good at customer

1115
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,579
service the rest of them just love

1116
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,020
technology and really couldn't stand

1117
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,079
people so I had to go out and convince

1118
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,260
our HR to find people looking for temp

1119
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,599
jobs you know so once I got into that

1120
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,099
position I started finding like well how

1121
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,619
can I expand my team so we can be more

1122
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,720
diverse so we can you know have other

1123
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,880
skills within our group and I told them

1124
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,619
to go find people applying for customer

1125
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,960
service jobs right I'm like I can teach

1126
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,000
someone technology you know that's easy

1127
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,099
like you know I can I can teach people

1128
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,079
that but I can't teach to someone to be

1129
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,359
nice to people that's a lot harder so I

1130
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,099
found these amazing women these single

1131
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,359
moms

1132
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,640
um you know one one you know for the

1133
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,660
Latina

1134
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,920
um you know just women from different

1135
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,720
backgrounds and diversities and

1136
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,400
struggles in their lives and when they

1137
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,780
came in interviewed with me they thought

1138
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,119
like there's no way I can do this and I

1139
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,740
asked him like you know are you

1140
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,839
motivated do you want to learn well yeah

1141
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:20,760
I'd like to learn I'm like okay I'm like

1142
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,920
I will teach you technology I'm like I

1143
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,140
need the skills that you can offer my

1144
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,240
team I need to have customer service I

1145
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,579
need people skills within my group and

1146
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,260
they're amazing girls on my team and

1147
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,940
they did an incredible job and they

1148
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,579
learned technology pretty quickly right

1149
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,560
I mean we you know this is stuff that we

1150
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,780
can teach people so don't be afraid to

1151
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,940
think outside the box right and there's

1152
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,579
there's benefits in diverse thinking

1153
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,200
right we I think we've probably oh

1154
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,640
there's only 10 minutes left oh man I'm

1155
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,540
gonna have to speed along all right

1156
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,640
we'll just get past stuff all right so

1157
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,900
we've probably already seen this before

1158
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,819
Grandma used to cut the ends off the

1159
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,160
roast so everyone else did you know

1160
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,720
that's that's not the way we need to do

1161
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,099
things

1162
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,440
um Civil War right could you imagine if

1163
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,540
war was still done the same way you know

1164
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,099
we don't need to do things the same way

1165
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,020
that we've always done it

1166
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,520
um and then in technology when we think

1167
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,680
about all of the different attacks

1168
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,640
happening we have so many

1169
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,079
vulnerabilities that are hitting against

1170
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,420
us all the time

1171
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,579
um you can't just have the I.T person

1172
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,800
right the traditional I.T guy that does

1173
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,540
the network that does security that does

1174
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,859
it all right you can't do that anymore

1175
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,500
there's just too much hitting us right

1176
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,359
there's vulnerabilities in each one of

1177
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,060
our environments uh in fact

1178
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,359
over the last year there was 28 000

1179
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,660
vulnerabilities in 2021. and this year

1180
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,160
we're probably going to see more than

1181
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,500
that there's almost 300 vulnerabilities

1182
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,380
found in systems every single day and a

1183
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,579
lot of these vulnerabilities in fact

1184
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,740
I'll show you this demo

1185
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,200
um a lot of these vulnerabilities allow

1186
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
you to get past the perimeter and get

1187
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,640
right into a server so we need to have

1188
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,500
different ways of thinking we can't do

1189
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,440
things the same way we always have

1190
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,220
um

1191
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,740
so this is an example this is a past

1192
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,319
organization I won't name any names but

1193
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,660
this I thought was kind of a cool

1194
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,480
exercise in how diverse ways of thinking

1195
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,220
is very valuable within your security

1196
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,920
team so we started getting hit by a lot

1197
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,240
of attacks and we weren't sure what was

1198
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,280
going on but one thing we noticed is

1199
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,980
that there was a common

1200
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,079
um kind of a common variable that was

1201
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,180
continually used and when I looked at it

1202
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,520
I just assumed it was just a random you

1203
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,740
know a group of characters you know you

1204
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,060
look at the content string and that's

1205
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,980
very random so I didn't think there was

1206
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,420
anything really to that variable I just

1207
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,560
thought maybe they just put that in

1208
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,260
there but a member of my team who is

1209
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,359
from an Asian country

1210
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,520
he has a lot of family in Vietnam and

1211
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,500
friends and he said he's like Sherry do

1212
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,000
you know on is like the most common

1213
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,760
Vietnamese name I'm like oh and then

1214
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,380
apparently it also means elder brother

1215
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,660
and it could also be me I so someone

1216
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,520
could be referring to themselves and so

1217
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,780
then I started looking at it from a

1218
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,859
different angle because I'm like oh I

1219
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,540
guess that's true and then NT can be an

1220
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,900
abbreviation for a very common last name

1221
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,099
and so we started looking at it a little

1222
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,720
bit from a different lens and lo and

1223
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,180
behold I started finding a lot of IP

1224
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,579
addresses from Vietnam and then we

1225
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,140
started connecting some of those IP

1226
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,119
addresses they weren't like obviously

1227
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,520
known as being malicious for this group

1228
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,440
but we were able to tie all of them back

1229
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,480
to a beetle it's called the beetle group

1230
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,880
it's an organized crime group out of

1231
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,280
Vietnam and if I didn't have a member of

1232
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,680
my team with a diverse background I

1233
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,000
wouldn't have been able to make those

1234
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,160
connections but because we found that we

1235
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,780
were able to track down all the activity

1236
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,700
that was happening find out that they

1237
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,500
were trying to take advantage of a zero

1238
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,480
day that was going on and block it

1239
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,980
before anything happened in our

1240
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,680
environment so there's great benefit and

1241
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,359
diverse ways of thinking like your

1242
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,400
background whether it's Arabic you know

1243
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,440
fraud investigation whatever it is

1244
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,359
there's value in that we need that in

1245
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,220
cyber security

1246
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,839
you know cyber security doesn't look

1247
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,940
like just one thing right fraud

1248
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,859
investigation is a very important one

1249
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,720
data science data analytics project

1250
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,300
management my team knows that the person

1251
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,859
who probably works the hardest on our

1252
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:04,740
entire team is our project manager he's

1253
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,020
absolutely amazing right you need lots

1254
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,819
of different skill sets in order for

1255
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,280
your team to thrive and be successful

1256
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,319
all right so let's just get to the demo

1257
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,060
because that's the cool stuff

1258
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,099
um so I wanted to show

1259
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,579
a demo of how you can do vulnerabilities

1260
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:22,260
and this one's for spring for Shell if

1261
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,880
you've heard of that one

1262
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,960
um so spring for Shell is a

1263
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,460
vulnerability that came out in March of

1264
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,920
this year and you have to have a certain

1265
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,380
environment so you have to have a

1266
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,760
certain version of java a certain

1267
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,339
version of spring framework and you have

1268
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,359
to be

1269
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,180
push play on that

1270
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,640
um you have to have it running out of

1271
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,180
container a tomcat container so this is

1272
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,800
recorded because I did this for a

1273
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,780
Homeland Security presentation and they

1274
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,640
made me record it so that way they can

1275
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,440
inspect everything to make sure it was

1276
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,079
okay for me to present but this is live

1277
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,180
like I really did all of this here I'll

1278
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,920
stop right there okay so this is a

1279
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,839
program I create I just you know Java I

1280
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,220
put it in a container it's running off

1281
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,040
of the Tomcat server it's obviously very

1282
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,319
vulnerable the spring for Shell so what

1283
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:08,640
I'm doing right now is I've just

1284
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,819
downloaded an exploit that's

1285
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,160
oh it's not showing oh shoot

1286
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,759
yeah you guys are

1287
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,380
lucky like even though

1288
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,819
you know this was running off of my

1289
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:28,140
machine because obviously I'm just doing

1290
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,480
this as a test environment

1291
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,359
um so this is the Java application

1292
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,800
see is it actually working okay I think

1293
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,720
it's working now all right so here's the

1294
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,180
exploit here so I just downloaded this I

1295
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,700
just tweaked it just a little bit for um

1296
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,339
demonstration purposes but now I'm just

1297
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,500
going to run that against the website

1298
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,000
that I created

1299
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,339
kind of simple right and here we go

1300
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,460
let's see if we can pause

1301
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,819
this if I can find how to get there

1302
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,560
that's it

1303
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,800
we'll go faster but so here I just run

1304
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,619
the exploit against this and you can see

1305
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,200
that it it now has captured shell on the

1306
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,119
back end server so it was able to

1307
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,760
exploit a vulnerability inside the

1308
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,880
spring the spring framework

1309
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,480
interconnected with all those other

1310
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,540
pieces and now I'm able to connect right

1311
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,839
into the server so we'll play again

1312
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,760
okay so I'm just going to take it says

1313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,619
shell can be located at right that's

1314
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,000
like my local machine because that's

1315
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,099
where I'm running it from okay so now

1316
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,900
I'm on the server this is me on the

1317
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,880
server I'm going to just type in a Linux

1318
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,680
command because it's a Linux server so

1319
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,560
I'm typing in who am I I'm root and root

1320
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,180
gives you system access I have access to

1321
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,800
anything I want pretty much on this

1322
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,599
server now I'm just going to take a look

1323
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,880
at what's on here I just typed list this

1324
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,319
is showing me the files it's really

1325
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,640
basic because I just threw this together

1326
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,240
but I'm going to take a look at this

1327
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,099
palm.xml and see what's in there so I

1328
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,119
can see there's a little more

1329
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,420
information

1330
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,680
uh not there we go I can see there's a

1331
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,940
little more information about the system

1332
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,280
so I could learn some stuff but okay

1333
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,839
that's fun but let's see what else we

1334
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,599
can do here so now we're going to take a

1335
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,700
look at if we can find maybe users

1336
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,040
who've signed in on the server

1337
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,520
so I put in ETC password sometimes you

1338
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,380
can get the password in here but usually

1339
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,119
it's just the usernames

1340
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,800
so you can see this was Homeland

1341
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,240
Security that I created this for right

1342
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,460
so Dirty Harry made a lot of sense in

1343
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,680
that context so the user who signed in

1344
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,119
was Dirty Harry

1345
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,060
all right so now I got the username but

1346
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,859
maybe let's just see if there's a

1347
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:34,380
password copy in the shadow file so I'm

1348
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,420
going to the shadow file now on Linux

1349
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,060
and lo and behold there's the password

1350
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,119
it's encrypted but there's the password

1351
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,640
and so I'm going to copy that

1352
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,040
and I intentionally made the encryption

1353
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,480
pretty simple just so I could

1354
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,220
demonstrate like all the way to the

1355
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,300
finish line

1356
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,640
so I'm going to copy that and paste it

1357
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,619
in here this is a little decryption tool

1358
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,319
that I have to break that down so any

1359
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,000
guesses I want Dirty Harry's password

1360
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,599
could be

1361
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,460
make my day maybe what other whatever

1362
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,800
things do you think Dirty Harry says

1363
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,160
yeah do I feel lucky punk well do you

1364
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,040
right um so I mean you see how simple

1365
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,780
that was I mean how long did that take

1366
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,579
right like you could count that down how

1367
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,859
fast that was that I found a system that

1368
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,839
was vulnerable for spring for Shell I

1369
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,000
ran the exploit against it

1370
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,579
um I was able to get onto the server

1371
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,800
grab what I wanted and what you would

1372
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,660
see on the back end logs here would be

1373
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,300
somebody just running Etc password Etc

1374
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,880
Shadow right hopefully that generates

1375
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,640
some alerts but it may also look like an

1376
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,319
admin on the system because they were

1377
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,000
signed in as root so it's really scary

1378
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,240
so there's a lot of vulnerabilities out

1379
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,920
there

1380
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,900
that that should worry us right that

1381
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,000
keep I I know our team up at night and

1382
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,800
you can't count on luck and we can't do

1383
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,720
things the same way we've done it all

1384
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,119
over and over again right we have to

1385
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,280
have all of us we need people with

1386
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,839
different backgrounds we need people

1387
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:02,579
with different ways of thinking to come

1388
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,579
together in order to combat against this

1389
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,500
one layer of protection isn't enough we

1390
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,180
need lots of different ways of thinking

1391
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,780
and we need a team of people to help us

1392
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,540
to combat against this all right so

1393
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,859
thank you

1394
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,720
um do we have time for a question answer

1395
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,780
okay cool uh so we're gonna just open it

1396
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,200
up now if you guys have any questions

1397
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,680
um I don't know if they set up a mic

1398
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,119
maybe not

1399
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,859
just this one

1400
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:33,420
yeah if you want you could just come up

1401
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,339
here or just yell loud and we could

1402
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:39,799
repeat it that might be easier so yeah

1403
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,440
oh hello sir

1404
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,839
yeah that's a great question so the

1405
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,059
question is are there any tools or

1406
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,099
tactics to get to know yourself better

1407
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,920
the fast answer is do a lot

1408
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,000
so

1409
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,440
I

1410
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,180
have had an opportunity to get involved

1411
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,339
with some youth groups for example we

1412
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,740
build things I've got some friends that

1413
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,780
have other things they think is fun

1414
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,700
outside of Technology they're in very

1415
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,440
kinetic space and I love when technology

1416
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,599
hits the physical world so I've Loved

1417
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,700
learning from them and then I try to do

1418
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,800
my own spin on it and then I learn oh I

1419
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,240
actually don't like that or I like that

1420
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,240
this much but no further

1421
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,619
and I volunteer for a lot of stuff at

1422
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,960
work and like Sherry says Dennis you

1423
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,819
want to do this presentation yeah I'll

1424
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,140
do that and then I find out I actually

1425
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,359
kind of like presenting so there's a

1426
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,279
short answer just start diving in

1427
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,720
all right any other questions and it

1428
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,520
might be hard to see so wave your hand

1429
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,420
if you have any questions

1430
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:29,280
it's a good question so I try and

1431
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,680
um we do it collaboratively with my team

1432
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,079
so we'll create a OneNote and team as

1433
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,720
teams is as easy as that for me

1434
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,000
personally

1435
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,680
I tend to dabble in kind of visual

1436
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,140
graphic type stuff so I'll create a cute

1437
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,240
little at the risk of sounding super

1438
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,240
girly I create a cute little just um

1439
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,180
spreadsheet that's makes me want to go

1440
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,460
to it so I don't and I leave it open and

1441
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,700
I just jot things down successes

1442
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,380
challenges and then with the challenges

1443
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,359
create a roadmap on how to address those

1444
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:02,839
challenges

1445
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,400
okay

1446
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,359
anything else

1447
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,980
that's awesome so he was asking what

1448
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,540
advice could we give to young girls

1449
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,640
today who are interested in technology

1450
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,200
you know first of all I mean it's

1451
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,599
amazing place for women to be you know

1452
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
the first um the word computers right

1453
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,059
that comes from women who were computers

1454
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:47,040
they were they would compute for NASA

1455
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,140
they would put together algorithms to

1456
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,880
help NASA and that's where that term

1457
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,220
actually comes from so the history of

1458
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,640
computers is actually women and so let

1459
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,020
your daughters know that yeah women

1460
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,059
deserve need to be in this space this is

1461
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,740
our history it's in our blood it's a

1462
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,079
part of who we are right we we belong

1463
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,220
here

1464
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,319
um and uh and and yeah there's going to

1465
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:09,180
be times where maybe they're the only

1466
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,059
girl in their department or in that room

1467
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,220
but there's lots of guys that are going

1468
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,240
to be surrounding them that are going to

1469
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,339
be supporting them and helpful you know
