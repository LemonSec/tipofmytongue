1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,100
good afternoon everyone thank you for

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,780
joining our talk my name is Bobby

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,299
Preston I'm with WMC Global this is our

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,580
first time at St con we flew in from

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,860
Washington DC a couple days ago I'm here

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,380
with my colleague Ben so first I

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,460
just want to again thank you and the

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
volunteers at St Khan for having us uh

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,119
this this conference came highly

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,859
regarded and we were told to come out

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,060
here and we can see why from the

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,160
community aspect uh why this conference

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,619
is considered to be so special so uh

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,300
thank you for making us newbies feel

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,199
welcome

16
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,099
um with that I'm going to hand over to

17
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,420
Ben give you the sense of where we come

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
from and then we'll dive into some of

19
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,700
the content

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,520
and so WSC Global is a threat

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
intelligence company that is uh we're

22
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,219
mobile first but not mobile only we

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,379
specialize in fishing

24
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,079
um fishing kits complements compromise

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
credential recovery

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,399
um and threat actor attribution and I

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,539
just got to tell you right now I hate

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,120
public speaking so please forgive me I'm

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,559
going to stumble but I'll get through

30
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,480
this

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,820
and I come with six years of background

32
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,800
work with anti-fishing Technologies it's

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
a problem that we're passionate about

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,339
solving and Ben was part of the original

35
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,380
team in the early 90s who helped develop

36
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,659
the interoperability of SMS so if you

37
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,460
think about the mid 90s Verizon context

38
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,619
Verizon

39
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,420
attached at T with the ability to open

40
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,280
up those channels Ben's team played a

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,900
role in that so we have a close

42
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,000
understanding of how these how this

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,220
network is connected uh in playing our

44
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,259
little part into the billion dollar

45
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,020
industry that SMS marketing or SMS plays

46
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,500
as a role that SMS plays today to really

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,020
just start with a fair warning we're

48
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,520
going to cover some fishing kits that

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,380
are impacting different brands and

50
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,180
certain brands are being blocked so

51
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,439
we're not trying to pick on anyone here

52
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,960
but this is where the data took us so

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
just wanted to say no hard feelings this

54
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
is uh just the right form to share you

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
know what we're looking at in the threat

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,000
actor source code and the fishing kits

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,360
so why SMS I think the threat actors

58
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,619
realize that they have an attentive

59
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,240
audience if you think about the open

60
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,420
rate with email compared to 98 it's

61
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,340
almost a guarantee that the SMS message

62
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,079
that the threat actor is delivering is

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,939
going to be open on top of that they

64
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,979
have the timeliness so over half the

65
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,318
text messages that are delivered are

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,940
read within one or five minutes I'm not

67
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,980
sure if we can all relate to that but

68
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,599
some people refuse to have a

69
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,520
notification go unanswered and so that

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,900
the threat actors realize that they have

71
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,280
an attentive audience that will be

72
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,739
timely in the action you know depending

73
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:23,879
on the call to action that they're

74
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,099
trying to get across now when we think

75
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,780
about how these messages reach our

76
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,860
handsets there's a few different

77
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,959
channels that that can be used whether

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,060
it's person to person or application of

79
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,440
person there are several different

80
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
channels that the threat actors can

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
leverage based on the type of message or

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,140
what the end goal is in the fishing

83
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,420
campaign itself so to start out I

84
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,800
mentioned peer person to person that's

85
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,480
what we're all familiar with texting

86
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,040
with our family friends and loved ones

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,900
but application to person has really

88
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
skyrocketed over the last decade if we

89
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,019
think about the engagement between

90
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,360
corporations and Enterprises with their

91
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,640
consumers be it your local pizza parlor

92
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
or Uber over we're all familiar with

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,660
those automated notifications and those

94
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,280
are delivered over application to person

95
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,379
channels there's two in particular the

96
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,940
10 digit long code is probably most

97
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,800
popular where these companies like

98
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,140
Google and twilio they have these large

99
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,459
amounts of numbers that you can purchase

100
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,140
and buy so you can engage with your

101
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,180
audience that also is something that the

102
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,860
threat actors take advantage of knowing

103
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,659
that they have an attentive audience and

104
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,400
they can send SMS messages through

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
trusted channels that allows those

106
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,200
messages to reach the handsets and then

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
the second application to person

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,099
technique is called short code so it

109
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,659
says four or five or six digit numbers

110
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,280
that you see from really large

111
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,319
corporations and short code is probably

112
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,180
the most they're probably the cleanest

113
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,220
Channel most secure way most secure it's

114
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,560
most highly regulated channel of what

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,819
we're looking at here for the different

116
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,920
delivery methods and so this is

117
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,200
regulated by a compliance program and

118
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,519
these codes you might have some

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,319
marketing teams that use these codes to

120
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,540
engage with their user base all those

121
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,580
some of their messages also come across

122
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,799
as fishy as security Personnel looking

123
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,720
at some of these messages and then

124
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,700
finally we have email at SMS and I know

125
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,200
Ben is passionate about this channel in

126
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,239
particular

127
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
email SMS the easiest way to describe

128
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,799
this is a dumpster fire there's zero

129
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,019
barrier to entry for somebody to send

130
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,840
email to SMS threat actors know this and

131
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
they leverage this so if you think about

132
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,858
this to send

133
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,320
a quarter million half a million

134
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,779
uh different types of text messages

135
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,120
through an emailed SMS Channel takes

136
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,220
about 30 seconds and if you're playing

137
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,620
whack-a-mole in this space it's already

138
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,259
on the handsets a couple other notes

139
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,759
about this so if we're talking about how

140
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,800
threat actors use these channels and the

141
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,419
P2P Channel you might have heard the

142
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,880
term sem boxing as you get a little box

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,740
you get a bunch of SIM cards you pump it

144
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,740
in there you attach it to a computer and

145
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,380
you blast out your spamming or fishing a

146
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,180
to P or 10 digit long code where you're

147
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,040
going through a c pass platform which

148
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,520
we'll talk about on the next slide

149
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,199
compromise API Keys

150
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,180
um if you're paying attention to the

151
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,340
news there was a big breach that

152
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,860
happened on the CPAs platform where a

153
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,979
lot of those API keys were exposed short

154
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,300
codes so short codes do get used in

155
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,020
phishing attacks or in spam attacks but

156
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,240
because it's so highly regulated we

157
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,620
don't see that happen usually when a

158
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,300
fishing campaign hits on a short code

159
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,240
it's all only live for a few minutes and

160
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
and then that short code either gets

161
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,039
shut down or that uh that attack gets

162
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,460
mitigated and then email SMS uh you you

163
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,800
know how to spoof an email if you know

164
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
how to send email through an open relay

165
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,580
I mean you can put put everything

166
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,160
together and this channel is just way

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
abused uh we we are actually working

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
with the federal government on how to

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,900
regulate this a little bit better to

170
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,520
protect people because it's just too

171
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,000
wide open

172
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,539
so you have those different channels

173
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,860
that you can use to deliver the method

174
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,419
but what is the mechanism that you use

175
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,000
to deliver this bam message CPAs is

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
probably the most popular so these are

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
legitimate services that can be used for

178
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
for various means mostly through account

179
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
takeover so as close as you know as we

180
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,960
try to be as best as we can about

181
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,180
protecting our credentials but if you

182
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,039
realize that your teams have access to a

183
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,080
CPAs platform with a certain volume of

184
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,400
messages that you can send on a monthly

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
basis it's worth double checking you

186
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
know which team is operating the CPAs

187
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,220
platform and double checking on those

188
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,259
credentials because these are trusted

189
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,000
pipes it allows those messages to reach

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
the handset so even you know if you

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
think about the different methods that

192
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,880
carriers use to try and stop these

193
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,860
messages from being delivered if you

194
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,840
have trusted pipes it again that just

195
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,039
increases the likelihood that the

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,639
campaign will get past the SMS firewall

197
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,919
the second and third so what we see with

198
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,660
open source software and tools built

199
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,400
into fishing kits in particular and

200
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,780
we'll show you some different examples

201
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,600
but marketing tools there's a wide range

202
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,280
of marketing tools that again legitimate

203
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
businesses that get used nefariously but

204
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,660
I will say there's a range between the

205
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,180
Shady online or e-marketing tools and

206
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,340
legitimate ones a good example of more

207
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,300
of a shady one is SMS bulk Dash sms.us

208
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,360
which is now hosted on dot Biz but they

209
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
know their audience where if you can

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
upload a message with numbers that

211
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
you've purchased legitimately this tool

212
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,220
will promise to deliver the method and

213
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
they use the marketing statistics to

214
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,940
back up the the almost guarantee of the

215
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,699
messages being being delivered hold on

216
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,900
the slide for just a second if you

217
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,699
notice on the slide up there you've got

218
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,759
nexmo twilio and text local so these are

219
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,460
these are legitimate companies that are

220
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,699
setting up infrastructure to allow

221
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,400
marketing firms to send out messages

222
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,580
that are not spam or not phishing and so

223
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,680
so we see these guys getting targeted

224
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,220
for API Keys the other thing that I'll

225
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,120
I'll note here is the CPAs platforms

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,099
they make their sdks for their tools

227
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,919
open source so when you know Bobby says

228
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,720
we see these embedded in the actual

229
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
fishing kits that's the SDK they'll take

230
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,060
that SDK put it in the fishing kit now

231
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,099
not only do they have a phishing website

232
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,719
but they have a means of delivery

233
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,539
in terms of emerging Trends it feels

234
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,099
like this is Shifting every six to 12

235
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,020
months so it was tough to only boil it

236
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,120
down to a few but if we think about the

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,380
conversations that we're having with

238
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,639
different teams whether it's Financial

239
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,860
Services or just a large Enterprise the

240
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,060
three that we see the most common

241
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,280
popping up the first one being smaller

242
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,080
campaigns I think we're used to seeing

243
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
more spray and pray campaigns in the in

244
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
terms of volume and number of messages

245
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,840
but there's also the number of unique

246
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,640
URLs that are built into these larger

247
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,039
campaigns over the last six to 12 months

248
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,599
we've just seen a longer tale of

249
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,458
businesses who haven't been impacted or

250
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,559
targeted or imitated through SMS before

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
which whether they're going after low

252
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
hanging fruit or they're just trying to

253
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,140
you know look at companies that maybe

254
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,880
aren't familiar with how to respond to

255
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,200
these campaigns or have a different set

256
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
of resources what we're seeing them is

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,220
just building these fishing kits you

258
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,320
know in you know first we'll talk about

259
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,459
some of the threat actors and how

260
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,200
prolific they are in terms of hundreds

261
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,580
of kits that these folks are building

262
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,519
over a yearly basis but smaller

263
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,019
campaigns the two examples that we have

264
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,720
being Microsoft and Uber small campaigns

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,220
is something that we continue to expect

266
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,500
to see so if you just take a look at

267
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,820
your peers and who else might be

268
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,920
affected through headlines or press

269
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,540
releases you don't have to say it's

270
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,100
going to happen to you but you know it

271
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,080
might come it wouldn't surprise us I

272
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,640
think we see them roaming around based

273
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
on how successful the you know these

274
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,500
campaigns are so just stay aware

275
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,360
smaller campaigns were started by threat

276
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
actors to avoid volumetrics and blocking

277
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,560
so you know these big spray and prey

278
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,640
campaigns where they would get you know

279
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,800
a hundred thousand numbers and they

280
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,019
would Snowshoe their way through the the

281
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,959
carrier platforms to try and be hidden

282
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,580
started getting picked up more and more

283
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,560
so what they found is that they lowered

284
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
the number of messages that they were

285
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,519
sending out in a phishing campaign they

286
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,120
wouldn't click the volumetrics uh

287
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,800
Rule and they were able to do this and

288
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,380
they were getting a little bit more

289
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,060
lucrative return on on what they're

290
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,580
doing two things to note here so in here

291
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,800
if you look at this this is a classic

292
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,420
call to action where you've got a URL

293
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,860
you're going to hear me talking about

294
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,320
kill chain one of the things that we try

295
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
and educate folks on it is the the kill

296
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
chain of of hitting a domain and

297
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,980
knocking that domain down that's just

298
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,260
one area on these two you'll see you've

299
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,060
got two pieces of kill chain here you've

300
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,100
got not only the URL or the domain

301
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,420
you've got the phone number that's

302
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
sending it there's two point places that

303
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,839
you can do a kill on this and if you

304
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,940
kill the number you're likely going to

305
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
kill more campaigns if you kill the

306
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,720
domain you've killed that one if you hit

307
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,459
that domain and take it down that domain

308
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,779
is already on handsets It's Already Done

309
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,760
its damage if you get that number you're

310
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
gonna if you take that number down that

311
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,620
number can now no longer send text

312
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,320
messages or that number gets blocked for

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,060
sending text messages and now the threat

314
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
actor has to think oh I've got to go get

315
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,060
another number so now you're causing

316
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,519
that threat after a little bit of pain

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,140
second emerging Trend we're seeing is

318
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,000
missing division where a text messages

319
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,560
will be delivered and there won't be a

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
URL in the text message it will ask the

321
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,279
user to call a certain number in

322
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,839
response to a certain fraudulent charge

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,519
so if you think about what the threat

324
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
actor can take away from a submission to

325
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,480
fishing because there's no URL to scan

326
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,300
the SMS firewall it's more likely that

327
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,519
the this SMS will get through those

328
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,220
existing controls but you also have an

329
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,140
ID number at the bottom so if someone

330
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,600
calls that number that the ID number at

331
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,980
the bottom of the text message can be

332
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,140
used as an identifier so they can manage

333
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,700
which campaign this alleged user is

334
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,440
calling from so in this example it's

335
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,540
Wells Fargo but we have another example

336
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,519
where that same phone number what was

337
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,380
imitating Bank of America

338
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,300
so in this situation what the threat

339
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,500
actor is doing is they're they're

340
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,540
sending this out and they're using one

341
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,399
phone number for the victim to call back

342
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,160
on if they they'll ask the victim um

343
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,440
what's your ID number if the victim says

344
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
well there was no ID number they know

345
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,980
they've got a Bank of America client

346
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,500
well my ID number is blah blah blah blah

347
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,180
they know that they've got a Wells Fargo

348
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,279
take note in that text message that

349
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,800
number up there that one four one zero

350
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,380
one zero zero zero two seven a lot of

351
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,459
folks will look at that and go that

352
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,800
looks kind of strange that's emailed SMS

353
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,540
that's the smsc that does the

354
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,820
translation from the email account to a

355
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,140
number so that it can pass through the

356
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,220
smsc to be delivered

357
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,899
and then the third emerging trend is CEO

358
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,820
impersonation so the text message that

359
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,860
we've received from our boss which is

360
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,779
really a scammer on the other end I

361
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,040
think some of the questions that we get

362
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,019
are how do they have access to my

363
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,420
employees phone numbers uh should I have

364
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,760
my employees save my CEO's email or

365
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,040
phone number in their phone books you

366
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,720
know it's gonna you might roll your eyes

367
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
on this but this one really goes back to

368
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
that user awareness see something say

369
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,420
something I think it's so easy to use

370
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,160
tools and marketing tools to identify

371
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,440
who's the newest hire at the company if

372
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,639
it's a smaller company what are the

373
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,019
likelihood what are the odds that the

374
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,000
CEO could reach out to this user so

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,100
whether your company is 50 people or 15

376
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,959
000 people I think if you can start to

377
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,279
understand who is receiving text

378
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,920
messages like this and start to track

379
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,940
those Trends you can have one

380
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,560
understanding of how often people

381
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
because are receiving these because I we

382
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,240
all are familiar with happy clickers but

383
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,560
maybe those happy clickers are more

384
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,660
likely to move go through this campaign

385
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,120
now then your team engages with these

386
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,339
yeah well the first thing I'll tell you

387
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,019
is how about educating your folks that

388
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,519
the CEO is never going to call a common

389
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,420
employee I mean come on my I wish my CEO

390
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,500
wouldn't talk to me but I report

391
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,959
directly to him so maybe I need to lower

392
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,220
myself here

393
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,019
um so yeah we we engage with these guys

394
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,420
so what this is is uh the threat actor

395
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,459
is looking for you to do him a favor

396
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,079
he'll ask you to go out and get Apple

397
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,600
gift cards or Google Play gift cards or

398
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,459
something like that scratch off the back

399
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm in with a client this client's doing

400
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,839
us a real solid so I want to give them

401
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,880
something or or it's this guy's birthday

402
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,740
I want to give him something you scratch

403
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,079
off the back they normally run they'll

404
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,820
tell you to get two gift cards for 500

405
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,320
each

406
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,060
um I would tell you the last one that

407
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,579
that I engage with personally

408
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,740
um you know the guy at the other end the

409
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,000
threat actor was saying just go ahead

410
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,860
and use your uh your corporate card on

411
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,540
this so he was he was real

412
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,079
oh the numbers are easy to get we'll

413
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,700
talk about that in a little bit but I

414
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,440
mean to get a number to send the text

415
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
message just look up text now

416
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
easy way to get uh of if you have an

417
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,579
email account you can send a text

418
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,800
message on a number

419
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,079
so yeah we'll talk about that there's a

420
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,000
million ways that numbers are plentiful

421
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,560
so we're going to take a text message

422
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,420
and go through a story so we're going to

423
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,820
link one text message the URL back to a

424
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,320
phishing kit and what we're going to try

425
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
to do is demonstrate the different

426
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,220
blocking mechanisms of Asian techniques

427
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,740
and show and start to paint a picture of

428
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,360
how prolific one actor is how many

429
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,220
campaigns is one kit responsible for

430
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,079
because we're all familiar with the URL

431
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,820
takedowns but I think we're reaching a

432
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,959
point where we can start to ask more

433
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,760
from our vendors Beyond how many URLs

434
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,440
did you take down you know which kit was

435
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,060
behind it can you tell me where the data

436
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,680
was being exfiltrated I mean the

437
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
information is available so what we'll

438
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,860
do is let's just start here and then

439
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,720
we'll guide us through it if you don't

440
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,579
know what a fishing kit is

441
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,740
um and you know I'll assume a bunch of

442
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,540
you do but just in case you don't

443
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,360
um it's when the the threat actor is

444
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,399
going to deploy a fishing site he

445
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,139
doesn't compromise a domain and then go

446
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,339
up there and code the phishing site

447
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,920
he'll code the fishing site offline and

448
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,720
then he'll zip that up into a zip file

449
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,820
and then he'll deploy that to a stolen

450
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,199
domain

451
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,660
um a free domain a compromised domain

452
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,360
then he unzips that now that campaign is

453
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,820
live all he needs to do is push traffic

454
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,000
through it in this case uh on on that

455
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,699
URL we were able to find this fishing

456
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,920
kit and so we're going to start taking a

457
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,660
look at this fishing kit again I want to

458
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,220
iterate you're going to see a lot of

459
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,899
company names in here we're not trying

460
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,519
to pick on anybody everybody's getting

461
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,040
hit this is where the data took us the

462
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,600
other thing to note is we're going to

463
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,519
put out a lot of information in the next

464
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,019
couple of minutes

465
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,320
um so you know bear with us and if you

466
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,240
want to talk afterwards we are really

467
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,980
passionate about this and we will talk

468
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,500
till midnight tonight about this but we

469
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,320
only have another 45 minutes clock is

470
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,420
ticking clock is ticking so this is what

471
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,120
a fishing kit looks like if you look on

472
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
the if you look here so here's the the

473
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,959
types of files that are inside this

474
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,720
fishing kit you got PHP files PNG files

475
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,800
JavaScript CSS text files jpegs all of

476
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,699
this

477
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,320
um

478
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,180
this gives us a view of what the

479
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,980
directory tree looks like if you were

480
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,079
actually sitting on the server so

481
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,699
interesting to note here we are not

482
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,380
sitting on the server this is actually

483
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,600
from the kit being pulled down a couple

484
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,880
of things to to take note of here the

485
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,899
first file we're going to look at is

486
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,699
this finish.php but keep in mind that l0

487
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,380
gz

488
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,480
um you can tell hackers love their their

489
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
lead speak

490
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,060
um

491
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,940
so here we go with the with the um with

492
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,160
this file so here the threat actor

493
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,680
crypto now we've been chasing crypto for

494
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,620
a while uh one quick note

495
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,839
there are two players in this there's

496
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,000
the kit developer and then there's the

497
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,760
kit operator they're not always the same

498
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,099
person sometimes they are the kit

499
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,319
developer will sometimes develop kits

500
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,380
and sell them to the kit operators we're

501
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,140
not sure about crypto uh I'm of the

502
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,819
opinion that crypto is both the

503
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,040
developer and the operator

504
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,419
um but we're going to check this notice

505
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,579
that he is a telegram guy

506
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,959
um you're going to see a lot of telegram

507
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,380
in here

508
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,640
now we're going to start breaking apart

509
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,559
what this Kit's doing so here is

510
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,660
everything that the kit is harvesting or

511
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,520
this fishing page is harvesting from the

512
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,220
victim so you've got username you've got

513
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,039
password you've got billing information

514
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,960
in the billing information take note of

515
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
mobile so they're asking for your mobile

516
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
number and they're asking for your

517
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
carrier pen we're going to talk about

518
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,380
that in just a second

519
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,000
you're grabbing credit card information

520
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,620
so now they got your credit card number

521
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,580
your your CVV expiration social security

522
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,539
number ATM pin beninfo

523
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,720
the second part here is email address to

524
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,660
password or email address and password

525
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,580
um so I want to I want you to think

526
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,020
about something if I've got your email

527
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,580
account and your password what

528
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,559
information can I deem from that I can

529
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,000
find out who else you're banking with

530
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
what streaming services you have who

531
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,440
you're doing business with who your

532
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,860
family is I've got all that information

533
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,280
now if I have that carrier or your phone

534
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,160
number and that carrier pen I can do a

535
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
some swap

536
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,100
so think about this I figure out all

537
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,500
your Banks now I'm going to go and I'm

538
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,760
going to drain all the money from the

539
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,340
banks but your bank's on 2fa I go into a

540
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,580
Sim swap I take your number over I hit

541
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,220
all of your your Banks I do withdrawals

542
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
I use your phone as two-factor

543
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,360
authentication once I'm done I throw all

544
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,460
that away and walk away we see in

545
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,080
Telegram

546
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,960
these credentials that go up for sale if

547
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,960
there is a phone number and a carrier

548
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,700
pen code that will go for about 700 to a

549
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,059
thousand dollars more for a single

550
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,059
credential than if you don't have that

551
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,400
information that's because that Sim swap

552
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,140
is so important you can do so much with

553
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,260
that

554
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,500
so here we are with the uh that log

555
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,620
that l0 gz in this case you've got a

556
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,480
file at the end of that directory Chase

557
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,299
Falls underscore email dot text and in

558
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,740
this bit of code they're opening that

559
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,380
file so we can we can deem from this

560
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,840
that this is where that server is

561
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,640
storing all of the credentials that are

562
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,299
being fished

563
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,940
now we're going to take a look at the

564
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,620
config file these guys are pretty good

565
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,059
developers they have config files they

566
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,940
do a bunch of different stuff uh so here

567
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,220
we can see that we know that the that

568
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,900
the threat actor is is collecting

569
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
phished credentials here we can see that

570
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
he's going to email those threat those

571
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,840
credentials off to this email account

572
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,580
now here's another point in the kill

573
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,860
chain right so if you think about it you

574
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,240
take the phone number that sent the text

575
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,700
you whack the domain down

576
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,320
and now you kill this email there's

577
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,640
three points in the kill chain that you

578
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,400
hit I guarantee you that email account

579
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,640
is not just on one URL

580
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,160
one if you think about it one kit could

581
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,980
be responsible for a thousand URLs so if

582
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,320
you kill this there's a thousand other

583
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,820
domains that you or a thousand other

584
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,340
fishings that you've uh you've mitigated

585
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,039
uh save to host one so they've enabled

586
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,720
this so we know that they're saving the

587
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,660
files down and then take a look at this

588
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,880
exit link so the exit link is to

589
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,940
chase.com so at any point in this

590
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,880
phishing attack if you either don't meet

591
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,780
a standard or if you complete a fill out

592
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,240
of a form the next piece that you get

593
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,039
hit with is this exit link and it's

594
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
going to pitch you off to the chase.com

595
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
and we're going to come back to that in

596
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,720
a second

597
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,120
if you look about halfway down you've

598
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,320
got an enable antibots so if this were

599
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,539
enabled here's another point in the kill

600
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,400
chain because you would have an API key

601
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,160
to antibodies and what antibods is is it

602
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,559
it's a it's an organization that

603
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,740
collects uh ways that that Bots are used

604
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,240
um these are like spiders that go out

605
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,740
and in spite of the internet and things

606
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,140
like that and they if you have that

607
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,120
enabled and you have the key then you're

608
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,340
blocking all of that so if this were

609
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,860
enabled and you've got that key and you

610
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,480
are coming from a bot you would exit out

611
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,220
to that chase.com

612
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,159
uh you've got geolocation USA visitors

613
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,320
only this is disabled but we see this

614
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,620
enabled a lot I will tell you that we

615
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,299
are tracking a threat actor right now

616
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,659
that is geolocating his fishing to his

617
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,240
cities so he will find a specific City

618
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,419
and only folks on IP addresses in that

619
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,220
City can render that phishing page

620
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,500
everybody else gets pitched to Google

621
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,260
uh mobile only equals one I'm sorry I'm

622
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,000
going fast we got a lot of data to cover

623
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,020
so

624
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,600
um mobile only equals one so this is

625
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,539
saying that on this particular fish you

626
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,159
have to be on a mobile device on a

627
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,200
mobile UA in order to get that page to

628
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
render so now you can start to put

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
together wow there's a lot going on

630
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,340
inside this code maybe your sock or or

631
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,039
your threat analyst group is trying to

632
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,539
render efficient or using a desktop

633
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,159
browser and they're going to you and

634
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,380
saying I can't get to it or you're

635
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,539
pitching it to your takedown vendor they

636
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,799
don't know about this and they're saying

637
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,120
well the site's already down I get

638
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,860
pitched to Google Now the site's still

639
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,260
live you got to use a mobile UA

640
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,059
so we're going to pause on crypto we'll

641
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,679
come back we'll show you how active they

642
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,760
are and we're going to move over to

643
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,900
another threat actor that we've seen

644
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,780
over the last 18 months uh Mr wiebe Mr

645
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,280
weeby

646
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't know where they come up with

647
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,960
these names

648
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,179
so Mr wiebe has been 18 months he's been

649
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,880
running uh very prolific in the SMS

650
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,740
fishing

651
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,260
um area and here's the config file so

652
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,659
here we're uh we're logging users if you

653
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,039
take a look at what they're logging in

654
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,780
that user so they're logging your user

655
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,520
agent and your IP address with a date

656
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,740
that feeds directly into that anti-back

657
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,220
so you see that anti-back equals one if

658
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,960
you go to that page

659
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,659
and you come off of that page and then

660
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,400
you try to go back to that page from the

661
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,740
same IP that blocks you

662
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,039
so think about you your your escalation

663
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,500
path that hits your sock or it hits uh

664
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,780
somebody in your organization they go to

665
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,760
it they pitch it over to the threat

666
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,140
analyst the thread analysts go to and

667
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,419
you're like there's nothing here

668
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,159
um so you can see their sophistication

669
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,039
is is kind of getting here uh send email

670
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,320
is set to one so they're sending all of

671
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,780
the compromise credentials off they're

672
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,820
also saving the results

673
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,419
telegram one so here we know that in

674
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,159
this case the third thing that they're

675
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,720
doing they're sending an email with the

676
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,039
credentials they're saving the

677
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,480
credentials to the host and they're

678
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,100
posting their credentials on Telegram in

679
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,980
a in a closed Channel and you can see

680
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,440
that down with that chat ID

681
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,039
um

682
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,940
there so that is the telegram chat ID

683
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,140
and I think we're going to look at that

684
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,120
chat ID next right yes so we're going to

685
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,799
take this chat ID use that as a pivot

686
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,419
point across a database of kits and see

687
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,760
how prolific is this chat ID across

688
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,100
other unique kits and each kit that we

689
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900
characterize and index is hash with the

690
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,059
shot 256 level I think the most common

691
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,559
difference that we see between the same

692
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,580
kit that might have a different

693
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,919
iteration it's the actual method so

694
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,240
whether it's a different email address

695
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,600
or a different chat ID we tend to see

696
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,860
the same nuts and bolts with just

697
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,080
different details also another Link in

698
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,940
the kill chain so if we think about that

699
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,620
so one of the reasons that we did this

700
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,480
before we we actually execute this the

701
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,460
search one of the reasons we did this is

702
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,559
we found that some threat actors were

703
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,580
staying below a a monetary gain so that

704
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,260
federal law enforcement would not get

705
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,840
involved because of that that lost

706
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,500
monies is below a certain amount it's

707
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,240
not enough to trigger FBI to get

708
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,220
involved but what we were able to talk

709
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,780
with federal law enforcement about was

710
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,080
what if what if we have for instance a

711
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,460
threat actor that's hitting Target and

712
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,860
Walmart and between the two of them

713
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,600
because we can paint the picture with

714
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,120
kits that it raises it above would you

715
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,220
then open up a federal case well yeah

716
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,020
because now the total monetary loss is

717
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,179
above it so think about this if you guys

718
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,620
want to do if you're working for an

719
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,000
organization

720
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,620
um and you want to do threat actor

721
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,659
attribution but you can't get that raise

722
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,299
if you're doing something like this now

723
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,740
you can say well wait a minute there's

724
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,059
you know this company over here let's

725
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,120
reach out to them collaborate and and

726
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,860
raise that money value up so we get

727
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,299
federal law enforcement

728
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,580
so we take a look at this content we do

729
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,419
that search this chat number shows up in

730
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,460
38 kits and if you look at who they're

731
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,799
attacking it goes across the board so

732
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,360
now think about what I was just saying

733
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,700
if we get two of these companies to

734
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,919
start working together it raises that

735
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,740
value but also think in the kill chain

736
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,360
if we kill that bot or that channel ID

737
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,880
if we go to Telegram and say take this

738
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,400
offline it takes all of these kits

739
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,559
offline now they you can't do anything

740
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,419
with that and let's say each one of

741
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,500
these is responsible for 100 URLs now

742
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,179
you've done a lot of damage with one one

743
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,080
Link in a kill chain

744
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,640
this just goes on and on and on

745
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,860
so here's the the actual uh API key used

746
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,960
for the the bot

747
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,179
um to type the telegram and we're going

748
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,159
to take a look at that

749
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,980
we do this search we're in 35 kits

750
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,080
another Link in the kill chain so

751
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
sometimes when you're when you're

752
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,260
parsing through kits and you're looking

753
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,539
at this you may not have the chat ID or

754
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,240
the chat ID is added uh post deployment

755
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,000
before or after they get the the site

756
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,460
live on the site but you might have this

757
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,440
this API key

758
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,360
um so it's it's understanding what's

759
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,520
happening in the kit and looking at it

760
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,919
from a view of I can kill here here here

761
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,919
and here or I can recover credentials

762
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
from here here here here can you go back

763
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,880
a sign are you going to say something

764
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,760
about this go back one more one more

765
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,880
um

766
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,279
this can be reverse engineered to get

767
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,159
into that channel and to recover those

768
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,020
credentials I'm not condoning

769
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,179
doing anything bad but you can't get

770
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,820
into that if you wanted to

771
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,960
now we're going to take a look at some

772
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,159
of the extensive bot blocking

773
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,140
capabilities and the different evasion

774
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,480
methods they they employ to keep their

775
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,460
campaign online as long as possible

776
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,820
threat actors do a lot to block

777
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,340
people who are trying to catch them from

778
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,919
seeing what they're doing and they put a

779
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,419
lot of effort the other thing I will

780
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,760
tell you and and this is is something

781
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,679
it's near and dear to my heart because I

782
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,380
talk to a lot of organizations

783
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,559
um I I a lot of organizations and what

784
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,500
I've found is that legal teams inside

785
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,980
these organizations they don't

786
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,260
um support for lack of better terms

787
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,940
sharing information with other

788
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,500
organizations especially if you're in

789
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,299
competition with them so if we if we go

790
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,980
back to my analogy of Walmart and Target

791
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,600
they're not going to share a bunch of

792
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
information because you know they're

793
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,860
competing against each other threat

794
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,799
actors they share everything I've been

795
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,179
in channels where a threat actor will

796
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,620
say hey you want to run a Netflix

797
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,740
campaign over sms use this carrier don't

798
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,080
use that carrier they make it all public

799
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,659
they share these bot files

800
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,460
all the time and whenever somebody

801
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,559
updates one they put it back out

802
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,200
here's keyword blocking it's just a list

803
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,600
of keywords that we go through and if

804
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,179
any of those keywords gets picked up by

805
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,820
the web page

806
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,919
it kicks the person out

807
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,039
um

808
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,840
going down to the next one so here we

809
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,880
see more keywords

810
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,500
too fast on that so here we see Amazon

811
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,600
you see Amazon in there you see crawler

812
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,320
fish tank dreamhost all of this so so

813
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,380
this is a way that again the threat

814
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,020
actors are trying to keep people from

815
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,120
discovering them

816
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,739
who are trying to shut them down

817
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,720
the last piece we're going to talk about

818
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,179
is IP addresses this file gets really

819
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,820
really interesting here in a few seconds

820
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,620
so you can see they're blocking a lot of

821
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,679
IP addresses but as we started going

822
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,260
through this what we found was this bit

823
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,700
of code right here

824
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,179
so this is base64 encoded and and what

825
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,299
we found here so here we're working with

826
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,380
um a a kit developer and a kit operator

827
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,659
so in this case the kit developer is

828
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,460
putting his kits up for sale the kit

829
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,419
operator buys them for 150 200 bucks uh

830
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,220
the the kit developer says thanks come

831
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,799
again and off he goes when we decode

832
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,240
this

833
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,640
we see another exfiltration no honor

834
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,980
among Thieves so here

835
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,919
the kit developer is getting all of the

836
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,559
credentials for everybody who buys this

837
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,178
kit sent back to them as well

838
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,919
so if we think about how specific you

839
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
can be to to avoid being detected or to

840
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,380
not render a certain web page

841
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,580
keywords and IP addresses are certainly

842
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,440
a broad place to start but what if you

843
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,480
could get down to the user agent so you

844
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,159
have to fit within a certain screen size

845
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
and what do we have on screen here

846
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,220
here we go there so here you have to

847
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,799
have a screen width of 6.99 in order to

848
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,500
render the page for this U.S Bank fish

849
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,620
it's a it's a bit of java JavaScript and

850
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,200
this gets even more in depth um as as we

851
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,020
go to the next threat actor

852
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
um

853
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
so here we ran across some some kits

854
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,039
that were the only way I can explain it

855
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,740
is you know we deployed it or we

856
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,779
deemed as canvas

857
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,940
um so as we go through this this is

858
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,820
another uh example of

859
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,399
where you have to have a screen width of

860
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,240
uh 6.99 so this is a modular kit modular

861
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,059
is the threat the kit developer in this

862
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,779
instance

863
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,299
so here we see you know more of the same

864
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,940
you've got an email account you've got

865
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,980
um you know they're they're crafting the

866
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,440
email here to send the files and the log

867
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,799
file down there it's logs.txt they also

868
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,220
they also above the logs.txt what you'll

869
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,559
see is visitors so this this is the

870
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,419
other thing anybody who clicks on that

871
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,460
link anybody who clicks on that link

872
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,520
they get listed as a visitor uh I I was

873
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,320
out at a conference talking to the state

874
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,080
AGS and uh one of the things they were

875
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,760
talking about one of the state agencies

876
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,799
you know we don't know how many people

877
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,559
are clicking one of the things we do is

878
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,720
collect a lot of this information and we

879
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,179
built a nice little map uh and we pulled

880
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,700
up California at the time and it just it

881
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,779
flooded with a whole bunch of

882
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,940
information they're like wow that's a

883
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,460
lot of clicks so yeah what we've what we

884
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,020
understand people are happy clickers

885
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,020
they love to click on things

886
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,220
and we're going to break down this

887
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,320
modular kit a little bit this one gets a

888
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,760
little bit more sophisticated in how

889
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,399
they're blocking so here we've got a uh

890
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,980
uh it's a code 19 Trace out of the UK

891
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,440
modular operates mostly in the UK

892
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,700
and what we see here is they're going to

893
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,520
start really breaking down how they look

894
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,940
at who is visiting that site pay

895
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,240
attention to uh these lines here

896
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
because we're going to come back to

897
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
those that debug info and that vendor

898
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,520
info here you can see they're looking at

899
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,039
they've got variables for screen width

900
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,419
screen height and they've got another

901
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,640
one for color depth who would have

902
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,260
thought that

903
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,480
um here you so they're looking to see

904
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,700
are you using an RDP machine are you

905
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,860
already peeing into a machine and then

906
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,080
detonating that site so you know if you

907
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,440
think about how threat groups work very

908
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,020
few of us will sit on our laptops and go

909
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,240
to nasty places on the internet we

910
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,799
normally use a virtual machine or

911
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,299
something like that this is trying to

912
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,860
detect that here they're looking at

913
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,419
color depth they're looking at width

914
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,659
again they're doing bot detects and then

915
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,039
if we go down here

916
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,899
they're trying to find out are you using

917
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,820
selenium are you using a headless

918
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,679
browser if you're using this information

919
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,539
or if you're using this technology I

920
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,980
should say then we're going to kick you

921
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,539
out as well

922
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,220
they're looking to find out do you have

923
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,880
a real display

924
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,899
so now we're going to Pivot off of those

925
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,700
two pieces of code again you start to

926
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,260
see a pattern how prolific is this one

927
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,940
fingerprint to you and we could use that

928
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,640
as a pivot point so we have 105 files

929
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,039
contain those same lines of code that

930
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,980
was pulled from the previous screenshot

931
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,740
and again this is mostly UK this was a

932
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,419
lot of package delivery a lot of

933
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,539
covid-19 stuff I think we did see some

934
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,000
banks in there and the UK government

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,620
they were attacking the UK government

936
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,140
pretty hard

937
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,179
the UK's version of the IRS I can't

938
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,380
remember what it's called off top my

939
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,500
head

940
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,399
so this brings us back to the original

941
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,500
screenshot so we saw crypto on telegram

942
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,599
so if we took that same application I'm

943
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,040
trying to Pivot off of a certain string

944
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,659
of code figure out how prolific is

945
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,399
crypto who else are they targeting in my

946
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,500
area in my ecosystem

947
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,119
um which ttps are they are they

948
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,379
leveraging against other companies does

949
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,540
that match what we're trying to do so we

950
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,679
think a kit can just tell a more

951
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,300
powerful story other than how quickly a

952
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,040
domain was was taken down to understand

953
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,379
who was behind the kit where that victim

954
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,820
data is going and then where else are

955
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,359
they attacking

956
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,619
so if we take this just forward slash

957
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,780
crypto on Telegram and do that content

958
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,000
search we're going to see 512 files that

959
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
have that same exact signature so

960
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,940
whether they're advertising their Wares

961
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,099
or it's for bragging rights

962
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,599
um this is just another fingerprint that

963
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,159
allows us to understand the scope of

964
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
their their campaigns it's it's

965
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
interesting to note in this search right

966
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,460
now so when we do searches like this

967
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,160
we're looking for uniqueness right so

968
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,280
although we're finding this

969
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,900
this string in the actual kit the kits

970
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,920
are different there's something

971
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,200
different in that kit so this is just

972
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,740
shows you how how prolific this guy is

973
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,200
so if we dropped some of the you know

974
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,599
the forward slashes and on telegram to

975
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,980
see how what if we just searched on

976
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,020
crypto does those results change so we

977
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,599
have 512 hits with crypto on telegram

978
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,579
but if we move forward just a little bit

979
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,800
we have over 1200 results so at some

980
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,480
point their marketing message changed to

981
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,460
the other developers in the community

982
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,380
um and so again everything inside of a

983
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,400
kit is a pivot point to better

984
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,440
understand who's behind the campaign and

985
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,420
where the information is going

986
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
um

987
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,180
I I didn't hear that say that again

988
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,160
I

989
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,260
ease of use I would say

990
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,540
um the the mobile aspect of it it's very

991
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,300
easy to uh set up a private Channel and

992
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,859
a bot and have that bot right to that

993
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,420
private Channel

994
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,240
um you know kind of like

995
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,380
telegram's not the only one telegram's

996
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,780
the example we hear we see uh Discord

997
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,900
being used uh IRC

998
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,320
um icq believe it or not is still being

999
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,460
used

1000
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,160
um but but Telegram in this one is very

1001
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,839
prolific with these threat actors

1002
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,700
we're trying to educate companies to to

1003
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,140
mitigate this

1004
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,640
um I will tell you we've been successful

1005
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,099
in mitigating it when uh we've been

1006
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,260
charged with doing so uh we've worked

1007
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,660
with federal law enforcement to

1008
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,839
um to to try and and infiltrate some of

1009
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,980
those I know that federal law

1010
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,839
enforcements had some trouble getting

1011
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,320
telegram to uh cooperate but uh we've

1012
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,599
had some success with telegram I will

1013
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,240
tell you in telegram so unlike Discord

1014
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm getting off topic here but that's

1015
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,359
okay

1016
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,660
um unlike Discord and Discord if you are

1017
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,160
a threat actor and you're operating at

1018
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,079
Discord you have to prove yourself time

1019
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,599
and time again to get to a higher place

1020
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,540
in a Channel or invited to a higher

1021
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,040
place to a channel where more and more

1022
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,560
stuff's revealed on telegram I would say

1023
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,839
telegram's more like the script Kitty uh

1024
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,820
place to do things so on telegram all

1025
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,619
you have to do is say I want to join and

1026
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,420
people out there will brag the other

1027
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,460
thing on telegram that we see a lot of

1028
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,280
is let me show you how to do this let me

1029
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,859
show you how to do SMS campaigns let me

1030
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,260
let me share with you

1031
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,780
um the the software that I built to send

1032
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,540
SMS campaigns uh and and a lot of

1033
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,119
bragging on there but again I I I get

1034
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,560
the feeling that it's more script Kitty

1035
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,180
stuff these are the lower level actors

1036
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,640
that are that are doing this the the the

1037
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,839
bigger threat actors or the the state

1038
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,700
attacks the state level attacks

1039
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,220
um that seems to be more handled on

1040
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,160
Discord or private channels uh Elsewhere

1041
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,420
on the dark web

1042
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,220
um than they are on here

1043
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,320
I hope that answered your question as

1044
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,099
best I could

1045
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,240
so we sized up crypto and how active

1046
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,980
they are uh we mentioned Mr weeby

1047
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,599
earlier so I think with crypto at most

1048
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,460
we saw 1200 results if we did that same

1049
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,500
content search across the database to

1050
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,599
see how active Mr weeby is we're

1051
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,460
approaching almost 4 000 files that has

1052
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,339
that signature uh Mr weeby in it and so

1053
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,720
I think when we talked earlier these

1054
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
smaller campaigns targeting a longer

1055
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,300
tail

1056
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,839
um in particular Mr WIBI has clearly

1057
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,700
um expedited or made an efficient

1058
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,140
process to replicate the latest version

1059
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,980
of the websites at scale this guy's got

1060
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,320
a lot of kits um if you take a look at

1061
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,579
this um

1062
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,160
in in what we're seeing here you know

1063
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,280
some of these organizations uh are large

1064
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,220
organizations like you see GTE there

1065
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,560
um you see M T Bank you see uh Fifth and

1066
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
Third and then you see some smaller

1067
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,220
Credit Unions that are in there

1068
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,220
um but I will tell you he is selling a

1069
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,680
lot of kits he moves his shop quite

1070
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,160
often too

1071
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,599
and a lot of these guys another point of

1072
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,339
note a lot of these guys

1073
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,320
um they operate on the open net on a

1074
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,359
clarinet so when they set up their shops

1075
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,800
they set them up right on the clarinet

1076
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,359
you don't have to be on a dark net or or

1077
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,820
do anything you just go in there you can

1078
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,280
pay with whatever means you want

1079
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
um and it's interesting to to

1080
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,859
to follow the money

1081
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm trying to see how I say this I'm

1082
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,660
sure what happens sometimes is somebody

1083
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,880
will fish a credit card and use that to

1084
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,200
buy other kits

1085
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I'll just put it that way

1086
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,180
so after Mr weeby and Krypto there's

1087
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,440
another name that's been prolific over

1088
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,079
the last 18 months and that's box and

1089
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,000
another good uh example of the threat

1090
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,260
actor signature

1091
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,240
and their rules for deploying their kits

1092
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,900
can you I'm sorry can you go back up one

1093
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,940
I learned every time I look at a kid I

1094
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,060
see something new uh go to the next page

1095
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,520
look at the the different types of

1096
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,160
blocking he's got here he's got an IP

1097
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,579
block list a bot crawler a bot Spock

1098
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,839
something that he's developed himself

1099
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,180
another Blacklist it looks like

1100
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,800
um and he's including all of this these

1101
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,599
guys go through very

1102
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,859
very

1103
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,260
stringent methods to to keep good guys

1104
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,359
from from finding them sorry I just

1105
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,900
noticed that

1106
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,079
so uh this this is an interesting note

1107
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,900
um a lot of times when we're talking to

1108
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,640
organizations and they say you know

1109
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
where can I find out who's fishing me we

1110
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,820
ask them to look take a look at your

1111
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,540
referral logs who what is referring to

1112
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,640
your website as we saw with the

1113
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,220
chase.com you know and Chase looks at

1114
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
their referral logs they'll probably

1115
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,160
pick up that phishing page do you want

1116
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,540
to refer to them

1117
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,599
here this threat actor is saying haha

1118
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,740
I'm not going to let you do that what

1119
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,420
I'm going to do is I'm going to go to

1120
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,859
this cutley site which then will

1121
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,780
redirect me to the chase site because

1122
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,320
this cutley does redirect to chase.com

1123
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,880
uh so now what do they say no furlogs

1124
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,500
they they see Cutlass so these guys are

1125
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,260
always thinking we picked this up

1126
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,180
on the thread actor Channel where they

1127
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,859
were saying no no no no do it like this

1128
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,020
guys if you do it like this

1129
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,880
less chance less chance you'll get

1130
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,540
caught

1131
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,859
so most of the kits that we've looked at

1132
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,780
so far are targeting consumers or

1133
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,060
customers I think over the last month or

1134
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,380
two we've seen some headlines about

1135
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,460
certain

1136
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,560
um widely used applications targeting

1137
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,780
employee credentials specifically single

1138
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,599
sign-on as one method to instead of

1139
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,760
looking for the the personal identify

1140
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,619
identifiable information of a consumer

1141
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,800
what if you just need user user username

1142
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,720
and password to access the company

1143
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,459
Network I'm the nervous one remember

1144
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,560
uh so here's an example of one kit that

1145
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,240
we had initially picked up and what

1146
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,320
makes this a little bit different we saw

1147
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,300
a lot of PHP files in the previous kits

1148
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,339
Ben what do you see here so here they're

1149
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,040
using Django to deploy this kit

1150
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,480
um so you see a lot of python in there

1151
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,599
uh and and this was it

1152
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,760
this was interesting when we first we

1153
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
first started digging into this and

1154
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,420
we've dug a lot further uh since this

1155
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,980
presentation put together the other

1156
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,420
thing to take note on here is towards

1157
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,880
the bottom you see two exe files I don't

1158
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,000
know what those exe files are but I'm

1159
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,140
going to go find out after this

1160
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,940
conference because that's no bueno

1161
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,060
so here's telegram again uh you know

1162
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,099
another telegram bot

1163
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:35,820
um

1164
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,320
another point in the kill chain

1165
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,980
so we're we've talked about pivot Points

1166
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,480
um favicons

1167
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,460
so people wouldn't think that a favicon

1168
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,800
could be a pivot point uh but when we

1169
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,980
hash the favicons on this and we did a

1170
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,760
search on that shot 256 hash uh we found

1171
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,400
two kits were using that favicon

1172
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,619
so we had the one and then this one

1173
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,720
which was T-Mobile

1174
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,079
so this this is uh part of that single

1175
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,940
sign on as everyone here should probably

1176
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,579
know that OCTA is a single sign-on if

1177
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,220
you were using OCTA uh I would really

1178
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,140
pay attention to fishing especially

1179
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,940
right now the amount of stuff that we're

1180
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,800
seeing Target OCTA right now the amount

1181
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,420
of new domains

1182
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,700
that are being stood up with the word

1183
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,000
OCTA and it is a little bit alarming

1184
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,900
um

1185
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,880
so here we're going to break apart this

1186
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,440
because we wanted to figure out what is

1187
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,300
it that they're doing now in in this

1188
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,619
case

1189
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,720
um you know there's no monetary gain

1190
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,040
here you're not going to get credit

1191
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,839
cards that they can sell and get

1192
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,160
usernames and passwords that they could

1193
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,859
sell but what was the point of this so

1194
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,599
the point of this

1195
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,619
um I think we're going to see it in the

1196
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,079
the config file here yeah in the config

1197
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,119
file here the point of this is the

1198
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,560
threat actor is just trying to gain

1199
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,119
employee credentials here so it's not

1200
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,520
business email compromise what they want

1201
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,980
is back-end systems they either want

1202
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,400
accounting systems HR systems or any

1203
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,560
type of system that can do provisioning

1204
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,800
in the cases that we were seeing in Octa

1205
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,380
that we were doing investigations on it

1206
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,660
was all the last part they were trying

1207
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,260
to do some sort of provisioning whether

1208
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,300
it's you know in the case of chemo or

1209
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,440
are they trying to provision phone

1210
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,740
numbers are they trying to

1211
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,300
provision accounts so that they can go

1212
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,700
into a store and and you know do some

1213
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,680
swapping we don't know

1214
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,960
um but I will tell you that that this

1215
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,040
one um was alarming another note on this

1216
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,440
prior to single sign one when we saw

1217
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,140
attacks happening on large organizations

1218
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,819
where they were trying to get into the

1219
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,579
back end of organizations we went to a

1220
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:48,599
company and said listen you're being

1221
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,480
targeted and we were talking to the I

1222
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,460
think it was the CTO at that point and

1223
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,599
you know we were saying you know we got

1224
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:55,800
to do something we got to mitigate this

1225
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,619
it was all coming over SMS and it was

1226
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,619
targeting all of their employees and uh

1227
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,839
the the CTO at that point says I know

1228
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,819
what we'll do we'll change the website

1229
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,800
so they completely ripped the website

1230
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,599
down and stood up a whole new website

1231
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,579
all new CSS all new color schemes

1232
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,040
everything 24 hours later that site was

1233
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,780
being deployed as phishing sites 24

1234
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,300
hours later and and we you know we're

1235
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,700
standing there we're like okay

1236
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,319
you really got to start thinking this

1237
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,300
thing through because changing things it

1238
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,180
is so easy to rip a site and stand up a

1239
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,220
new one that that's not going to do

1240
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,599
anything so this is where we really

1241
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,000
started heading down this kill chain

1242
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,500
methodology that we were thinking and if

1243
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,180
we go back and kind of cover this again

1244
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,220
you know email accounts

1245
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,680
phone numbers

1246
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,720
API Keys whether it's a bot API key a

1247
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,500
telegram API key

1248
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,839
domains email accounts if I didn't say

1249
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,880
that already anything that you can kill

1250
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,060
in that you should kill

1251
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,680
domains where you you need to absolutely

1252
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,040
take the domain down killing an API key

1253
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,339
has a much broader effect than

1254
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,500
doing a domain because you're now

1255
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,260
fighting I will tell you email SMS the

1256
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,660
largest attack I saw was

1257
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,880
um targeting a bank and in 15 20 minutes

1258
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,359
I think we saw something like 280

1259
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,240
000 unique urls

1260
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,040
um on those unique URLs it was probably

1261
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,260
about 70 domains

1262
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,359
and that took just that amount of time

1263
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,880
to get out and and playing whack-a-mole

1264
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,220
with those domains to get that mitigated

1265
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,540
well guess what they're already on the

1266
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,460
handsets I mean people are already

1267
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,520
clicking on that and think about this

1268
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,380
um if you're going to take a domain down

1269
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,540
and you go to a registrar that's going

1270
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,000
into an abuse box that abuse box then

1271
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,440
needs to get picked up by an analyst

1272
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,020
they then need to vet that abuse once

1273
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,480
they vet that abuse then they put it in

1274
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,220
for takedown and I think it goes into

1275
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,680
suspension for like 15 days and and then

1276
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,900
it goes down it's way too late way too

1277
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,079
late

1278
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,000
so it's not all doom and gloom I think

1279
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,079
at this point we know what the table

1280
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,940
Stakes are for an effective anti-fishing

1281
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,339
program through user awareness but as as

1282
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,079
anything involves you know what can we

1283
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,460
leave you with just for things to think

1284
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,720
about whether this is something that's

1285
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,060
familiar to you such as CEO scams or

1286
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,680
you're hearing about your peers complain

1287
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,300
about these campaigns

1288
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,800
um just because of how quickly these

1289
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,240
threat actors are moving uh moving

1290
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,099
around

1291
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,200
not to put any fear or uncertainty out

1292
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,599
there but it could happen and so just to

1293
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,339
think about it it's a little bit easier

1294
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,480
if we could have that proactive

1295
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,760
discussion if you just think about the

1296
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,960
intelligence that your teams are already

1297
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,339
collecting whether you're an individual

1298
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,960
analyst or a sock team or you're

1299
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,339
fortunate to have resources such as

1300
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,859
brand protection feeds coming in but

1301
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,359
just taking stock of what intelligence

1302
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,579
you are collecting both internal and

1303
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,319
external so we know that the report of

1304
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,819
fish button is effective if you give

1305
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,200
them an opportunity to report it they

1306
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,720
will if you could apply that same to CEO

1307
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,520
scams how many more messages would you

1308
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,960
be likely likely to see from your

1309
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,300
employees and then customer support we

1310
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,740
found that most effective customer

1311
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,020
support teams have a method to collect

1312
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,720
this SMS intelligence and voice call so

1313
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,819
things such as the user experience where

1314
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,560
they imitating our bank or maybe our

1315
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,200
card holder what would they how do they

1316
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,700
present themselves what was the content

1317
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
of the message because I think it was

1318
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,420
someone mentioned earlier How likely are

1319
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,220
these organizations who are hosting the

1320
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,140
phishing or hosting the phone number I

1321
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,359
think everyone wants to keep their side

1322
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,220
of the street clean and so if we can

1323
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,480
figure out the appropriate way to Route

1324
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,400
the abuse more often than not you're

1325
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,660
going to be you know you're going to be

1326
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,760
thanked in action will be taken and then

1327
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,980
just acknowledging that does do the

1328
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,000
channels that we offer and the

1329
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,200
information that we collect are we

1330
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,599
identifying SMS voice and traditional

1331
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,400
email so I think over the last month or

1332
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,660
two we're having more conversations

1333
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,579
where the institution says geez August

1334
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,380
was the first time that we had more SMS

1335
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,819
fishing complaints than we had

1336
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,740
traditional and that was the first you

1337
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,060
know that was the first time that we you

1338
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,240
know that they've experienced that

1339
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,760
we also find ourselves educating we saw

1340
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,859
the the evasion techniques around mobile

1341
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,280
only or geolog sites you know do you or

1342
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,140
your team or your existing vendors have

1343
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,000
the ability to try multiple user agent

1344
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,859
strings try multiple IP addresses

1345
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:08,460
whether it's a VPN or or a carrier IP so

1346
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,720
they can see that landing page and

1347
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,119
Report the abuse abuse effectively and

1348
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,500
then the opportunity for more than just

1349
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,020
a URL takedown so understand what

1350
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,819
delivery channel that this SMS number

1351
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,859
come from or the voice call was it a to

1352
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,740
P was it a short code just acknowledging

1353
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,180
that you can take down a mobile number

1354
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,579
tends to be one of the first Aqua parts

1355
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,140
of a conversation when people ask about

1356
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,240
is it all spoofed the answer is more

1357
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,700
often than not it's not spoofed so just

1358
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,260
trying to debunk some of those myths

1359
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,240
around you know what's the use of going

1360
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,040
after some of these phone numbers

1361
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,900
and then I think we can again we're at

1362
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,160
the place where we can start thinking

1363
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,660
about which fishing kit was behind this

1364
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,680
campaign

1365
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,000
um we are all familiar with the URL

1366
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,500
takedown process but just to hold our

1367
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,359
vendors accountable to say what else can

1368
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,800
you tell me about this threat actor when

1369
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,940
you start to see the same domain

1370
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,619
structure being spun up for typo

1371
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,240
squatting you can start to think about

1372
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,160
the same fishing kit being applied so

1373
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,260
what if that same fishing kit was across

1374
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,960
20 domains with the same X bill you

1375
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,859
could just start to build a more

1376
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,180
powerful story than buying more

1377
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,440
takedowns

1378
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,940
um so I realize we have 10 minutes to go

1379
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,740
I can't say enough about Ben's passion

1380
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,720
to help others are there any questions

1381
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,460
at this point based on your experience

1382
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,140
or things about mobile or kits in

1383
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,460
general yes sir

1384
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,640
yes

1385
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,660
I

1386
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,119
so I had to be careful on what I say due

1387
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,940
to contractual that data is being used

1388
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,359
I'll say that then and it's uh it's very

1389
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,640
interesting so if you if you don't know

1390
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,339
um the way that you report before this

1391
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,099
apple thing uh the way that you report

1392
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:47,940
SMS scams or phishing or or spam was you

1393
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,940
had to forward that message to 7726

1394
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,920
which back in the olden days it spells

1395
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,599
spam on the keyboard

1396
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,400
who would have thought of that

1397
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,980
um but that that user interaction to do

1398
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,859
that is is very tough right so you have

1399
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,359
to forward it then you get a message

1400
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,220
back that says can you tell me the

1401
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,540
sender then you have to go back to the

1402
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,160
message and you say oh the sender number

1403
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,720
was this this this and it might get fat

1404
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,980
fingered

1405
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,780
um and and then it goes It goes back and

1406
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,099
forth and then that goes back to the

1407
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:15,960
carriers and the carriers work in that

1408
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,640
with this Apple data it lists it

1409
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,280
directly off of the off of the um device

1410
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,540
so

1411
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,059
uh I've seen that data that data is very

1412
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,760
very uh

1413
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,839
detailed and it's very very good and it

1414
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,819
is a lot so yeah

1415
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,740
I don't know I would tell you having

1416
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,140
having been in this space for you know

1417
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,480
the past 22 years carriers do not like

1418
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,220
to share data

1419
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,380
um strictly because of the pii that can

1420
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,480
be in there

1421
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,760
and you know if all of a sudden you

1422
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,020
realize wait a minute is somebody

1423
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,240
looking at my text messages you know

1424
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,859
then people are really going to be up in

1425
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,780
arms and they should be we don't want

1426
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,540
people reading our text messages

1427
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,180
that answer your question

1428
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,160
and I can't see from the bright light so

1429
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,500
if anybody else has questions

1430
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,980
sure

1431
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,520
so if if you're talking about related to

1432
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,960
fishing short codes

1433
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,579
short codes is the way to go but here's

1434
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,380
what I'll tell you about short codes

1435
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,240
um if a company buys a short code if

1436
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,059
you're Pepsi Cola if Pepsi Cola buys a

1437
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:38,099
short code to do a marketing campaign I

1438
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:39,240
guarantee you that the threat

1439
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,680
intelligence group doesn't know what

1440
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,359
that short code is because they're not

1441
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,280
they're not talking across so they don't

1442
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,040
know you know how to handle that

1443
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,240
did that answer your question

1444
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,819
if you want to grab me afterwards we can

1445
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,040
we can get a little bit more detail

1446
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,579
okay

1447
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,558
I'm trying to understand the questions

1448
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,839
biggest like all traffic routing all

1449
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,940
traffic there's

1450
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,480
operate

1451
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,720
the back end against the

1452
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,359
yeah so so would that works the question

1453
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,400
was routing all traffic through a secure

1454
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,780
Gateway

1455
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,640
um to try and weed this out is that is

1456
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,879
that correct

1457
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,040
yeah yeah they'll never do that uh so

1458
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,319
yeah I I get what you're saying and

1459
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,920
on an actual mobile device oh yeah you

1460
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,319
could um you know certainly doing stuff

1461
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,000
like that would work

1462
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,720
um

1463
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,460
but now you've got to what are you what

1464
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,140
are you going to do with BYOD

1465
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,260
because I you know I tell you when my

1466
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,700
company comes to me and says hey you

1467
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,200
know we want to install something on

1468
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,480
your phone no

1469
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,300
sorry I don't know what that is um and

1470
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,980
that and I get very nervous about things

1471
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,960
but yeah you you could potentially do

1472
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,480
something like that

1473
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,700
anybody else

1474
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,500
so real quickly

1475
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,720
um we've got five minutes and I wanted

1476
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,220
to end on this note

1477
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,000
um

1478
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,339
why we got passionate about fishing kits

1479
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:41,400
uh probably a couple of years ago as we

1480
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,359
were collecting fishing kits and

1481
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:43,800
starting this dive we got a call from

1482
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,079
the Met police in London and I met

1483
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,300
police were doing an investigation

1484
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,520
um on somebody who was doing large SMS

1485
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,920
companion campaigns against the the

1486
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,559
government of the UK as well as some of

1487
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,020
the banks and they had stalled on their

1488
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,880
investigation and they knew that we were

1489
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,020
because we've been talking with them

1490
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,760
they knew that we had kids so they they

1491
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,740
sent us over their threat intelligence

1492
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,660
and we had kids

1493
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,260
um

1494
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,240
so we started tearing apart those kits

1495
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,099
and one of one of the threat analysts or

1496
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,059
one of the threat Hunters that works for

1497
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,920
me says I've got something

1498
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,839
and what he did was when the threat

1499
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,079
actor was building the kit uh on his

1500
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:22,200
laptop he decided to test his kit well

1501
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,420
he forgot to turn his VPN on and he

1502
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,099
logged all of that data and then he

1503
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,260
zipped that kid up and he set it up we

1504
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,119
grabbed it and pulled it down so we

1505
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,440
pulled it down we're like okay we've got

1506
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,359
IP information inside this kit that he

1507
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,400
had logged we looked at the IPS and said

1508
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,680
well these aren't vpns sent them over to

1509
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,420
the Met police the Met police found it

1510
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,940
kicked in the door now the funniest the

1511
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,760
funny story here is uh the guy was

1512
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,180
living in a basement of his mom's house

1513
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,220
um

1514
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,319
yeah and

1515
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,720
I I I I can't make this up but but the

1516
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,720
funnier thing is is you know he had this

1517
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,819
really leak name that he was going by

1518
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,099
and one of the things that we found well

1519
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,960
first off they found an open laptop he

1520
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,520
was working on the kit that we had

1521
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,380
supplied to the Met police at the time

1522
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,000
so they matched the code up and they're

1523
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,040
like yeah you're going to jail buddy

1524
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,720
um but the funniest thing was when the

1525
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,640
guys called us and saying hey we just

1526
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,099
executed the the the search warrant

1527
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,720
we've arrested the guy and you're never

1528
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,520
going to believe this he had a Gucci

1529
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,500
tote bag with his threat actor handle

1530
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,480
stenciled in it and it just kind of

1531
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,800
matched everything so it was in the code

1532
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,599
it was on his Gucci bag he had the code

1533
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,180
on his laptop and so but this this kind

1534
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,520
of sums everything up you know you can

1535
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,900
use kits

1536
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,880
to get a lot of good information and to

1537
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,780
go after these guys

1538
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,119
thanks everybody we appreciate it

1539
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,780
thank you
