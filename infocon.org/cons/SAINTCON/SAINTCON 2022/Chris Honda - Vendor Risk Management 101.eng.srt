1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
going to talk about kind of how we got

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to where we are with vrm today a little

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,740
bit of the origins and what has kind of

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,440
pushed change in the last decade or so

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,360
we're going to talk about what VR might

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,980
look in your organization currently

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,839
because there's almost definitely some

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,260
form whether it's called vrm or not that

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,300
that that's going to be highly dependent

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,980
but there's there's something going on

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,840
what just kind of want to point out what

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,300
may be going on

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,599
in your company right now

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,399
then we're going to kind of take a peek

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,500
at like who cares right vendorous

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,940
management isn't something that most

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,380
people care about I know I didn't think

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,880
about it until I started working for

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,379
wistic now I I see from of course from

20
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,300
an Insider's perspective but I see a lot

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,420
of value in it in terms of how it plays

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,820
into overall information security

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
we're going to talk about the key core

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,800
two fundamental pieces of vendor risk

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,579
management which is the difference

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,699
between here and residual risk and how

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,500
that impacts your organization how you

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,960
can use that to I guess Drive change

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,659
Drive decision making and then we're

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,820
going to go over a high level this is if

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,640
I had no tools if I had no way to

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,860
approach if I had very limited knowledge

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,659
of what needed to happen this is kind of

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,060
how I would recommend on an unofficial

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,159
basis how to get started with the vrm

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,060
program

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,400
so a few things to keep in mind this is

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,159
me talking I'm not here inherently as

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
your representative of wistic I'm not

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,580
here to preach the gospel of this is how

41
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,159
vrm should be done or must be done this

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,020
is simply some of my experiences some of

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,340
the discussions that I've had with other

44
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,740
people throughout the industry and uh

45
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,140
please take as take everything I say

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,759
with a grain of salt

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,060
um I'm generally not a speaker in front

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,100
of people I don't know so

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,680
please take that as you will

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm also hoping to be more descriptive

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,340
in terms of hey this is what

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,100
has generally worked but you might find

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,360
a good variation that works better for

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,399
your organization as opposed to hey this

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,259
is right this is not the gospel of this

56
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,719
is not the way of how vrm is supposed to

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,740
be done

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,080
and as always if there's anything that

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
you're unsure of please don't claim me

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
as giving you advice because I'm

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,180
definitely not a lawyer I'm not about

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,440
that life

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,040
um

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,340
like our last keynote said it's great to

65
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,560
have lawyers I'm not one so if you have

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,060
questions about how to go about this or

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,500
if something's kosher or not for your

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,680
organization please ask them not me

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,300
um you can ask me just don't take that

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,160
as proper advice

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,860
so when we're thinking about vrm right

72
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,459
there's been some form of this and

73
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,980
in in business for a long long time I

74
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,560
mean longer than longer than it's been

75
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
in its current form for sure

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,900
uh you might also know it by third party

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,540
risk management

78
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,160
procurement I mean there's there's all

79
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,180
sorts of different ways that you could

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,280
look at it and vendorous management kind

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,379
of falls into multiple different areas

82
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,180
right we're essentially wanting to know

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,400
what is in our company's ecosystem

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,959
what's in our environment what are they

85
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,819
doing how are they doing it how much

86
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,800
asking those kinds of questions and

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,300
seeing how that's going to impact then

88
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,640
how you operate

89
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,459
uh in in the last decade right I mean

90
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,019
this part a big part of why we're all

91
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,580
here is because we want to keep our

92
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,099
organization safe and the trend over

93
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,200
recent decades especially since The

94
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,599
Internet's been a bigger thing is that

95
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,300
there's a lot more easy access to data

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,120
and things that we don't generally want

97
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
people to just have unfettered access to

98
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,739
so when you think of issues of why vrm

99
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,959
is important you think vendor related

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,300
breaches right this is the favorite the

101
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,040
favorite I I can't even say buzzword but

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,780
this is the

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,760
sorry my ears are weird it's just not

104
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,080
wanting to stay

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
um when we're thinking about how our

106
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
supply chain right this could be our our

107
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
actual physical supply chain our digital

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,080
supply chain and how this impacts our

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,580
business

110
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,280
um we're thinking about how

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,940
in multiple steps of this process a

112
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,980
vendor not nearly our organization can

113
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,200
impact how we deliver the quality of

114
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,060
what we deliver and then the trust that

115
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,980
our customers have in us right

116
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,360
so when you're thinking about the bad

117
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,159
guys the hackers the the folks behind

118
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
with the hoodies and the masks on behind

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
the computer

120
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,560
some of the bigger names that have

121
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,839
happened in recent history are I'm not

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,940
sure if I could use logos so I kind of

123
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,800
pick your generic ones like your

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
favorite hardware store this has been a

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
big deal I I I'm a recently new

126
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,960
homeowner so I don't love knowing that

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
people can get access to my card

128
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,560
information just because I made a

129
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,840
payment at like I said my uh your

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,660
favorite hardware store my wife's

131
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,880
favorite store it looks a little bit

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,340
like that logo on the right right

133
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,080
there's that that was a big issue

134
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
several years ago

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
uh pretty much every social media outlet

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,040
has had some sort of incident many a few

137
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,919
of them have had many uh unfortunately

138
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,740
and then also right because data is

139
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,380
money and sometimes money is money also

140
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,520
uh there's also been lots of incidents

141
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,020
breaches data leaks with financial

142
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,660
institutions fintech right I mean

143
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
everything ends up coming down to money

144
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,780
especially when you're on on the other

145
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,040
side of the keyboard and you're just

146
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,419
looking to

147
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,120
make a make a living whether you're just

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
looking to burn something down right

149
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,500
that's everything ends up relating to

150
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,919
money in some capacity

151
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,419
if it's into your organization well

152
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,639
chances are your organization exists to

153
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,600
make money

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
um I I know that there's a lot of

155
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,979
government organizations and schools

156
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,300
which I guess technically is a

157
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,979
government organization right you're

158
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,539
still delivering a service right there's

159
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,419
still some exchange of good of value of

160
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,479
time and effort in exchange for money at

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,240
some point right and looking at the

162
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,699
inside of Any Given organization

163
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,639
there's

164
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,860
thank you for your patience

165
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,780
um at any given point there's going to

166
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,180
be tools Services contractors people

167
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,979
that are giving services to your

168
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,380
organization so you can in turn you can

169
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,300
in turn turn around and give something

170
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,580
to your customers to your bra to your

171
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,380
buyers

172
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,680
and in my perspective that makes vrm an

173
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
issue for everybody in some capacity

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,380
right

175
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120
um and and a big part of this is an

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,860
awareness deal kind of like we heard in

177
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,259
one of the Keynotes today right you

178
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,699
can't protect something that you don't

179
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,960
know about you can't protect something

180
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,940
if you don't know how to protect it so

181
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,160
having a base level awareness of why

182
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,860
theorem as important is essential I

183
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,660
would argue for everyone in your

184
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
organization in your company

185
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,220
uh like I mentioned before businesses

186
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,080
exist for the purpose of making money

187
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,060
right there's there's other

188
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,400
goals that can be with her right driving

189
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,259
positive change

190
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,120
um improving livelihood improving

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
quality of life but in essence right no

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,860
no one's going to really spend all their

193
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,620
all their time effort and and coordinate

194
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,139
the time and effort of other people

195
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,639
solely for that right there's got to be

196
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,340
some exchange of value so when you think

197
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,720
about it when you get down to vendors

198
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
are just organizations they sell Goods

199
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,600
services expertise for money

200
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,660
so if you're thinking Costco I'd blow

201
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,560
way way way too much money there on a

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
unfortunately more than a weekly basis

203
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,680
right you're going to shop for your

204
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,479
groceries that's that that's a vendor

205
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
everything is a vendor is is the blanket

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,639
term I like to stay away from um blanket

207
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,340
always Nevers but hey this that's it

208
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,500
just kind of fits in this case uh if you

209
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
sell software with stick a software many

210
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,740
of your companies also I know our

211
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,000
software

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
um you're a vendor you're a software

213
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
vendor if you fix toilets you pull um

214
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,020
you pull piping or cables for uh for

215
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
electrical work you're also a vendor

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
right you're selling your service and

217
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,000
sometimes the goods if you're an

218
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,440
underwater basket weaving teacher I

219
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,639
thought this was a really cool thing

220
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,960
except I'm not good at staying

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,539
underwater and I'm a terrible Weaver you

222
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,860
are still a vendor because you're

223
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,599
selling expertise same thing if you're a

224
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,919
consultant right it could be something

225
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,979
from anything from corporate strategy to

226
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,259
Checker strategy this is a fun one I was

227
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,639
playing with I was playing checkers with

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,900
my daughter and she said oh I want to

229
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,460
learn to be better like well let's try

230
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,199
and work that into the presentation I

231
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,580
know it didn't really land that well but

232
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,280
hey we'll get over it

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,080
um so everyone is a vendor right and

234
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,879
everyone is a vendor because they want

235
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,699
to make money and how that ties in is

236
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,919
pretty much directly related to how your

237
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,680
organization operates and how we manage

238
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,419
that and how that impacts your

239
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,059
organization is really what comes down

240
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,799
to who is responsible and who's

241
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,360
accountable which are generally

242
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,399
different things for managing vendor

243
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,860
risk in your organization

244
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,380
so everything comes down to risk in this

245
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,279
case right we we cannot operate without

246
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
having some level of risk there's

247
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,420
there's a risk to getting out of bed in

248
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,160
in the morning I got out of bed this

249
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
morning and I tripped that was

250
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,360
embarrassing but I mean it kind of

251
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
illustrates the point right just just by

252
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,560
being alive there's risk same thing with

253
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,480
driving same thing with going to your

254
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,860
favorite restaurant there's risks

255
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,839
Associated and depending on how you

256
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,399
think about it if you're really paranoid

257
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,200
like me you're thinking about risk all

258
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,459
the time even if it's not in a

259
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,620
professional capacity so what we think

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,940
about as Information Security

261
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,279
Professionals for event from a vendor

262
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,220
risk perspective is how is this

263
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,440
particular service provider this

264
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,500
particular vendor going to impact

265
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,980
my organization my my ability to deliver

266
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,519
whatever I'm selling uh and then and

267
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,640
being able to properly

268
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,899
control that maintain that without

269
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,300
causing disruption to that service right

270
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,720
there's there's that kind of vibe in our

271
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,519
industry where security where the

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,839
security team or the people that you go

273
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,519
to when you want to hear no

274
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,080
um I make that joke even though I say

275
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
yes a lot to stuff but I mean it's it

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
seems to be pretty common if you say no

277
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,339
and there's no explanation why then

278
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,200
there's a lot of distrust centers coming

279
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,180
from there and and I would argue that

280
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,399
our goal is kind of the opposite our

281
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,899
goal as Information Security

282
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,959
Professionals is to properly manage the

283
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,360
risk associated with delivering our

284
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,459
value as professionals so that our

285
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,560
overall company can do what they do make

286
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,839
money so we can all get paid and put

287
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,120
food on the table

288
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,440
when we're thinking about risk right

289
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,080
this is this this is high level

290
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,420
there's

291
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,860
there's a tolerance there's an appetite

292
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,680
in terms of how much risk that an

293
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
organization or an individual if you

294
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,500
want to think about it that way first is

295
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,360
willing to take on

296
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,580
um if you like skydiving right there's a

297
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,200
lot of risks that go with that if that's

298
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,580
not something within your appetite

299
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,899
you're not comfortable with those

300
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,579
particular risks being actualized you

301
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,560
probably shouldn't do that and it's kind

302
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
of similar with information security in

303
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
our organizations right generally the

304
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
board of directors sometimes the c-suite

305
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,760
they'll say hey this is what we want you

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
to do this is what we are comfortable

307
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,540
with we are not comfortable with losing

308
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,800
more than

309
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,420
five hundred thousand dollars or five

310
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,440
million dollars I don't know how big

311
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,519
your company is how big your

312
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,200
organization is right but there's going

313
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,579
to be some level of appetite worth where

314
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,740
we're fine saying hey it's okay if this

315
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,839
happens because we have resources

316
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,660
reputation we have guardrails in place

317
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,420
that if this happens where we can

318
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,279
tolerate it we can handle this

319
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,839
all right and that's going to be unique

320
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,640
to each individual organization so

321
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,380
that's something that if if you as the

322
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,000
information security team don't set it

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
probably isn't that's something you want

324
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,880
to get in touch with your Senior

325
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Management about or your board of

326
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,700
directors because ultimately they're the

327
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,140
ones accountable right we talked about

328
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,640
the difference between accountability

329
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,560
and responsibility they're accountable

330
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,940
for it so they should be the ones giving

331
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,620
the high level Direction you make that

332
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,560
plan happen

333
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,320
risk is more than money I mean we I I've

334
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,079
mentioned the money a lot in this up up

335
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,899
to this point and and there's I mean

336
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,579
it's for good reason right if we don't

337
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,800
do our job we don't get paid and I'd

338
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,140
like being employed and having money

339
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,360
um but you have to also kind of consider

340
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
the different factors that go into maybe

341
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,820
that overall Financial aspect right so

342
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,980
there can be negative impact to your

343
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,839
brand to your reputation there's legal

344
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,640
action that just slows you down adds

345
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
extra bureaucracy and worth that you

346
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,060
just really don't want to generally deal

347
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,040
with so you have to consider this when

348
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,019
you're looking at your overall vendor

349
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,640
risk level

350
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,700
and and as a heads up I mean we'll we'll

351
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,320
dive into different ways to mitigate

352
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,079
risk or to rather manage risk to to talk

353
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,459
about risk

354
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,800
um not all risk is going to be worth

355
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,680
uh reducing right there's you you can

356
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,959
pull some levers to say hey this is how

357
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,420
much the risk will currently pose to us

358
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,320
sometimes the amount of effort time

359
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,959
person hours dollars that you have to

360
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,399
throw at a problem sometimes just isn't

361
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,339
worth it uh in terms of if if you were

362
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,620
to take that course of action so I mean

363
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,700
just just keep that in the back your

364
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,959
mind just because a risk is there

365
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,100
doesn't mean you have to deal with it

366
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,380
you can step away from it one completely

367
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,060
right I mean you can't step away from

368
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,200
all risk because then you might as well

369
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
just close your computers take them off

370
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,100
the internet shut down business because

371
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,800
that's just the way it we can't deliver

372
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,260
without having some sort of risk in the

373
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,180
game

374
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,380
and if we're thinking about high level

375
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,019
right qualitatively I mean I know you

376
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,959
can quantify this using real numbers but

377
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,279
in general when we're looking at risk

378
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,160
it's How likely is something to happen

379
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,139
multiplied against how bad is this going

380
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,700
to hurt right if my five-year-old

381
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,019
daughter throws her favorite toy I mean

382
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,360
what she does on a regular basis it's

383
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
gonna hurt but she misses a lot she's

384
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
five and she gets my jeans she's a very

385
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,540
bad thrower so

386
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,300
um as she gets bigger and older and

387
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,160
hopefully more athletic than I ever was

388
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,560
she's going to be capable of throwing

389
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,100
bigger things more accurately

390
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,240
meaning that it's a higher chance that

391
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
she's actually going to hit me with her

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,540
toy and it's going to hurt more so

393
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,639
that's kind of the visual that I that I

394
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,920
think about

395
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,420
um of course out of the professional

396
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,700
context there's four different ways

397
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,579
generally speaking that we that we treat

398
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,560
risk that we manage risk right we can

399
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,540
accept risk right using the analogy of

400
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,519
my kid likes throwing toys at me I can

401
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,079
just accept that's going to happen and I

402
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,940
frequently do

403
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,740
um it's it's just her favorite thing and

404
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm working on that so I can I can

405
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,620
accept that it's going to happen I'll

406
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,820
let it happen

407
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,560
I could transfer the risk which in this

408
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,880
case is not very viable because that

409
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
means I have to carry a door or

410
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,639
something like that or I have to use my

411
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,800
wife as a human shield which she's got

412
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,839
better reflexes than me so maybe that's

413
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
a viable solution

414
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,260
um

415
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,660
yeah I mean the toys aren't that hard

416
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,100
but I don't like things being thrown at

417
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,899
me I'm a really bad catch

418
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:37,860
um

419
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,139
you can avoid the risk right by stepping

420
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,600
back right like I mentioned if it's just

421
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,199
too expensive to fix this risk then you

422
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,699
just step away say hey it's not worth

423
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,500
integrating this vendor this this

424
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,360
happens from time to time we had it we

425
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,459
our marketing team wanted to

426
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,920
excuse me our marketing team wanted to

427
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,899
use uh engage with a new partner but we

428
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,139
don't have certain mechanisms certain

429
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,940
mechanisms in place to help us with the

430
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,680
gdpr requirements because we are

431
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,540
expanding our operations outside of the

432
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,240
states and I was like look guys this is

433
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
just going to cost us way too much to do

434
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
and if we do it with all the proper

435
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,860
guide rails in place then we're going to

436
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,540
have gdpr issues that's definitely not

437
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,160
something that we want to do

438
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,639
or the what the factor that we look at

439
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,500
most generally as as Security

440
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,060
Professionals is the reduction or the

441
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,380
mitigation of risk right this is where

442
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,180
we do something or have our vendors do

443
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,160
something to reduce the chance or the

444
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,959
impact or both preferably of something

445
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,519
bad happening

446
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,199
so when we're looking at identifying and

447
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,300
tracking risk you want to know what you

448
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,920
have what different data types you have

449
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,500
names special categories right we're

450
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,260
thinking voting history

451
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,779
um sexual identity criminal history

452
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,339
right these these are things that some

453
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,079
organizations track and you have to know

454
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,820
what you have or else you can't properly

455
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,860
Safeguard it protect it keep it where

456
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,740
it's supposed to be you have to classify

457
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,500
that data right not not all data is made

458
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,839
equal so if you have a name by itself

459
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,639
that is not the same as having a name a

460
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
date of birth a social security number a

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,779
password number because that bundle of

462
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,660
data right there is much more

463
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,300
destructive potentially if it become if

464
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,160
it falls in the wrong hands if it's used

465
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,980
for inappropriate purposes right so you

466
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,480
have to know right is is this your

467
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,820
company's crown jewels is I I don't

468
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,320
particularly love that term but I know

469
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
it's used somewhat frequently is this

470
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,339
critical is this low risk data is this

471
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,260
informational only right you can come up

472
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,760
with a schema that makes sense to your

473
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,800
to your organization but you got to know

474
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,620
hey is a game sensitive is a date of

475
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,779
birth sensitive right and a lot of

476
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:37,920
that's just going to kind of depend on

477
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,079
how on how you run things

478
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,639
and you're also going to need an

479
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,160
inventory of vendors not just hey their

480
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,480
names but you you want as much

481
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,100
information on them as possible because

482
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,079
things are going to happen right

483
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,959
relationships are going to change

484
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,100
processing purpose is going to change

485
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,440
there's going to be a fluctuation in

486
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
volume and you want to be aware that

487
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,860
these things know exactly where to look

488
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,139
so you can keep your team updated you

489
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,100
can keep the teams that you support

490
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,439
updated and your customers as well

491
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,619
so for example right I won't go over

492
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,280
that I I I I timed this and I went over

493
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,599
a little bit so I'm not going to do that

494
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,020
one uh and looking back at the core

495
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,880
tenets of essentially what vendoris

496
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,140
comes down to right we're looking at the

497
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,119
difference between inherent risk and

498
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,859
residual risk

499
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,260
and essentially how we look at that is

500
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,679
inherent risk is hey vendor a what do

501
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,179
you have

502
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,100
if you have high-risk data you are just

503
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,299
plain straight from an inherent

504
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,500
perspective you are inherently a

505
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,360
high-risk vendor if you only have low

506
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,400
risk data you are inherently a low risk

507
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,380
vendor right something can happen right

508
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,620
if if if if you have two vendors one has

509
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,780
low risk one has high risk data both are

510
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,340
breached both are compromised in some

511
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,140
way the one of the high risk data

512
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,720
regardless is going to have a higher

513
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,820
probability of impacting negatively

514
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,260
impacting your organization because

515
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,179
they're in your supply chain then we

516
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,799
think about the residual risk which is

517
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,360
kind of what is sometimes a little

518
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,179
harder to quantify or even qualify it

519
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,340
just kind of depends on on on what's

520
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,559
important to you but this is where you

521
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,440
take in all the different factors right

522
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,539
you take your analysis you take your

523
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,100
assessments and you figure out hey what

524
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
is in place to make that risk lower do

525
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,960
they have things in place to lessen the

526
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,660
impact if they were to be breached or

527
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,760
do they have things to make it less

528
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,260
likely that this is going to happen in

529
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,240
the first place even if it were to still

530
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,460
happen it'll still be painful

531
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,880
so keeping that in mind this is how I if

532
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,919
if I were thrown into a new organization

533
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,179
I didn't have any tools I didn't have

534
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,740
any budgets like hey just get something

535
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,080
stood up this is the high level of how

536
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,460
I'd approach it

537
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,539
so you want to start with a good

538
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,820
relationship right and this is with not

539
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,380
only your team although you just

540
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,280
definitely want to have that because

541
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
like I mentioned everyone in your

542
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,919
organization is going to use tools has

543
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,419
some interaction with vendors you need

544
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,340
to have that good relationship or else

545
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,480
people are going to start going around

546
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,220
you they're going to engage in what

547
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,200
sometimes I don't think it's used as

548
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,460
often they're going to engage in what's

549
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,320
called Shadow I.T where hey this

550
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,760
application isn't approved but it makes

551
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,400
my life easier so I'm going to do it you

552
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,539
also want to have a good relationship

553
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,460
with your vendors right they're the ones

554
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,679
that from from a partner's perspective

555
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,880
right someone can be giving you a

556
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,620
service but if you're pursuing a true

557
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,240
partnership to make that relationship

558
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,280
effective you want to have a good

559
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,620
person-to-person relationship with that

560
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,200
you all want a catalog right this is

561
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,340
just kind of part of the information

562
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,260
security Basics right you want to have a

563
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,320
good asset inventory a good catalog or a

564
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,840
way to track who has what and how much

565
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,400
what's it used for

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
ETC you you you just have to know these

567
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,140
things because if one of my vendors if

568
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,940
one of my core vendors is breached and

569
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,460
10 of my other vendors use that vendor I

570
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,539
don't know what's and I don't know

571
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,100
what's there that becomes an issue

572
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,480
because now I got a bunch of customer

573
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,760
data that's floating around floating out

574
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,460
there being potentially abused and I

575
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,539
don't know what to tell my customers

576
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,160
that's not a situation that we want to

577
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,500
be in so having catalog having an

578
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,539
inventory of who has what and for what

579
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,820
purpose is going to be critical

580
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,100
you want to go through an assessment an

581
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,440
analysis I mean the words you want to

582
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,020
use is is its own thing right but you

583
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,940
pretty much want to check and confirm

584
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,160
that your vendors have something in

585
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,020
place right that could be through

586
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,640
questionnaires I could be through other

587
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
independent studies or or assessments

588
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,539
but we'll we'll kind of touch on that

589
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,100
but you need to have something you need

590
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,419
to have something more than hey my gut

591
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,860
says that they're cool I've seen that

592
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,480
happen before it doesn't generally end

593
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,520
up end up well

594
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,140
you're also going to want to check in

595
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,580
regularly with your vendors right

596
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,559
reassess them from time to time doesn't

597
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,000
have to be every year that's generally

598
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,380
the recommendation but you don't have to

599
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,179
do that just make sure that you're

600
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,860
checking in sometimes

601
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,880
oh

602
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,980
all right check in make sure that you

603
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,840
have good relationships with people I

604
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,120
think that security is a people I think

605
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,500
information security is a people

606
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,320
industry right and and it kind of rubs

607
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,400
me the wrong way when I hear that people

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,500
are our weakest are the weakest link I

609
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,480
get what they say but it still rubs me

610
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,100
the wrong way right people are the

611
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,160
reason that we do stuff right we provide

612
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,559
value via our company via our

613
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,660
organization because we want money to

614
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,640
take care of our our people our friends

615
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,620
our family and everyone else in the

616
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,820
world is out there just to do the same

617
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,980
right so if we kind of just are good

618
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,140
folks

619
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,039
we don't have to be best friends or

620
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,960
anything but if if we are courteous and

621
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,760
we're respectful and we are looking out

622
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
for each other looking to help that

623
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
makes all the difference I mean some of

624
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,740
the best vendor relationships we have is

625
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,179
where hey we treat each other like

626
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,039
people not as a contract not as a dollar

627
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,380
figure because I've seen it go both ways

628
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,720
and it never feels good to be on that

629
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,940
end of you're just a dollar figure

630
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,640
and and I mean golden rule states right

631
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,140
you want you want to be good to you you

632
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,580
want to treat others the way that you

633
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,419
want to

634
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,299
create that inventory have that catalog

635
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,220
have the have the asset management

636
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,760
inventory right know what each vendor is

637
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
going to do right Microsoft does more

638
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,260
than just office so you want to know are

639
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,360
we using Azure for our infrastructure

640
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,940
are we using um Power bi for our

641
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,039
analytics right you want to you want to

642
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
know exactly what each of these vendors

643
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,760
that you're using is going to do for you

644
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,419
so you know what data they have which I

645
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,980
guess is down one more bullet than I

646
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,260
thought it was going to be and leaning

647
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,419
on the on leaning heavier on the person

648
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,860
part right you also want to know who to

649
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,360
talk to right if you have billing

650
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,340
questions if you if you need to update

651
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,260
your licenses which we had to do for one

652
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,340
of our vendors and I didn't know where

653
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,659
to go so that's

654
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,120
it was a hassle knowing who to talk to

655
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,299
for specific questions is really is is

656
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,460
really critical and and it saves you a

657
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,840
ton of time a ton of frustration and

658
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,480
nowhere to turn right and and again you

659
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,460
want to know what data they have what

660
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,440
they're doing for you and how much

661
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,240
you also want to know in this day and

662
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,980
age of Integrations being everything I

663
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,900
know it's super convenient but you got

664
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,159
to track that right are they pullings

665
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,080
from Salesforce which has freaking

666
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
everything right Salesforce has

667
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
everything that is the lifeblood of a

668
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
lot of organizations so knowing what

669
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,840
data they have what their organ what

670
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,520
they're ingrained into and what they're

671
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
able to do with that is something you

672
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,460
want to be really cognizant about

673
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,620
because if if you don't say hey we don't

674
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,480
want you to do this they very well might

675
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,799
be doing that and that's something you

676
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,179
want to keep a close tab on keep the

677
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,480
pulse on that and probably the biggest

678
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,240
piece of this is you want proof like I

679
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,159
said you don't want to just say hey I

680
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,780
did a review I feel comfortable with

681
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,580
them okay prove it now you're being

682
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,280
audited by someone by any of your

683
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,500
customers it could be it could be an ISO

684
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,940
it could be sock too it could be any of

685
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,260
these different areas you want to be

686
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,940
able to demonstrate yes I did something

687
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,120
not just my gut felt good about it

688
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,000
uh so I I don't know if I promise but

689
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,740
this isn't a sales pitch for wistic this

690
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,080
is just how I happen to use our own tool

691
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,780
to help us with vent with vrm

692
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,000
um I I'm tracking our data right this

693
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,460
this is these are some of the key areas

694
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,760
of which I'm managing data for each of

695
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,320
our vendors so I know exactly where to

696
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,940
turn to if I have an issue with x y and

697
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,600
z

698
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,820
all right so down here I know exactly

699
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,940
what data types are they that this

700
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
particular vendor has I know who in our

701
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,679
company is responsible for this who so

702
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,240
if I have issues internally with this

703
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,919
who do I talk to who do I direct people

704
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:05,880
to

705
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,740
so you want to have the grant as

706
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,419
granular information as possible right

707
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,980
so they're inherent risk they have

708
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
medium data they have medium risk data

709
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,760
so inherently they are a medium risk

710
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,919
vendor but we have other place we have

711
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,780
other mechanisms in place that I've

712
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,039
confirmed that other people have

713
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,500
confirmed and demonstrated so and and

714
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,080
our feeling they are now a low risk

715
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,940
vendor because I know if this were to

716
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,179
happen then this particular control on

717
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,159
their side would reduce the chance of

718
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,659
this happening or reduce the impact it

719
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,400
wouldn't hurt us nearly as much

720
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,740
all right and I have a history so if

721
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,419
someone says hey tell me did you really

722
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,240
assess vendor XYZ like yes I did it on

723
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,799
these days these are my comments this is

724
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,020
what I found these are the artifacts and

725
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,480
I can demonstrate we know exactly what's

726
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,600
going on so if and on on the flip side

727
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,520
if you've entered a light about

728
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,960
something right this is not something

729
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,340
that you run into very often but you

730
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,559
always want to cover your back end if

731
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,960
your vendor was untruthful or less than

732
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,760
truthful about something you can say oh

733
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,340
this this is what we knew so we made

734
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,740
choices and decisions based on the

735
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,539
information that we had so that kind of

736
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,740
helps you well on the liability side

737
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,539
again not lawyer not telling you that

738
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,299
this is this will keep you safe but this

739
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,220
is something that has kind of helped

740
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,900
support us over the years

741
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,520
you want to assess each vendor's

742
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,919
security posture there's lots of

743
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,240
different acronyms that I'm just going

744
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,340
to kind of throw up many of you are

745
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,900
familiar with pretty much all of these

746
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,480
there's been a good shift I think one

747
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,460
thing I will say is that there's been a

748
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,140
good shift away from each company having

749
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,700
their own spreadsheet Custom Design

750
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,860
questionnaire that takes 10 days to fill

751
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,059
out and then you have three months of

752
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,679
back and forth right there's been a

753
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,120
shift away from that it's not totally

754
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,860
gone because I still deal with it I'll

755
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,220
tell you it still exists but there's

756
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,659
resources out there if you know you have

757
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,520
a lot of SAS customers look at the cake

758
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,440
send them that because everyone is going

759
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,820
to have the same set of questions that

760
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,500
answers a lot of the critical questions

761
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,000
that you're looking at like

762
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,159
where is your data hosted is it

763
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,620
encrypted how is it encrypted and that

764
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,539
way you don't have to go through a bunch

765
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,679
of different stuff you can fill it out

766
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,080
once so when your customers ask you that

767
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,059
you as a vendor can just say here's my

768
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,919
cake or here's my sock too here's my

769
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,299
information security policy my

770
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:15,960
acceptable use sock to ISO right if you

771
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,279
have these things ready then use a

772
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,380
vendor save a lot of time but these are

773
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,140
also some assets some options that you

774
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,179
might not have known as available to you

775
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,820
to get a good pulse on how your vendors

776
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,460
are taking care of your data

777
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,039
and maintain the relationship right just

778
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,100
just be good folks I mean I I feel like

779
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,539
in the industry most folks are are

780
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,520
really really good but I I think that

781
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,440
there's also definitely very much room

782
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,620
and where we can look to support uplift

783
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,820
help

784
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,919
the industry and the community as a

785
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,779
whole right if if you lift the water

786
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,460
level then all the boats are going to go

787
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,360
up and that's what we want

788
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,640
metaphorically I guess right we want

789
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,740
everyone to we want everyone to have a

790
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,000
better experience to have a better

791
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,220
security posture to have

792
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,559
um to make their lives easier and by

793
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,720
supporting other supporting other

794
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,279
information security teams one maybe

795
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,260
they don't know what's going on or

796
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,760
they're not as familiar with the terms

797
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,500
that you're using hold their hand walk

798
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,700
them through that that educational

799
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,640
payback many times and that'll help

800
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,380
strengthen your relationship I feel at

801
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,600
least I know it has for me so

802
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,740
um

803
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,100
follow up on commitments conduct

804
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,000
reassessments sometimes right doesn't

805
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
have to be annual I put that in here

806
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
that's a best practice don't really love

807
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,039
that term

808
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,020
but in in this case right just just make

809
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,279
sure you're checking in every once in a

810
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,600
while see if there's been any material

811
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
changes is how a lot of lawyers say it

812
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,460
right if there's material change just

813
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,679
check and see hey what's changed

814
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,080
um don't be a jerk about it I mean I I

815
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,120
get questionnaires not as much as I used

816
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
to thank goodness but if someone's

817
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
throwing a bunch of thousand plus

818
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,799
question questionnaires that yeah

819
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,659
um you want the time and the flexibility

820
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,100
to handle that you can give that same

821
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,720
Grace to your vendors

822
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,559
and if if if if you can ask what do you

823
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,000
need from us how can we help you how can

824
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,039
we support your security program how can

825
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,860
