1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
you gonna do and such just remind
everybody that sank on as a production

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,800
of the Utah st. organization did you
haven't had an opportunity while you

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,080
were here to learn more about US aid
organization that's sad but at the same

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,038
time it's a group of network security
professionals throughout the state of

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
Utah and beyond now there's members from
all over the place where we share a lot

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,179
of information we want to make you aware
of this organization it's free to join

7
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,230
the organization and contribute to be
part of its the glitches that we had in

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,669
some other of the sign up and betting
systems have been fixed so if you have

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,829
previously tried and haven't heard
anything back those issues are fixed

10
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,210
point of GV doing a lot of weddings over
the next couple of days for sure and so

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,300
will you hear back from us one way or
another and then I'm not going to bore

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,309
you with the details on how it all works
because we talked about it during the

13
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:04,080
opener suffice it to say it with a buddy
that's part of me doesn't Organization

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,679
help you out

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,360
and I'm getting himself and he did
remind me this earlier but if you've

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
already signed up you don't need to sign
up again we have all that information

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,199
the vetting process email system and
other things that we were there we use

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,030
wasn't working properly

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,330
had taken down two times against you
between Amazon and our server so next

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,330
thing appropriately so we want to thank
our sponsors this year

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,710
ok that reason why you have a really
cool bags around your neck is because of

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,250
the sponsors like this

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,670
Cache Valley Electric is active network
management comp unit but nine Aruba

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,170
ported checkpoints Adobe CenturyLink
balcom Bluehost and a few others that

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,470
have donated either a lot of time like
the Utah Education Network we can't run

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,070
a conference with five UN employees
being on the committee without the union

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,540
organisation don't get a lot of our time
to prepare for this conference but it's

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,880
these vendors it's these people that
make it to do things like the Badgers

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,500
that allows us to buy the audio-visual
equipment this year that we needed to

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,160
make sure that nobody here's a sweetie
Mike ever again

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:37,070
we appreciate their involvement of some
time to visit them out there in the

32
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,730
vendor Expo will only let them come for
two days some of my be here today still

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,320
only let them set up their wares and
talk to you guys for two of the days

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,739
officially so that you don't get
overwhelmed with it but at the same time

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,080
it compresses it down so you can go
visit them you have two days to do it

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,730
and it doesn't interfere too much with
the conference because we like to be

37
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,750
vendor-neutral as much as possible here
with a lot of the products you won't see

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,410
many product recommendations come from
any of the lease the space the

39
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:17,210
committee's stocks the next people that
need thank you and a big round of

40
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:26,660
applause for these folks

41
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,710
not only donated the venue that we've
used for the last number of years but

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,020
this year as well as ellison the room

43
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,840
good it is not that I can see this
outlook and just say that he's got a lot

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,760
of employees that a lot of nights and
weekends but probably a few hours during

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,440
the day as well helping make this
conference possible the badge ranging

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,380
networks of other things these guys have
done an incredible job for us and it's

47
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,310
kind of sad that we're probably not
going to be here next year to continue

48
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,590
to to take a full benefit of weaver
takes university's hospitality but will

49
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,500
most certainly continue to use their
employer resources right and then I want

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,970
to thank you the attendees for coming
for spending your time a little bit of

51
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,410
your money to come here to learn
something new to experience something

52
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,780
new and such because truly what makes
income possible what makes it important

53
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,780
really gives us the drive to continue to
do something that is becoming big

54
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,460
unwieldy and requires more time than it
used to

55
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,120
so the next thing is really quickly a
plug one more time for the survey so

56
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,449
this is how we continue to make sank on
as cool as it is we pick your feedback

57
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,639
for positive and the negative and we do
our very best to make sure that anything

58
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,050
you guys so telling us it's considered
as we do planning for the following year

59
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:12,510
we learn things along the way we have
learned this year that 600 people up to

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,300
the conference and everybody comes on
that first day of the second at nine

61
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,610
o'clock in the morning everybody sitting
down there the parking lot still trying

62
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,639
to get a shuttle over to the conference
and the first three talks of the day are

63
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,199
pretty empty we've learned a lot of
other things along the way that we take

64
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,810
back what we want to make sure we're
getting your input so please take the

65
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:42,820
time to the love that survey I would sit
as prizes involved and it's raining over

66
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,688
here so it's not ringing sorry this is
the Twitter buzz going on

67
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:57,319
that's right actually let me stop there
just caused aids and up per second

68
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,919
this guy must be on Twitter 24 hours a
day because within seconds of sync on

69
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:12,058
twenty something he's favored it and
then retweeted it like those of you that

70
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:15,549
have access to those types of social
media things we'd love to get the word

71
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:18,679
out about the conference or one of the
other reasons why we think that it's

72
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,399
growing there's a couple of questions in
the survey so we can validate some of

73
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,360
those resolves once again I want to
thank the AV guys they've done an

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:42,440
incredible job this year making this
work

75
00:06:42,440 --> 00:07:02,550
do it this year there were very few that
we didn't represent presentations as

76
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,960
time goes on we're gonna be a little bit
more selective we've got some great

77
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,989
speakers we've got some excellent
speakers in the event that you were

78
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,610
choosing whether to get talks going on

79
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,720
talks going on and I can only be in one
place the time we did our best this year

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:29,360
to talk and I think that we did it with
a few minor exceptions with audio issues

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,910
and some other things and so within a
couple of weeks to give you a deadline

82
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,710
we're gonna go through gonna post
produce all of those and make sure that

83
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,609
they have leapt out I'm sure there
weren't very many bad words like I said

84
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,729
damn a couple of times in mine

85
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:51,748
talk them out but will also make sure
that you know all of the leaders on both

86
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:55,719
ends and stuff them and make them public

87
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:01,770
it'll be the first person to have all of
the talks out there for you to watch so

88
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,198
you don't miss a darn thing so that drew
right there said that given that no

89
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,860
troops they work together to make this
happen and it was quite the themes of

90
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:21,480
class

91
00:08:21,480 --> 00:09:12,220
talk about $1,000 and that's what's
coming next year so we moved ahead but

92
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:22,070
successful and we're awarding the prize
to the group that got through it the

93
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,980
best and so would the 2nd L

94
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:47,920
you know who you are come up because
they want may come up to the room at the

95
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,889
registration table gonna take a look at
them you didn't say it im gonna explain

96
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:00,149
real quick how it works you would go to
the challenges of physical security to

97
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,970
defeat motion sensors to take you a few
doors and all kinds of other things and

98
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,070
alternately successful teams ended up
with the bags tamper-proof bag that had

99
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:20,029
a USB stick in it than just a password
hash but they had to crack to prove that

100
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,500
they were able to get into the back and
then they were instructed to bring the

101
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,839
bag back to us and handed to us as if it
hadn't been tampered and so you can see

102
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,220
top of the line

103
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,230
bags that we used these guys did an
incredible job back sixty one of them

104
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,620
and we were elected out there and nobody
was able to find out how they got into

105
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,200
it but they were able to get into the
back taxes the USB and pull the

106
00:10:48,200 --> 00:11:00,160
information often correct password did
it seriously we had to ask for seconds

107
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:12,930
late so we wanted to be really really
might roll holes and so we started with

108
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:29,589
some lanting needles were 3333 knows
that that's not gonna work right up and

109
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,200
everything

110
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,610
videos so then we switch to 26 TH plants
needles

111
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:46,180
so we're looking at different places in
the corner turns out the deep purple

112
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:58,390
blush ability to do a little bit of
nasty with actually just a tiny bit

113
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:08,949
smaller building tracking mechanism if
you try to do too much so that's that's

114
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:23,070
what we did a little jig hook it up
immediately Friday $200 to do it all 33

115
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:31,430
of us now really confused like 11 talk a
trip to the sporting good store for some

116
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:39,349
for us but what we're doing is tapping
the USB through the bag

117
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:49,620
supports USB so holding the bag training
get it just right without creating

118
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,670
sitting there trying to get the USB to
work just fine and

119
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:09,469
rig was awesome speaking of videos that
need to be edited so what we have $200

120
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:25,170
on this challenge we've got $30 rubber
duckies can separate them up here but

121
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,500
the only thing you can tell they're just
tiny little ridges on the top of this

122
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:39,480
completely inspections we didn't see it
we didn't feel it in their hands and so

123
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:51,390
on so now the runners like ok them to
prove that they got into the back of the

124
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:59,319
other group member he just keeps
whatever

125
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,470
to come up with a group named pretty
quick and so whatever came out these

126
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:10,400
guys did the second best the Glee the
same but they did a slightly different

127
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,340
strategy I won't make them explain it
but we got a little prize for them as

128
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,640
they did is it took advantage of it in
the bag when you seal it if you don't

129
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:33,080
just perfectly rigid and so they used
that thing and get out there and then

130
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:41,210
that just held it together and we get
that one but it took us awhile so they

131
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:47,760
get these really cool wireless devices
i'm happy to say that because they

132
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:59,040
donated all the stuff to us

133
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:11,630
failed miserably because you guys open
up the bags to be true we did go through

134
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,459
and we had the layman people come by the
had no idea of a construction was says

135
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,989
hey do you see any evidence of the speed
tampered with and there were some the

136
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:28,269
past the lame and muster mustard let's
just hope mustard people to $1 cecile

137
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:34,079
that's all good and so for the most part
we got back as somebody wasn't looking

138
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:42,930
the the contour the seal or whatever the
was violated nobody would have known we

139
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:59,790
got some great submissions back ahead
wanna talk about one and only two goals

140
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:08,510
never mind that there's one black thats
contest will probably expand that in the

141
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,079
next couple of years with the time and
energy we're going to put into expanding

142
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,219
the bolts and what it's going to be
tempered evident kind of challenge that

143
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,010
we're going to actually break out of its
own accord next year

144
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,500
probably have a couple of extra black
badges were gonna work next year but so

145
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:36,350
rewarding one black bad for a year to
the winner of that game so to announce

146
00:16:36,350 --> 00:17:03,010
the winner is everything else going by
Josh Galvez a master to come up

147
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:34,760
201 key prints hours available to the
game open or close during those hours

148
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:48,010
there are only two hours they fighting
and window with one key was tried

149
00:17:48,010 --> 00:18:17,210
so the key to open their 2011 the board
one of them was a black box challenge

150
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:33,830
challenge at the end but with the new
division method in this method the game

151
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:46,740
we had a lot of competition between 2nd
3rd in the top that it was a lot of

152
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,860
pride

153
00:18:47,860 --> 00:19:18,870
it was a 100 200 300 points you can this
year opened 1,000 points and then your

154
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:47,739
1501

155
00:19:47,740 --> 00:20:05,010
we had six codes committed so bored with
62 points there was one getting

156
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:19,340
challenged called challenges that were
scattered to the conference

157
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:41,689
34 policy Live On the Border Agency and
I had a lot of help

158
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:59,360
so good job

159
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:35,500
good job

160
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:54,110
background and security guy this guy
just barely he's a senior in high school

161
00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:02,850
has not graduated yet

162
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:13,199
greatest tool toy whatever there's a
land turtles if you haven't seen these

163
00:22:13,200 --> 00:23:54,980
are really cool so no room whatever you
want with that relations later

164
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:44,450
together and give Josh a round of
applause we talk a little bit about

165
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:56,700
future because the size the logistics
and other things we've decided that

166
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,530
worked

167
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:04,360
very likely I can't say they're likely
going to move the location of sync on

168
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,520
next year and right now we're looking
for that site to be probable help some

169
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,250
people believe some of the travel for
some increases the level of travel for

170
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,250
others but we feel that there's a number
of different reasons to move the

171
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,900
conference some of the ones we talked
about it just needs to move so that

172
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,730
makes it easier for certain people have
been here for a long time

173
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,540
the logistics the room that we're going
to be growing into to build an entire

174
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,840
room next year's gonna require a lot of
room and so we limited what we can do it

175
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,860
here because of prior code and some of
these other issues and such so I want to

176
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:54,010
talk about that from Provo city and if
we really can't believe we might be back

177
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,820
here next year but we were still has
agreed to let us come back if we need to

178
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:07,919
talk about first of all

179
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:17,970
we want to thank all in tears

180
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:30,720
we actually had a list that we could
pull some people have people with

181
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,280
registration and things our nice was it
on Tuesday morning to not stand in line

182
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,110
with 400 people want to your badges
right that's because of the volunteers

183
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,240
and things we did that almost nobody
stood in line at all for registration

184
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,650
they did incredible job and they were
hiding in the background doing the

185
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,510
things they need to do to make the
numbers on the smoothest so there's a

186
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,610
couple of first time ever to talk about
it for the first time ever I V word all

187
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:15,629
the way we had some major mess up with
registration of other people that need

188
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,610
to be recognized during the opener

189
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,678
but there is a lot that goes into sync
on there's registration their sponsors

190
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,420
wrangling the sponsors of helping them
how ministration things that hardware

191
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,910
there's executive track things that you
can see on the screen and these are the

192
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,070
people who made it possible and I'd like
to invite all committee members come up

193
00:27:40,070 --> 00:28:22,980
here

194
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:44,520
above and beyond the call of committee
this year we've already awarded Clint is

195
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:52,418
partnered black patch over here we would
like to also award a black best the

196
00:28:52,419 --> 00:29:17,490
designer of the hardware

197
00:29:17,490 --> 00:30:04,480

it I promise

198
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,620
we would love for you guys to respond
and perhaps be part of the committee we

199
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,260
might actually shrink the size of a
little bit next year kick some totally

200
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,200
mean that as a joke

201
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,380
everybody was exceptional this year just
to give you an idea we met every single

202
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,730
week

203
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:30,919
months we met every other week the
months prior to that and we met multiple

204
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,270
times together to talk about what we're
going to do to make some comments

205
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,900
cool and the successful as possible they
didn't credible job that but i just want

206
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,630

has been put into this opportunity again

207
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,270

208
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,560

for us the Twittersphere continues to

209
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,600
blow up on my stand up here and so
obviously Davis doing something happy

210
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,110

cables holding up nice things
accomplished them all the files will

216
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,629
have our EV group kind of sort through
them and put them where they need to go

217
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,090
that might be broken and damaged you
might just leave there and let them take

218
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:45,559
care of such but your help would be
appreciated so these guys have been here
