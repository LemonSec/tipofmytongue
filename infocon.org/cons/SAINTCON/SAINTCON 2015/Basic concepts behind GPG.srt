1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,879
boxes to get started

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:24,140
GPG under attack for months and I had
something with PGP which they're late

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,410
nineties and understand it does look
like a bunch of texts are free and

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:56,030
interested and this presentation was
basically reflects already so good about

5
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:06,760
to be an expert but I do believe that we
understand how to use GPG I think we've

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,270
got it here

7
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:14,280
expert toppings is there

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:30,049
why the history on this is early
nineties and bills every man who wrote

9
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:44,450
pgp and their street VDP privacy and
then there's GPG basically

10
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:59,319
nation PDP which is the standard we also
implement a she's just the sea and in

11
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,310
GBG which is free software
implementation

12
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:16,069
why would we use it what we're hoping to
win doesn't work so giving there's three

13
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:30,209
things Corbett vs is basically you
control your information

14
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:40,940
you sure you want to have some control
who has access to information is

15
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,140
wonderfully

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,829
restaurant is integrity

17
00:02:50,830 --> 00:03:01,850
message came in modified changed this is
your cell phones send your message and

18
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:25,000
it's so expensive you are 2013 was this
your GV GPD for water communication

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,310
for one concern polly was making sure
you're ridiculous your message will talk

20
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:40,550
about that little bit more detail the
last thing that you get from GPG is to

21
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,550
know you know they came from the person
you expected it to come from

22
00:03:45,550 --> 00:04:03,700
manipulating that you're you're talking
to a person and then then society that's

23
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:19,500
GPG gives us the benefit of GPG the
sense that if your system is compromised

24
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,860
computer there's keylogger

25
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:43,400
2012 machine jejeje no longer protect
you so if you have questions we're up

26
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,030
against some detail things please can i
dont wanna get deeper where I was soon

27
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,669
do you understand

28
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,520
and then we talk about something to
build on it so please raise your hand

29
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:12,500
and sewers months time

30
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:31,760
installed by default if you run your
desktop install the most realistic

31
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:53,320
option for most people would be some
type of normal download one man then

32
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:04,490
there's GPG for way there are tools
doesn't matter if you're on top of that

33
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:12,950
there is a command-line instructions
included with the presentation materials

34
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:24,210
exercise different specific to be able
to do to use it so you have the

35
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,419
presentation materials downloaded will
be in their talk about it don't mean I

36
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,010
don't feel that you have the command
line I don't want to stop you from being

37
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:54,090
able to use a litter on your figure out
your counsel to command line but so the

38
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:10,219
first step in getting to use DPD is your
gender age is by default this option you

39
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:18,560
can pretty much the default options if
you make your dirty little bit stronger

40
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:41,770
but but basically it boils down to is
everything but you're lucky you're here

41
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,930
a good system would still be secure so
that's your thing you want to talk about

42
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:58,440
generate keys things in JPG mistakes you
can make you should know cannot afford

43
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:06,909
to make his lose control of your private
key others too but that's basically

44
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:19,330
compromise generator keys by the default
is the use of EDSA default if you go in

45
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,659
the system

46
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:33,328
48 will be the size the next version of
GPG an option for elliptic curves it's

47
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:38,890
not there yet but if you love you
download play with it but the NextGen

48
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:51,829
option it really is what it is today
just talked about this in 2048 say is

49
00:08:51,829 --> 00:09:01,599
the default that's good enough to go
bigger than that

50
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:23,630
this is maybe one thing that you have to
be enjoying your passphrase

51
00:09:23,630 --> 00:15:23,410
security

52
00:15:23,410 --> 00:16:31,470
parties every plan on doing one this

53
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:51,130
people and to verify that they enjoy the
key belongs to that person

54
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,960
parties what they will choose you get in

55
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,800
usually the same organizations desire
will be forehead you send your

56
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:10,060
fingerprint before so they can prepare
to close much smoother begin in most

57
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:17,310
cases your bare by some one side then
you would usually government photoID

58
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:32,720
verify their pick up a few times that
should explain what fingerprint is a

59
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,330
representation

60
00:17:37,330 --> 00:18:11,178
we had just read its key I usually
that's just when you do like the full

61
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:19,779
finger finger but usually the software
you use their own legal and show you the

62
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:53,779
key idea like it

63
00:18:53,779 --> 00:19:42,080
tracks when you're trying somebody MTV
the problem is you think it's somebody

64
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,749
you basically said he released within
the system so the key point is unless

65
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:56,549
you verify their finger fingerprint
there see you probably should not sure

66
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,830
who their friends but your change
everyone else I know I'm verified this

67
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:17,439
person's I did so you should also know
that you have only generating your shirt

68
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,780
kids now the next far is

69
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:29,660
something useful to you may already got
this but for those of you not familiar

70
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:39,540
there's a metric and then there's
cryptography really the key metric he is

71
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:50,889
the same key encryption and decryption
part of the problem with symmetric key

72
00:20:50,890 --> 00:21:03,000
is shared secret the secret to share his
two sides are you got to be able to

73
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,840
share that key putting in a briefcase
handcuffed in someone's him go to the

74
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:20,120
other in the world so you can give you
got bill is shared secret sharing is the

75
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:30,000
biggest worry was symmetric and that's
where the paula jones solves basically

76
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,630
what happens is you generate your public
and private key never share your public

77
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,580
anybody even your worst enemy

78
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:49,189
Republic 83 that way it is now

79
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:56,480
and send it to you they use your public
key personnel can read something to buy

80
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,390
a public key is you

81
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:07,250
does not unlock this again

82
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:19,440
your public key encryption part there's
another feature or by you get he

83
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:28,310
approached when you have a message
seeking to control the message for you

84
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:35,290
want to assure your message came from
you and hasn't been manipulated we may

85
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,920
choose to use UPG and never trip so just
use it as a tool that allows other

86
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:49,160
people to know that the message came
from you and is manipulating your

87
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,310
private key effectively to side

88
00:22:52,310 --> 00:23:02,750
everyone else in the world can use your
your public teacher came from you but

89
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:15,290
that's the entirety and interesting so
you can go this is so cool example your

90
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:27,720
side's presentation materials if you go
in a series of steps you can take

91
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,430
there's a command line commands to do
this reason why I chose madeline is

92
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:54,690
doesn't matter what you can use a
generator is generating a replication

93
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:06,530
search of control your private key
things so basically it's recommended the

94
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,530
time

95
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:17,879
you generate your private key pair to go
and gender age education certificate is

96
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:25,880
basically saying something bad happened
I lost control don't trust the times you

97
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,820
generated and you keep that somewhere
else you store in the day or something

98
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:38,710
happens when you lose control the
ability to space the public servers and

99
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:46,700
say this key don't trust it so this is
kind of your if you the case you do the

100
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,510
one thing or not so so do you lose
control they're both private she said

101
00:24:51,510 --> 00:25:01,200
sure way to mitigate against that step
three is basically sending it to look

102
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,630
easier to share we talked about earlier
then the next shows how to get things

103
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:21,910
because your fingerprint and someone
else's money received that retrieves the

104
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:29,330
command for retrieving someone else's
how lucky then you have to make sure it

105
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,260
matches

106
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:44,460
to be public when you say you're saying
about four so you're you're basically

107
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:52,200
telling us the world I assert with this
is that person's game just because

108
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,720
you're searching just four other people
who may have to establish whether you

109
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,000
trust and that's what is basically it is
the key

110
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,570
you'll say a trust decision say yes I
trust the city and that's true shirting

111
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:22,480
to anyone else you're just saying for me
I trust this usually for case I'm at the

112
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:35,879
point they used to say

113
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:45,759
their key that you signed back to their
job floated to public sees over as maybe

114
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,889
is the

115
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:59,928
everyone to see who's just a protocol
choose export it send it to them and let

116
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:11,419
them decide if they want to just occurs
then obviously you can import one

117
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:21,869
someone else find your keys compose a
message if you're doing I reckon they

118
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:33,029
like just text file I just was why you
can do this is the committee to encrypt

119
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,469
inside your message so in this issue not
just encrypting it but you're actually

120
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:42,129
saying i'm saying that my private key
you know that we have the

121
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:52,379
confidentiality integrity and
authenticity here this is a farmer JPG

122
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,228
files the default

123
00:27:54,229 --> 00:28:06,919
give you a text to read output to be in
ASCII text readable

124
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,690
a study into text message

125
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:17,909
that's raised their children and send a
message

126
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:33,200
receive and decrypt the message message
usually if they sign you'll also be told

127
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,450
day this was signed by seller so there's
some additional parts of the exercise

128
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:50,820
but she basically said the public he
server by have a specialty server for

129
00:28:50,820 --> 00:29:00,070
the practical exercise so that this is
what I set up this one doesn't sync with

130
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:06,000
the other hand a benefit this is your
running as you're playing with something

131
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,460
new

132
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,549
the key to researchers you will never be
able to share that same day as being

133
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:21,720
shared between all the servers you can
use this as your cheese server disable

134
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,720
the scene came so you can play you can
make mistakes here to live with

135
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,630
steak and you are you'll have to live
with that for riskier time on internet

136
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:49,000
another email is usually the you get
your texts the person that doesn't

137
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,820
matter how it got in there might be a
challenge in finding someone else to

138
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:09,049
send a message to an get message from
there's this much is the German website

139
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:15,889
will be basically you can send an email
to them to the email address and I'll

140
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:23,100
send you an encrypted email back by
Richard and unless you have a bunch of

141
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:32,990
friends are interested in it you'll get
it in German

142
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:47,780
morning that I have high TV stations
available so to encourage you to work

143
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,290
the possible exercise

144
00:30:50,290 --> 00:31:08,560
message was also did you hire a magician
so you can play with this basically to

145
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:25,639
use it is expected to dispute the need
to get off the ground and actually

146
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,660
started using it there's obviously

147
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:43,010
search web interface for you type in
people's email addresses or maybe their

148
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:55,640
names but that's worth taking a look at
a really good accessible

149
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:07,750
explains alot of this is big and GvG
credible paranoid really good book

150
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:25,020
because I stay away from real
cryptography just applied cryptography

151
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:32,610
it's really good as friends they
considered one of the most authority to

152
00:32:32,610 --> 00:33:08,469
books on this list that's actually a
prepared I realized he was your you like

153
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,990
you're saying he was there you have it
looks different so she liked what are

154
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,550
the subject think you're one issue 1 is
your encryption

155
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:24,720
the prior crime rates may be the one you
say things with which she does your

156
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:35,060
deeper in you can add additional keys to
show some keys so you decide you I use

157
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:57,460
your new york city to watch I love to
poker when that comes out

158
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:06,500
GPG usually like into Linux environment
they'll be a dodgy peachy folder in your

159
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,399
home directory

160
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,790
recent files as a general rule is where
the files are like not binary so do you

161
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:23,500
do you can use GPG command-line tools
and find your already fingerprints and

162
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,580
if that gets into practical exercise
where there where you can be staged GBG

163
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:39,639
finger page then your key or you can
even put in your your your fire and then

164
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:51,589
you'll get your gear fingerprint not
always to export your keys to another

165
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:58,060
file that is a concern me how many of us
have gone more than five years without

166
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:06,910
having to reinstall bridge system to go
like I just tried to do so by myself a

167
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:13,399
new partner and then I have to say this
important part

168
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,560
thank you for everything that is that
you want to be able to shortage because

169
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:26,210
there will be times when you're when you
lose stuff so sure that the one that day

170
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,880
happens whether you plan on it worried

171
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:42,940
happens but you got the ability to
continue using the voice other questions

172
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,510
not Muslim Windows person but

173
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:59,310
presentation computer I put Windows GPG
forward to my knowledge the only one by

174
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:23,150
that she used in its just reusable but
you can come and when I do I actually

175
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:36,050
think you bad leads to an interesting
place and will bring up here there is a

176
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:48,859
video videos and I won't show it here
but if you can find it on like a while

177
00:36:48,859 --> 00:37:04,119
but it is a secret door to visit this
was in December 2012 is known in China

178
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,970
reach out to blend ringwald

179
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:20,129
only water this time so I made this
video call GPG basically this cycle of

180
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:29,250
installing GPG four-way everything
associated with that she talks about but

181
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,740
I really recommend if you're targeting
Windows user has followed mostly boring

182
00:37:34,740 --> 00:38:06,339
windows right watches such good sex
drive goes to do this video but yes yes

183
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:31,040
generate your brother Jason Kipnis just
because now you can try her out and you

184
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,750
put that on the public sees server now
people know you were involved so yes and

185
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,050
then you're having basically generate
another key parent as a pic to show

186
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:54,040
displays don't lose control the weather
doesn't look like a flash media

187
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,920
revolution certificate at my moms

188
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:19,190
the modem I say so I did my reputation
he said in a single moms that's your

189
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,410
right what you got that you'll need your
private key because you've got other

190
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,170
issues you can use it

191
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:35,329
the revolution sort of it and that's why
it's tough to choose in the product

192
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:41,650
larger size so that you have that there
is no better time to get together then

193
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:53,509
ride out to generate your deeds done
good flying weather conditions

194
00:39:53,509 --> 00:40:01,630
thing is I've seen a lot like a lot of
people start having no one to see if I

195
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:12,119
can hear she doesn't work machine sorry
work

196
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:35,369
GPG

197
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:49,209
scenario where they will like you like
saving four years or five years the

198
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:57,118
reality is whatever you want to meet
some concerns because I mean with

199
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:04,339
advances in computing Jesus strong today
it might not be strong the future so I

200
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:09,119
could see that as an argument for saying
just saw a saying an expiration date for

201
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,770
your kids

202
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:20,020
corners down the road shooting might
make this this one wide use of pasta

203
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:40,030
stage where there's no real hard and
fast rule yes I usually like to let me

204
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,720
bring up to that point

205
00:41:42,720 --> 00:42:02,879
groups playing like PGP changed so use
mine

206
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:15,880
spam here here's my turkey loaded like
an exploration myself performance today

207
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
when I generate on here

208
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:24,700
expiration date of 2018 yeah I know some
people you don't know expiration date

209
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,368
would be employed but if you saw your
looking at someones key in this expired

210
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:40,049
but it's a question you may not want to
trust his next year issued a dozen other

211
00:42:40,049 --> 00:43:05,900
auctions and bring everyone else in our
nurse who works for the Department

212
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:13,860
defense issue new ID cards this year is
she ok remember was probation

213
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:24,210
yeah basically like you're doing and you
can log into machine and you could also

214
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:34,040
use it to drift I don't know I mean
obviously the system functionality far

215
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:40,690
as I'm concerned especially when I know
the success of each other by means

216
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,960
basically

217
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:57,010
GTG using GV using the army 102 pitches
during the same thing yeah do i know its

218
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:11,230
exact look different implementations a
shirt that they're compatible that's my

219
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:17,010
goal here is to hoping you can get off
the ground like just didn't understand

220
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:27,870
so they didn't understand that God
Norway be able to use GPG PGP russia's

221
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:34,609
if I haven't me drugs aside questions

222
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,619
amor the happiest it inward do this with
you

223
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:49,359
why would recommend the presentation his
musical training key server in a Dell

224
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:58,519
may be prior report via GV degenerates
you don't find out really using his

225
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:07,229
lawyer and you're just using it to try
to learn to get comfortable with it then

226
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,650
once you feel like you've got it down in
comfortable but you can actually go for

227
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,970
real production does my purpose in this
and this is allowing you to play and

228
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:25,169
learn how to disable the ski server like
two months so you have to worry about

229
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:31,670
your TV on the internet forever so other
than that like things are going for

230
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:37,069
coming and listening and especially for
the passions rallies over things I want

231
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:41,680
by realize the goal but questions are
really always anticipate so thank you
