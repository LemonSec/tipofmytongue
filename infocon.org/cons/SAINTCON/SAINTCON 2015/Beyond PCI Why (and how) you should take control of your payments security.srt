1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,080
going and so on PC I mean everybody
who's familiar with PCI is it the same

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,620
way as a company we need to make money
not just from the Indianapolis it was

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:23,069
due yesterday so we need to get it done
early hominin love this is still a

4
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:27,299
little bit what I've learned so I've
been working in payment security payment

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,850
processing for about seventeen years now
and I've seen a lot of horrible things

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,809
happen in the world that is PCI and
other compliance and wanted to say some

7
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:41,038
of the things that people who are
actually security minded should know

8
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,710
about PCI and what they can do to
prevent the people who have been

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,670
security minded and telling them what
they need to do for PCI people are

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,170
actually really familiar with PCI
already how many people are actually

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,840
doing credit card processing

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,790
a good excellent how many people
actually don't really know PTI very well

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:14,260
did you know they have to do it but
that's a really common 12 so I'm not the

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,240
only one who gets the joke here but
really PCI is all about managing fraud

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,449
exposure what it is it is the credit
card networks to cover their butts

16
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:34,920
schools throughout the process is still
done on mainframes with global her bday

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,920
old archaic systems that just really see
here they don't use any modern practices

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,229
and they've just been pushed on for
years and years to keep adding layers

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,539
and layers of accessibility and new
features that is slow to adapt to it and

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,450
slow to work with it it's out there so
they don't want to be liable themselves

21
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,290
for any fraud that happens when someone
starts they pushed out towards the edge

22
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,630
when you get your merchant account
credit cards you need to sign on saying

23
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,960
he gonna do my best to keep you secure
tend to do that I'm going to do what's

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,790
called a compliance which is got
together and find a set of rules saying

25
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,810
your process credit cards you have to
meet this set of standards to work with

26
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,410
us if we do meet those standards you're
the one responsible for anything that

27
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,850
happens so rarely PCI compared to what I
like real compliance wish I also have to

28
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,959
do work with things like sarbanes-oxley
South 7d bills that are ones that it's

29
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,560
usually by government entities that have
large legal considerations with him BC I

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,980
just your mercy account no just a little
over what they can do with that it's

31
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,149
really dangerous why you still need to
care but it is very different

32
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,370
other types of compliance it is just too
you're dealing with so banks instead of

33
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:04,010
government if you really think there's
that much different so common situation

34
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,459
for a lot of companies is your marketing
or sales department will get some kind

35
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,739
of notice from their merchant account
that he complains do you better make

36
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:14,980
sure that

37
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,140
they won't know what they're doing they
just know that we need credit card so

38
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,279
therefore let's run around find somebody
who's going to sell us our compliance

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,860
check it out in the next year they say
yeah I guess next year maybe there's

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,900
something about that and they wait
another year until the last minute they

41
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,290
need to go find somebody else again to
pay money to see that they're secure the

42
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,510
wrong way to do aside from trying to the
point of this help you guys take a more

43
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,720
active role he prepared for this you can
see your company a lot of money and you

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,349
can also use the PCI to get deals done
in your company so one of the things

45
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,328
that really noise complaints is a lot of
companies that have been consulting with

46
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:10,180
or that I worked for directly where they
are on their complaints currently and

47
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,989
usually get thrown over to like this is
the administrator or network

48
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,548
administrator and I'll get something
like this

49
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,289
athletics skins were obviously PCI
compliant

50
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,300
that is a major major facepalm moment he
understands more in this presentation

51
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,240
but please don't have a job that I will
choke you talk about what can go wrong

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,800
if you don't have your compliance the
first things you can just leave this is

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,090
actually quite a few times where the
bank to come in and just said sorry

54
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,549
allowed to credit cards anymore how many
of you guys that would cause a problem

55
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,450
with doing business in cuba very major
concern if they walk in just a hey until

56
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,740
your compliance

57
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,980
card gets serious problems that they can
also actually giving so they can start

58
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,640
to me and say hey you know we looked at
the overall process here we saw that

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,719
there was fraud and so because we have
to take care of that brought in as soon

60
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,000
the payments that are all charged back
whatever million dollars plus using your

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,270
account or any little thing they can
make up their own times to go with what

62
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,500
they find in your system depending on
your documentation one company that got

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,849
charged $1000 per CD to code that they
saw the system

64
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:42,409
thousands of credit cards in their
system right now is just one part about

65
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:48,069
the total times they received it can
also do things where compliance is in

66
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:51,589
order they can just start charging work
he's so your operational costs go up

67
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,520
over time and it isn't something that
happened just once they can do that over

68
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,308
a long period of time so if you're not
up to date maybe you just lose 1 percent

69
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:06,289
of your operational processing charges
for the next five years that that that's

70
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:17,039
a big deal it also these fines and
penalties can be there and so

71
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,350
in with their own terms these are my
penalties for you so you can really

72
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,850
really quickly

73
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:32,540
couple more things about PCI PCI is not
good security I want everybody to have

74
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,870
that in their head right away

75
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,330
PCI is a minimal set of its acceptable
to get is a big difference between those

76
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,960
and hopefully those people here to
security conference can understand the

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,520
difference do not ever think that yeah
we're we're PCI somewhere secure now

78
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,690
it's it's a bare minimum standard that
you need to be able to process of credit

79
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,469
card he's not just it's actually
everything that you do in your company

80
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,920
to make it work

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,200
PCI is never an exact procedures who
comes in usually vendors and saying we

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,479
have the exact PCI slow and everything
you need to do is always subject here on

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,870
business just like security if you look
at the way you're doing what your

84
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,240
applications are what your development
framework is to work within those PCI is

85
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,210
definitely not a requirement to buy any
single project product there are certain

86
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,150
things where there are approved vendors
or improved products in certain

87
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,080
categories that you can use for you look
to see if they did go through validation

88
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,270
process to help you in your PCI
compliance but you do not have to buy

89
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:46,859
any single day so what does he actually
cares about just this data that's all

90
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,340
there is if you look on your left hand
side these the ones most people

91
00:07:52,340 --> 00:08:00,830
regulation comes the actual credit card
number being secure the cardholder name

92
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,909
is actually important cuz that's only
occasionally use the expiration date is

93
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,220
important in the service the service
code is not the CVV number two different

94
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,810
i didnt be on the card

95
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,840
those visas data are the ones that you
can actually store and use for things

96
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,789
like recurring charges so these are
pieces of information if you're doing

97
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,930
renewals business so he might have to
score and work with the other side

98
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,969
though this was centered about
dedication to add a few were doing chip

99
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:43,240
data the CVV code so it's nice that
we're actually getting chips here in the

100
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,779
USA finally

101
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,459
but we're still being really dumb and we
don't actually do the PIN code to go

102
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,498
with him but he is accepting

103
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:55,819
present situation and you stored numbers
you'd be in big trouble

104
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:59,628
anything on that sensitive about an
occasion to decide if you actually write

105
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:05,759
it down anywhere in your system you're
in big trouble so that's a difference

106
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,920
delineating but those sites on the one
side you can store will get into how you

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,519
can store it you gotta keep the other
side do not store whatsoever by any

108
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:26,370
means if you notice a lot of information
that isn't in there like say social

109
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,950
security number and social security
numbers subject to PCI compliance

110
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:38,190
now he is now a good security if you
actually needed to store social security

111
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,800
number to you wanna keep it secure

112
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,979
yes your overall look into those things
to PCI itself doesn't care so that's

113
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,830
part of the one of those important
things to know the difference between a

114
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:58,130
compliance and security reduce right
things like customers password in this

115
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,720
case it's easy I could do consumers
really gonna carry it and it let them

116
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,880
get into their billing information

117
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,240
another question is what are you
certifying so in the world the PCI

118
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,420
there's actually its acronym hell there
are all sorts of different acronyms to

119
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,349
learning trying to distinguish between
them and one of them is just the bank

120
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:32,890
the PTI you're getting into a couple of
pts or pata better examples of different

121
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,779
PC eyes depending on what you doing

122
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,589
developing that actually you know breeds
chips that you can actually need to look

123
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,899
into stuff like the PTS congrats action
it has its own vacations system for

124
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,379
qualifying York where to be certified to
be sold it has a different set of rules

125
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,240
and things you need to do is still under
the general PC umbrella but separate

126
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,550
from say the PDS which is surprising
that you wrote to run payment processing

127
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,258
for somebody else to be sold a common
problem is a lot of people look at that

128
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,040
and say well I write software the disk
image processing so do I need to get PhD

129
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,990
assess your writing software for
yourself

130
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,449
know that only covers software that
you're selling as a drop-in PCI

131
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:25,790
compliant piece of software if you're
writing something for yourself just

132
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,610
regular PTI

133
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,690
then when you're doing the PCR you need
to understand what in SEQ it is accused

134
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,660
the self-assessment questionnaire which
is d how you go through and start

135
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,719
looking at Mi qualified to do I meet the
different items are several different

136
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:52,380
types of them if you're running just a
card making money while you need to find

137
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,029
which one of these you are how you
define that of course means your gonna

138
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,329
talk to your merchant account and
they're going to review what you do and

139
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,349
tell you which one you need but in
general this is what's important

140
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:10,610
Shuaa is the easiest one that's a cute
name means guess what we run credit

141
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,320
cards but its fall to their software
doesn't touch us get their

142
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:26,490
certifications would be important to
know we don't actually do anything

143
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,660
electronically doesn't it

144
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,260
terminals the only do business through
that you've got a special one if you

145
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,860
have a certified payment application and
you don't story you can do is see but

146
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,360
really 95% of people it's not really
just ask you which is everything else

147
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,410
category which means you have to go
through a lot more little checkboxes in

148
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:56,560
Review quite a few more things but you
do though is probably what you're gonna

149
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,910
need to process credit cards which means
you can apply BC I need to go through

150
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,640
all these different points does it do it
but hopefully that is but there's also a

151
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,660
couple points for the jargon you have
USA USA USA usually means it's the

152
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,230
outside do this

153
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,760
Security Essentials

154
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,160
they went through all the different
classes make sure they got certified so

155
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,760
that they can representing your company
inside that all the work was done

156
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,580
correctly

157
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,700
most companies which are going to use if
you're really small companies awesome

158
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,070
out really inexpensive ways to do York
USA civil service if you're medium-sized

159
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,220
companies going to cost a bit more
because this person see quite a bit more

160
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,140
work you'll see as we get into the
documentation section was quite a bit of

161
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,390
work this external person have to come
in they're going to spend time with

162
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,350
quite a few people in your company going
to paperwork double checking that you're

163
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,330
actually doing what

164
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,460
PCI compliance is so it's gonna take him
some time they're gonna fill out all the

165
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,970
paperwork and get it done you're gonna
sign off on their work and in a sign

166
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:21,220
saying yeah I verified this is true

167
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,279
but there are some other options if your
company is a little larger you can look

168
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,189
at a program in my day job what it is

169
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,240
allows you to qualify someone internal
to your company to do the exact same

170
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:44,600
words accuracy internally that she is
like most other certifications it's

171
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,980
going to take about five hundred dollars
in the first time you do it you're gonna

172
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,860
have to go to a remote training annual
reviews you can actually do online

173
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,500
though but it's actually really good
program if you want to take care of

174
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,250
yourself and if you want people to take
care of your PC I threw out here so it's

175
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,329
not just a single crunch at your renewal
point is also really good program to be

176
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:12,949
able to spread the load Little Joe PCI
we covered a lot of your business you'll

177
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:18,859
have everything from a jar sometimes
you'll have you have developers

178
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:27,860
representative correctly point out what
your practices are how your business is

179
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,350
working to improve each of these little
points each other's department as a

180
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,069
representative trained they can do the
people working they can make sure things

181
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,939
are in place ahead of time

182
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,248
but sufficient knowledge is you can get
it done

183
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:49,999
disease program for larger companies
like ours where it's just get things

184
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:55,379
through much faster now only important
things about the ISA though when you

185
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,739
qualify as an ISA you're not just a nice
day they can go anywhere you are

186
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:04,109
qualified only for the company you're
currently with so if you leave to go

187
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:05,019
somewhere else

188
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,239
nation is it anymore and that's where
the local radio city to make sure that

189
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,269
you know people wouldn't trade it in me
to be dumped somewhere else

190
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:23,529
some of the more information about PCI
PCI is a three-year cycle between

191
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,039
versions so you have a time where the
standards are published to review them

192
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,899
to give it up

193
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,959
adoption points within it make any
necessary changes and get things ready

194
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:40,748
for the next year's changes that need to
happen right now we're in the middle

195
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:47,509
point we're in pretty iverson story
technically 3.1 and if you are

196
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,949
interested you notice the October
november's when they have the open

197
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:54,030
meetings if you wanna do provide
information for

198
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,370
the next stages this is a committee a
group process that you can submit

199
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,800
information to do it changes sometimes
to watch and see who is submitting in

200
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,210
terms of businesses

201
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:11,520
onedirection people who know what's
going on security wise frivolity real

202
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,210
security it's time to get in there and
helping the sample some of the changes

203
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:23,380
that can happen during this stream is
recently we just had these three to 3.1

204
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,410
changes in july first things that came
out of course was deficit so you cannot

205
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:39,770
be PCI running any person or persons of
tlass anybody who security minded should

206
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,300
know that I guess what you need to make
sure your company that if you want to

207
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,550
run credit cards and other things that
changed in the three three-pointers some

208
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:55,020
of the things you need to do for
interesting review those we get to that

209
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:04,990
section so covering BC I basically gonna
try and take two days BC I treating

210
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,510
bring down to our next half hour of
things that in actually security minded

211
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,020
person will want to know about these
general sections of these you'll see

212
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,100
later number

213
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,610
section one building and maintaining a
secure network that actually is a full

214
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,860
section of PCI you have some toys toys
with in there are lots of little things

215
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:32,120
you need to check into sections like
that I'll give you this nice high level

216
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,500
so you can actually refer to it or know
where to look at something interesting

217
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,260
first thing of course says install
maintain a firewall configuration to

218
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,390
protect cardholder data the obvious that
you're processing records you want to

219
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,360
hire alright most people don't
necessarily think about that were think

220
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,959
about what it means to do a firewall
correct this is something that can help

221
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
keep you honest

222
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,309
people here are involved in their in
their company to get a couple of the

223
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:05,910
back there this worst areas once you're
gonna care about the most others not as

224
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:13,760
much attention here now the most
important thing in Boots in

225
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,840
documentation every one of these
sections in PCI the most important thing

226
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,280
is you have to have everything
documented will like crazy with accuracy

227
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,940
comes in they're going to ask to see
your network diagrams your second

228
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,400
inventory of that stuff

229
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,090
router configurations that documented
they also need to know all the change

230
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,840
management for making changes in there
and they're gonna need you to prove that

231
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,889
that's actually happening in the case
you want to get ready and your for PCI

232
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,230
Ethernet outskirts and make sure you
have all the paperwork otherwise you get

233
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,150
the QSA sitting in your office being
really tired and bored saying please

234
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,840
just make all this to me

235
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,289
things are going to check his day they
want to see the ingress and egress out

236
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:15,240
of your dad environmental they want you
to be able to prove that nothing can

237
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,119
happen out of what you've documented

238
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:26,738
part of that is there gonna wanna know
the scope of your system just text right

239
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:27,179
here

240
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,489
actually lifted straight out of three
the introduction to go being they they

241
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:38,159
give a description there what the
cardholder data environment his mother

242
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,279
was acronyms that they're gonna go
creative demanding to know city is that

243
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:48,499
in a world that you have to separate
this is my entire business this is the

244
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:52,859
piece of PCI actually cares about as you
start doing all the documentation you

245
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,319
realize really quick you want as many
things out of that Scopus you can

246
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,619
anything with the security minded person
you obviously important covering as

247
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:08,079
little of your footprint as possible
because that's the most so you need to

248
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:16,479
look at how can I segment network
limited devices the teachers at school

249
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:21,749
business really get a care about is
there's a lot of people don't don't

250
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:28,179
necessarily think about their security
minded his dad environment is your

251
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:34,220
device or statues it's your router's its

252
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:40,049
power systems are plugged into possibly
especially the effort to control its the

253
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:47,799
box itself right that those who reached
out to that reaches into those are

254
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,110
examples of what people don't think
about it boxes for your cardholder data

255
00:21:53,110 --> 00:22:01,418
environment and it needs to go and who
denounce resolution if the DNS resolver

256
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:06,130
is outside your cardholder data
environment so that people can actually

257
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:18,160
get is provided as spoofing so therefore
you're consuming is a part of your card

258
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,450
can be attacked be used to modify
environment so wherever you get your

259
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,450
anti-peace from your cardholder data
environments sometimes environment isn't

260
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:39,210
just there's a manual process has to say
that included or do something with it

261
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:47,820
also ruled their workstation environment
security person looks that immediately

262
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,780
says I need to know my focus that's a
good thing that's one of those things

263
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,629
you do throughout the year of limiting
your scope get it down to its small

264
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,100
footprint

265
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:03,830
security forces just the regular PCI
which it will explode because most

266
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:19,840
people don't think about just how far
some of the features their section do

267
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,060
not use of vendor supplied defaults

268
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,159
persistent really be a no-brainer right
now we don't we don't want something in

269
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,660
the our network that Soriano Cisco's
Monday that some people don't think

270
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:42,230
about those devices in the network and
then go to take that access away that

271
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:48,840
access away before the device was in
your network routing policies like that

272
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,590
that remove there's other kinds of
decency to take care of different places

273
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:05,110
in two different things that your system
just might do in general and that

274
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,120
behaviour moderated start-up teachers
and even operating system that you don't

275
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,899
need getting rid of things that really
don't need on the system

276
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:24,700
get down to the minimal things that you
want the next two sections of PCI cover

277
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:33,620
the actual def initself secure so that
we can actually use repeatedly well how

278
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,060
do we take care of that first of all
sorts of the minimum develop business

279
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,530
intelligence they're gonna say hey let's
just write everything down but think of

280
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,840
all the analytics we can do what we can
do it afterwards

281
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,970
yeah but also taken a year now liable
for everything you're holding ok so how

282
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,799
do I get rid of it

283
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,450
talk about data retention policies so
you need a point where he started credit

284
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,080
card at what point do you get rid of it
needs to be documented and you need to

285
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,678
show that you are actually getting rid
of cars that you no longer need security

286
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:20,760
is a way to get your PC I better once
again sensitive data can be stored and

287
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,730
that doesn't just mean things that you
intended to use even accidentally so

288
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,110
commonplace that people accidentally
stores indication that it is an access

289
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:38,120
log if you have any allows a get people
just do it gets treated have something

290
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,928
in there just a few blocks where maybe a
cordon for some applications dumps

291
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,320
memory it's getting written down there
if the baby comes in

292
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:58,980
find serious problems so you have to
look it approaches working with your

293
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,700
developers or your application provider
making sure that that doesn't get

294
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,170
written down in any way for any kind of
accident we've got modeled in that helps

295
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:15,580
with that in some of my day job stuff
we're even if somebody's sex on a box it

296
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,230
tries to jump record we have this other
process they catch things midstream and

297
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,740
will purposely get rid of anything that
we consider sensitive data CD be

298
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,080
anything like that will get truncated
removes and just mark with this would

299
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,800
happen accidentally showed up so that we
can monitor that tracking device that we

300
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,570
could have had a problem but we caught
it in time to think about where can I

301
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,840
accidentally be leaking this information
that I have one of my network admins

302
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,830
going to the router and you said you
know packet sniffing

303
00:26:52,830 --> 00:27:01,870
or something else in the information
that just street that's a problem

304
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,229
allowed in terms of protecting
cardholder data yet about how it's

305
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,410
transmitted

306
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:17,160
so is one of those things where I have a
great point BC I is not actually good

307
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:25,310
security PCI does not require you to
encrypt network connections on your

308
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:33,090
inside your CEO so you have to buy them
both to be in your network and in behind

309
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,760
a firewall there ok with you passing
play text I think that's just bad policy

310
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,460
encrypt it always that way if it
actually does leak or somebody gets in

311
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:52,170
your system it's still protected you do
have the required the PC I have any time

312
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,910
it is going over a public network you
need to make certain it's encrypted and

313
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,220
decrypted correct people just like I
mentioned you don't have to sell no

314
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,320
longer good enough to make sure that
you're not using it you probably noticed

315
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:15,919
sometime in June a lot of babes did a
lot of services we are upgrading and

316
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,620
will no longer be using as a july 1st is
their deadlines and they were going to

317
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,330
be cut off if they didn't have it
forcefully out by then

318
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:33,080
about the encrypted transmission there
are old system sometimes people they are

319
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,620
using a mainframe or something like that
they need me PCI compliant and that

320
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,070
means room only crowd tell me what do
you do you have to do something to get

321
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,510
that going over to something like that
you have to weigh great to be on Krypton

322
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:58,740
transmission and with storing your keys
please there there are great

323
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,400
presentations here I think on just like
with other topics to talk about what

324
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,770
real cryptography is to learn why you
don't use it if you're doing the right

325
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:17,610
thing to say about it but just know that
it is an earlier about some of the

326
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,360
problems with other types of
randomization you need to understand why

327
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,860
that's an issue you need to make sure
your developers understand why that's an

328
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,179
issue and how they can guarantee they're
not doing things you don't reinvent the

329
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,420
wheel

330
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,510
several different companies that they
come up with the next greatest thing on

331
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:43,690
how to start and end up being just you
know they tried to modulation and really

332
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,090
wasn't that hard recently able to break
it when testing

333
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,289
used tools this is one of those cases
where there are smarter people out there

334
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:56,610
used what they've already created
sometimes that might behave as

335
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,740
globalization service that's a great
idea you don't have the manpower to do

336
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,990
it right into tiny amount let them take
care of that for you and assume no

337
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,360
liability sometimes though maybe a large
number claim even maybe you've got

338
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:19,360
enough people in house you can do your
own organisation's

339
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,129
the reasons for it but there's a time
and a place for each of those in need to

340
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,720
decide based on what you have

341
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,610
make sure you doing real surge
validation as well especially with

342
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:41,000
recent attacks on the lower level RCA's
make sure your certificates are good on

343
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,429
them next to the ability management
program section 5 is one of those areas

344
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:57,059
that I hate the most PCI because the
most people tend to mess it up and this

345
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,740
is the one where people come in say you
need to run antivirus on your Linux box

346
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,780
it has to be like me happy because I
know that's a good one

347
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:13,320
mandated usually from an outside source
now with the system really senators did

348
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,100
you have a box that is subject to
attacks certain types of viruses Trojan

349
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:26,459
to separate you need tools in place to
prevent to detectives so as a security

350
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,630
minded person if your system
administrator take initiative make sure

351
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,179
you're doing the right thing

352
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:39,250
documented and make sure that your
automation system is enforcing it if you

353
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,130
want to if you're running Linux you
start using things like tripwire

354
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,169
intrusion detection systems may be Sadd
different tools like a document help

355
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:54,030
dole's are searching doing proper words
the mall where the response system of

356
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,908
their involvement

357
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:59,029
if you're using Windows maybe you do
want to use the telephone service or

358
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:03,379
whatever your decision is to make sure
you have a documented

359
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,849
enforce that it is raining and it's the
right tool for the job but don't let

360
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:13,229
someone come in and tell you that you
need to run a specific product because

361
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:29,019
of PCR take control of this do it right
doctor minute see developing maintain

362
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,869
secure systems and applications with
excellent actually really helps with

363
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:38,779
that easily actual there to the actual
parts from the section that are really

364
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:47,259
important so it's a process using
different reliabilities 30 systems out

365
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:53,929
there to do a PCR the actually weaker to
some of them and we got a nasty go

366
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,379
different tools like that

367
00:32:56,379 --> 00:33:02,259
subscribe to them know what's going on
be up to date her abilities and make

368
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:08,349
sure your patching for them in dealing
with that's exactly what this is some

369
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:13,279
kind of enterprise support software me
shirt sitting applied correctly

370
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:19,769
up-to-date yes it's a high-level you do
have one month to get another patch get

371
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:21,110
it in place

372
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,049
keep track of them up today it's your
responsibility you're signing off if

373
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,309
your system administrator that you're
doing this and that you're making sure

374
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:36,460
you guarantee it's applied to all the
right systems where if you're good

375
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:45,940
system administrator your feed from
Austin we're making sure that we take

376
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,510
your living this way that's what you
should be doing if you're already doing

377
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,240
your job right if you're out there
monkey fixing every single box just

378
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,559
because he'll be you heard about
something or you got routed the other

379
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,970
day you're reacting too late

380
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,590
once again there's other classes here
that you do that right where to look

381
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:12,000
how to do the right thing internally
developed that because it is measuring

382
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,918
its so you need to your system
administrator your network administrator

383
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,310
for developer you need to make sure your
policing the stuff that you use

384
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:26,109
internally and judge them by these rules
so if you let your junior system

385
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,960
administrator write some code that's
being rolled out on your router or two

386
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,859
years

387
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:35,679
your boxes to make sure that that was
double check trees

388
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,929
you get your senior developer whose King
on your credit card authorization form

389
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,679
for signing up we need to make sure you
didn't double checks and get that

390
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,809
correct

391
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,760
make sure that is being double checked
by someone who knows what they're doing

392
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:01,230
is able to test it correctly this means
you also need to make sure your training

393
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,500
developers administrators etcetera in
those policies and that's that's what

394
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,150
are the requirements that are in the
section Tues you have to make sure that

395
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,900
you're keeping them up-to-date but it's
not just one person who maybe hopefully

396
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,569
read this but it's actually disgusting
presented you know somebody found out

397
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:25,990
how to do cross border is on your your
signup page just made sure that

398
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:33,390
everybody knew how not to do that again
did you get that policy in place the

399
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:41,470
next couple sections access control
measures the meetings here is her

400
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:49,950
environment plz plz with denying people
access right nobody really needs to get

401
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,259
into that data to look at actual credit
card numbers

402
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,630
except in a very limited to cases and
you need to have a policy of enforcing

403
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:05,140
that people just get that data until
there's a need to know to go through the

404
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,020
proper checkpoints to get there of
course they're gonna care you go through

405
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:20,150
and everybody has unique IDs and

406
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,420
be shared accounts cardholder
environment please don't do that you

407
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,910
know you don't want to I people all uses
a customer support agents and you know

408
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,000
we don't care no you need to enforce so
you can track

409
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:44,510
control what they're doing that so
section 8 also has one of the other

410
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,480
points that I think a lot of us will
feel frustrated with the one that comes

411
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,289
up and requires some of the dumbest
password rules that you have experience

412
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:00,180
on the web and getting frustrated at
every time you see him this is the place

413
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,879
that says you can't use one of your last
for passwords right and you may be the

414
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,710
key idea except that means you have to
start the last four words to double

415
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,710
check against that's not to bad idea
it's all you have to change passwords

416
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,319
every 90 days

417
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,619
problems with that is also the one that
says you know minimum eight characters

418
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,170
must be at least

419
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:32,559
engines just work on actual real home
password to pass raising instead of

420
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,199
trying to do really limited entropy type
sets another discussion and once again

421
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:43,339
presentations here do a better job of
talking about secure passwords but there

422
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:47,449
are requirements in there and will you
endorse and their stupid but they

423
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:50,349
require

424
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:56,630
if you're doing things right in a card
not present situation which is doing

425
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:02,940
dinner purchases you don't actually see
the card then it's hopefully it just

426
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,469
means locking down your servers but
you're still defines as you're doing

427
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:13,819
that right so physical access means
anybody gives this box except two people

428
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:19,989
died so I need to make sure my boxes in
a lot track but not studio but only to

429
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:23,499
specify the Civic people can get in
there but it's not just the box once

430
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:30,149
again it's the hardware switches network
the powers to nobody get in touch with

431
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,650
your system to some other dorothy's to
be on the 787 at data center that

432
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,400
actually

433
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,470
has video chat you know checks and
monitors that stuff that happens you

434
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:46,069
don't get into it it's actually limits
so they're just a few sections and

435
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:51,930
therefore setting up to properly secure
data center section eight inspection

436
00:38:51,930 --> 00:39:04,618
91011 this is the one where most people
actually called out on so relieved

437
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,049
monitored in test network so a lot of
the times you'll have something people

438
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:14,869
say I set up a tool like sed it just
kind of dog to standard error syslog

439
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:21,119
baby milk somebody that a person gets
ten billion emails a day they already

440
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,859
have no filter devil in that thing
that's ok you actually have to have a

441
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:32,348
proper process people designated who's
monitoring system what is their SLA for

442
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:34,950
returning for noticing any of these
alerts

443
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,700
categorized correctly

444
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,790
interested to check whether in
government out 24 boxes incorrectly

445
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,110
hitting like that you need to have
documented policies and how that's

446
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,700
handled just watching it didn't notice
it what do they do when something goes

447
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:59,250
because it does one of the other day
this is where they served in the EU you

448
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,570
must use time synchronization systems
that sucked into this category instead

449
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:10,020
of one of the others other things
belonging itself where does that happen

450
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:19,240
well actually you need to make sure it's
done securely

451
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,339
make sure I have a remote syslog that
nobody else can write to her all turn

452
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:29,910
bigness of course the summit evenly over
the box with the first introduced during

453
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:35,279
cover up the trail that needs to be
somewhere else they can jack but this

454
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,800
also apply to your application
developers a lot of contracting I do is

455
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,720
typically on what people have done in
their applications for building the time

456
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,368
you've got a bunch of developers they
just simply enter this code and when the

457
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:55,300
shipment data base then we process I
just heard transaction that's not good

458
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,510
enough to actually have to store did it
with it it was the priest he was the

459
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:06,920
most state of all those things because
anytime back down the pan anything that

460
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,030
is accessed may need to know why I
wasn't even doing it he needed a nap

461
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:28,750
monitoring its first abusing the system
people just have one single set up a

462
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,530
source of the search to use that people
use this as a No

463
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,580
that's a big change those are separate
they do a lot of pushing for you know

464
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,900
our taxes leader stored procedures but
it's really necessary but you do need to

465
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,410
put some proper security mindset into
how do I get that data how do I make

466
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:57,049
sure I know when it was access was used
for now back at a later point in this

467
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,460
class earlier one of the points him it
was great where he talked about how long

468
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,320
to restore their networks blogs

469
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:11,900
we made it very easy so we can store
your data will gets what he says you

470
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,720
need to have a year of all your audit
logs available at three months

471
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:26,649
rapidly as the next part of that was
actually been testing this area that was

472
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,550
one of the areas I really like that was
approved in the 3.1

473
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,770
with scanning you have your ASP scan
which is what people know a lot about

474
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:41,450
you have to buy one of the approved
vendors that they'll come in quarterly

475
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,100
check your system and annually to put a
statement saying yes we're getting

476
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:53,259
scared and we passed really pretty much
every one of the vendors stocks in many

477
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,200
ways we've got a long list of friends
that we give them a lot of them do that

478
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,810
as a different presentation but as these
just try some days of testing of your

479
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,930
system and say hey did you get these
exploits now ok you're good it's a very

480
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,629
simplistic skating you can also do it
yourself with several types of a police

481
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,020
officer he just bring up calisthenics
got several tools in there you can do

482
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:24,230
some of your own scanning but it is
necessary to pay for it to get there you

483
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,140
can pick whichever you want some lenders
are better than others and sometimes

484
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,500
your merchant account will tell you do
not use vendor tax because we don't like

485
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,950
them they're too lenient if you've got a
good reason to suppose 11.3 is really

486
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,890
nice the actually introduced

487
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:46,759
requirements on actual penetration
testing you do need to get a real

488
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,370
external data environments in you that
you need to improve the documentation

489
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:58,799
and food involved in your PCI submission
but also under

490
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:05,249
43 you need to do internal testing so
you need to have people in your company

491
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:10,759
that are doing your own pen testing to
do a quarterly but you're supposed to do

492
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:16,400
it on any major config system or
application changes so you need to come

493
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,439
up with a group in your company that
knows enough about what is interesting

494
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:25,959
is you know come up with the red team
color of the blue team your system

495
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:31,439
go at it and then they need to review
and I mean the review groups just says

496
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:34,969
qualified personnel if you're here
you're probably one of those people you

497
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:40,999
can find the other ones in your company
do quarterly reviews that a minimum also

498
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:45,698
tie the Ministry rollout process get
that done so that you can make sure you

499
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:51,439
are actually secure so this is a really
good enhancement PCI take advantage of

500
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:57,098
that point where I can use PCI to my
advantage and make sure we're actually

501
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,689
been testing our stuff and reviewing it
and you don't make the good work with

502
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:04,720
what we got out of the radio

503
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,368
so the last section of TCI section 12:18
a policy that addresses is usually

504
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:17,240
called the age our section of a lot of
it has to do with major policy to do

505
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,919
with how do I know the people that work
record holder environment route back to

506
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:32,880
this is tons of paperwork yet to ensure
the security policy response

507
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,099
security awareness program to be in
these are two different some point since

508
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:44,529
it has to be given on how to explain to
them and they have to sign off saying

509
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:49,529
they received it and understand it and
it has to be renewed annually with each

510
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:55,920
employee in that environment now
sometimes it's just busy work but if

511
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,039
your security minded and you get really
frustrated with the people around you

512
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:05,359
this is a great chance to get the word
out to take advantage of this and make

513
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:11,339
sure things are going on there many
times community don't stand cardholder

514
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:15,328
data in the open this is where we've
pushed back on the guess what your

515
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:21,549
penalty will be if you you know I am
somebody a credit card number and we did

516
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:26,400
that because people kept doing it we
have someone the other day you came in

517
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,670
so we we have customers that we needed
proof of identity so we just have them

518
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:46,160
email us a copy of your credit card
right before our renewal and so we just

519
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,950
said you just made our entire email and
ticketing systems in scope

520
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:57,839
you realize how much work that created
for us so we have to get people down

521
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:04,349
again and show where they messed up but
just need to the company we had to do it

522
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:10,839
how we were able to get the information
out of 12 is thr section that's a lot of

523
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:15,460
a lot of the other documentation you
gave the other sections and making sure

524
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,020
their standardized they're known across
the company

525
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:25,009
other PCR really important compensating
controls compensating controls are the

526
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:33,640
PCR requires this we do something
different reason and you have to come to

527
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,480
city controlled document for each of
those things saying why we do something

528
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,670
different now it's better than the
control that's in place and you have to

529
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:47,119
prove it for each one you have to get in
and then it has to get approved for

530
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,640
commercial providers don't mention
compensating controls in the last thing

531
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,078
that's what's really important a lot of
people say I'm getting to the pics do a

532
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,320
compensation costs exceed that supplied
doesn't work we'll immediately say no

533
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,600
you are either PCI all the way 100
percent for you are in process of

534
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:17,160
working on it and therefore not so those
are just the

535
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,009
passwords for access to the spots that
have to meet these requirements but we

536
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,260
actually used to keep a stop in
occasionally use the other two factor

537
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,210
authentication system that's actually a
better than requirement and we're using

538
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:38,250
the state of Massachusetts great
composition control is causing it to

539
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,970
summarize real quick BC I is a complex
bureaucracy made up of a bunch of card

540
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:50,368
networks banks that are trying to cover
their own but it's great but if you want

541
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:56,819
to play in the world of credit cards you
have to learn BC I is being here is a

542
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:01,970
great first step the real security
discovered to the rest is great stuff

543
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:07,500
use it and with the knowledge you get
there a little bit PCI you can use the

544
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,390
PCI to enforce changes are better
security don't just let things happen

545
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,098
let someone else besides some of that
but actually take advantage of PCI to do

546
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:23,569
the right thing because of that
documentation is over there will know

547
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:29,538
today work is I need the documentation
you need to show me what the policy is I

548
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:32,470
need it written down I need the flow
charts

549
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,240
any disease process flow data flow I
need to see all the hardware we're all

550
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,750
the routes are and have a proven soviet
document at first as a lot easier that

551
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:47,220
guys get your desk breathing down your
neck second he deceived us I need to

552
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:55,020
take this any decisions that you got it
documented the script you can write the

553
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,630
script you can read the puppet manifest
whatever and just make it happen

554
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,460
automatically

555
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,660
don't let things be special snowflake
special snowflakes break they believe

556
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,220
they will melt there will be problems
but actually make sure the plan leaves

557
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,240
your automation system and is enforced
asserted everywhere whether you're in

558
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,368
there were cops with a year no doubt
whether you're a developer administrator

559
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:27,609
it applies the same major influences
what you're doing now if you have a

560
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:33,750
problem with your merchant account right
away they want open discussions if you

561
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,430
are having trouble getting PCI certified
if you have an issue talk to them they

562
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:44,049
often great shoe extensions is you're
doing to work if you're moving ahead and

563
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,200
say yeah you're doing the right thing
let's let's see when you get that done

564
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,279
will help you with that if you lie about
it though

565
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:56,299
they come in to see an issue that's
