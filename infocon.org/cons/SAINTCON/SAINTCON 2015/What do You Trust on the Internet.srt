1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,080
since I started working there and I'm
gonna talk about the doctor content

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,969
trust feature and technologies that went
into making it happen I don't know if

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,929
we're supposed to do

4
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,329
audience interaction but how many people
here have used doctor before only a

5
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,319
handful alright I'm gonna do it quick

6
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:28,429
crash course doctor and when I talk
about dr. in five minutes when I usually

7
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:34,519
talk about it for about six hours so
doctor of course is a way to run

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,870
processes containers and its big
value-add is I can easily create a

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,140
container and as far as that process is
concerned it's an uncertain environment

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,150
with a certain file system with Danny's
about that environment and I can move

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,079
them around to different places for the
processes point of view it works the

12
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,970
same as I can go from my laptop to
server to it just talked to Deb server

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,829
and the name running in the container it
works pretty much the same that's

14
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:18,029
there's a huge value add but the
security part of that comes into play

15
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,280
because you're moving around eight files
that could potentially have been

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,689
tampered with at some point which is
where the doctor content trust feature

17
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:39,758
comes in so basically the motivation
behind the contrast beach was to provide

18
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,749
guarantees to the these things are you
down like running doctor to doctor

19
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:56,889
images and it uses specification
framework which is generic specification

20
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:02,110
for a way to build a secure software
updater and we'll talk a little bit

21
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:08,008
about tough and how that flows in we use
project called notary which was created

22
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,940
at Dr which is an implementation of
tough and the doctor content just

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,440
feature itself utilizes notary notary is
generic enough you can take it to other

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,390
cool stuff not seen some compact 80
projects out the wild with notary

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:33,839
a few months old and it's actually
really cool so the first question that

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,670
comes up to a lot of people that are in
the know about packaging and stuff when

27
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,609
when we talk about the contents feature
is why didn't you just use DVD and I'll

28
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,010
be honest I was in that camp before I
learned about and what it was but it

29
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,989
brought to the table

30
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,070
Linux user who made a clean install the
arch maintain earners have signed all

31
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,790
their packages and GPG signature
verification and burn I know that this

32
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:11,230
package came from the culture and that's
good I also use GPG in my email email I

33
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,280
can sign it and you know just five years
ago really did come from him assuming

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,320
that he will not compromise but there's
a couple of things that GPG doesn't do

35
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:36,650
that well when it comes to when it comes
to software updater so if I'm installing

36
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,650
a package and install going into the
five year time period i install an old

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,870
version of OpenSSL I might be instantly
partly but that package was signed by

38
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,190
the maintainer in that package has not
been tampered with since since it was

39
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,250
last published so there's there's a need
because of that for there to be some

40
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,750
other guarantees

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,130
around this package that goes beyond
just a simple signature there's also be

42
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,549
problem

43
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,020
public keys from your maintainer your
publishers out your user to how do you

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:22,950
know that those keys really are from the
proper channels that burning is gonna be

45
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,330
on the end user which is ok for advanced
users but if not invest user I still

46
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,500
need to be able to get software updates
in a timely manner so just simple GPT

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:43,800
alone is everything so we have to
provide some other guarantees and things

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,850
on top of so that's kind of what does
some of the other than the other

49
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:57,760
concerns when you are running a software
repository signing dozens there's a

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,030
whole list of other attacks can be done
I can I can if I compromising your as it

51
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,039
hacker I could cause a mirror to send
just an endless stream of beer to

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,740
someone checking for updates and that
includes data could potentially do

53
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,740
neither service there's still up with
Ram and then fall over and die and

54
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,150
that's an attack that could happen

55
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,200
signing the loan doesn't know thing that
could happen and i've i've actually

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,020
remember having this happen to me with
arch several years the mirror I was

57
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,979
using stopped are seeking so I did I was
not getting updates any package I tried

58
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:43,630
to install signed by two weeks or two
months older how long was that I

59
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,360
realized I wasn't getting updates that
was my fault because i didnt configure

60
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,450
there is properly but it happened to me
and it could happen if an attacker

61
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,440
compromises in here they could just 32

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,790
stay on your old packaged versions and
we are building a popular

63
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,060
you can you will that attacks going back
to the harp leader where to go story any

64
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,870
other number of vulnerabilities I can
find an old saying package insert it

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,340
into the pipeline and in your installer
would just take it and use it

66
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,719
potentially so there's lots and lots of
things that we need to protect ourselves

67
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,270
against to protect our USERs against
beyond just simple object verification

68
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,469
any update from work out this is kind of
their mission statement

69
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,370
software update system is secure if it
can be sure that it knows about the

70
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,280
latest available updates and timely
manner any files downloads are the

71
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:56,309
correct files and no results from
checking or downloading files in this

72
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,710
concept already but the core concepts of
tough to guarantee freshness and also

73
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,640
talks about online courses on key
security so for example if I am I J

74
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,630
conservatives publishing my artifacts I
might want to have it do signing for me

75
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:23,080
so I'm gonna have an online key on my
chicken served its purpose and that is

76
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,280
very nice for convenience for consumers
compromise now an attacker concern as if

77
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,140
it were me and that's bad so the
solution but now i cant do automatic

78
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:45,889
publishing repositories in a safe so
there's tradeoffs key security

79
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:54,080
strategies tough tries to take each
strategy and apply those two rules were

80
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,748
having the most sense and was a little
bit more that a little bit the other

81
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:04,590
concept that tough has kind of guys back
into the freshest I'm signing a

82
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,090
collection so these are my valid
artifacts may be the latest LPS release

83
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:18,060
and then if something is no longer valid
maybe I there's a vulnerability okk that

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,659
object out that person out with another
version of current stable things has

85
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:39,750
changed so I i'm not just something one
off jects their balance forever so did

86
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,750
the update framework defines these
different rules for teens so tough

87
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,800
repository there is a concept of Haruki
so every single te that comes out of

88
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,269
this republic stuff repository will be
key the roots he is the world i'm gonna

89
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:11,500
wanna take and offline and walked out
and see so once I generate my routine I

90
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,990
can generate my snaps on and then target
key and those actually are used can be

91
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,180
several online keys and those are
actually use the stomach contents he

92
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,229
just signed psyches so it's is analogous
certificate authority but not really

93
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:38,440
difficult and then the timestamp key
that's potentially a live on the actual

94
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,050
reference repository that is accessible
on the public's as timestamp key its

95
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,180
role is to guarantee freshness

96
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:57,130
so many anything signed by this
afternoon target ki qasam se as its time

97
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,100
it is valid

98
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,220
you you want the verifications done by
the time they have a very low

99
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:11,360
exploration maybe five or ten minutes so
you can be sure that it's pretty reason

100
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,850
we recently been 10 minutes i think is
very reasonable and you can get in any

101
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:28,399
implementation you can choose or so
that's on the front line servers steps

102
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,020
on targets keys that actually signed my
heart that can be imagined conserve my

103
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,500
dead laptop or whoever does the release
and then the rupee I mean it take out

104
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,630
put it on my website module or a USB
Drive or printed out if I'm crazy in AC

105
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:56,730
Milan need to pull that out if I wanna
make new hampshire target so I took away

106
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,580
for indefinite and telling me to make
changes so no hurry it's an

107
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,720
implementation of tough and it's
actually a fairly opinionated

108
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,970
implementation of tough its role is to
make it easy to adopt her life like this

109
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,170
they they honestly simple fighter itself
there's a lot of moving pieces I didn't

110
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,219
really understand I read the whitepaper
two or three times but no reason just a

111
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,150
very simple interface I have to really
worry about as a content publishers that

112
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,400
I need to take my past three and then as
an end user I don't really need to do a

113
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,020
whole lot other than turning on to it it
makes all of these concepts be

114
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,400
transparently easy to work with

115
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,340
is open source it was announced and open
source at dr cohn and San Francisco this

116
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:58,480
year and one important thing to note is
that validates the publisher and not the

117
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,200
actual safety of the content so if you
come across something that says a botnet

118
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,190
it's probably still a bad idea to run
even if it's from the abundant publisher

119
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,110
so you still have to do some of their
own words it's not a guarantee of safety

120
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:27,880
just so basically notary runs a
client-server model so there is a server

121
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:37,930
running somewhere and be the one for dr.
images is hosted by dr. the notaries

122
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:45,699
signer it holds just the timestamp key
so in this public implementation of

123
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,870
notary for dr. that time stamp use
actually held by a doctor so it's

124
00:12:52,870 --> 00:13:00,220
actually a third parties so if they lose
that he gets compromised you only have

125
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,130
the freshest guarantee compromise but
not the actual original content so

126
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,510
they're the only team that I have the
least control of history the impact if

127
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:15,120
there's something so here I am i'ma
content publisher Simon have my office

128
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:23,560
keys and I'm you can also have a cabin
key and they can have a combined the

129
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,839
tough rules of stamps on targets in 21
role so logically and notaries

130
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,280
implementation opinionated is it's a
tagging just makes people's last checked

131
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:46,890
they could have changed so I can become
temple sure I can assign undertaking

132
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,970
keys to my other developers

133
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:56,569
anyone that I want to be allowed to sign
a document a kinky and the rupee safe

134
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:10,290
and then the end users they can verify
my content based on the key that was so

135
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,079
I have attacking keaton was compromised
tough took into account the fact that

136
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,008
someone's laptop is getting it left in a
taxi or whatever with GPT it can be

137
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:35,250
tricky to do to reject the key to
invalidated key that you don't have any

138
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:46,540
more so in this case might compromise
for my recuse myself so I take it take

139
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,939
out the weekend to myself and I say that
he's no longer any good but I can make

140
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,939
another one and then I would have to
retype any content to sign with the

141
00:14:54,939 --> 00:15:00,529
compromise key and we pushed aside
medidata and my users really don't

142
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:07,370
notice any difference at all at that
point so that's really handy on the only

143
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,470
thing that the user would see as if
being compromised he was used to sign

144
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:19,199
package that they should have signed but
once that he is tax compromise if they

145
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,219
try and run that content it'll stop and
say hey this is compromise that's that's

146
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,120
really the only interaction we want the
users to have to consume Dr images is

147
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,490
there's a problem

148
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,250
content trust victim because there's
actually a compromise

149
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,550
and that's the only time a shitty even
ever see any such error messages so

150
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:51,859
that's good so how do our end users know
what our keys are so the key

151
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:58,850
distribution aspect of this user trust
on first use through tOSU trust on first

152
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,780
use so anyone that has ever used a Save
As Seen the players you trust this

153
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,270
course everyone always double check
every digit of the fingerprint and says

154
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,939
yes I trusted that gets added to your
house and then every time you connect to

155
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,660
a server after that it verifies based on
what it saw the first right that's a

156
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,819
trusting person you swallow so notary
and tough use the same type of system we

157
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:37,200
have a little extra protection on the
trust Him first use in no hurry over the

158
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,940
traditional as a statement uses because
the public key the public key for a

159
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,930
repository get sent over the TLS
connection so the notary server as a TLS

160
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,180
certificate so your party can verify
that the server is who it says it is

161
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,640
when you get the public key and then he
distrusted armed forces use as a seat

162
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,970
just sent you a public key there is no
other verification certificate a six

163
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,079
security is pretty good in my book I
think that the trust on producing oil

164
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:25,109
because let's face it the same stuff
works it's proven model

165
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:37,419
feature for a seat for the trust on
first use model and I actually have that

166
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:43,280
enabled so I think it's good I don't
know how that would relate to know tree

167
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,960
but I will run by the notary teen and
see what they think it's interesting

168
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,559
it's an interesting comment

169
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,399
the late the top of my head

170
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,750
notary and dr. content trust in general
tries to kind of hiding handle this for

171
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,740
you so we're relying on things like
Sheila certificates to provide that

172
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,980
rather than the usual but I could see
some debug output being under useful but

173
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,040
I don't think it would enhance too much
basis over what we have in the current

174
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,960
model but that's my opinion and why I
loved it bounced off of the retail sales

175
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:36,710
so I can do that and get back to you
after the presentation ok so customers

176
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,110
to use it works it's good so first time
I see a key I'll trust it so if I'm

177
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,959
playing down the image I will get the
routine that corresponds with that and

178
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,230
then that we can use that Ricky forever
and it never changes it's going to be a

179
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,130
very very bad copy and print users cuz
it's gonna look just like it

180
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,230
attack so it's very important to have a
tricky safe and secure and not

181
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,500
compromise

182
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:14,760
fortunately it is easier to keep up with
this model then otherwise so now we have

183
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,540
the ability to sign stuff how does that
relate to dr. itself there is only a

184
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,330
couple hands saying yes I used to doctor
so doctors images are basically Sharples

185
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,559
and then so if I pull down a boot image
it's gonna pull down one terrible for

186
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,149
each layer for use as a layering files I
have based image layer on top of

187
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:52,120
ancillary might be installing gym or
Emacs so whatever files installed I can

188
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,529
do it did and see hey these new files
are here and I can take that and make

189
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,049
that into a layer on top of the image
then I take the group to image a quicker

190
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:06,639
way on top of it results players now
have a complete view with Emacs so

191
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:14,879
images are just a bunch of players and
and then there's a collection of

192
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,760
medidata that says hey these are layers
so we just now need to cryptographically

193
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,460
referred to the medidata so my type
repository says the this image

194
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,830
repository as this meted out and at
medidata says there are these layers are

195
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:41,289
here are the shot 250 256 checks so now
I can establish

196
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:46,039
turtles all the way down into something
that phrase I didn't the first time I

197
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,179
came across the slide that's terrific
Smith College or something like that so

198
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,210
it's talking about Merkel tables so I
have the manifest each

199
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:06,100
treat or treat sorry so each player has
its shot 256 checksum and I to him

200
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,899
potentially different layers and
manifest the parent manifest is what I

201
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:18,229
notary Dr stress so I have this chain of
trust all the way down to the actual

202
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:27,080
files from the totals since I saw 1900
see was not forever

203
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:36,519
so the the way to enable content plus
there's two ways to do it it's a new

204
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:44,640
feature as a doctor 1980 which came out
six weeks ago give or take

205
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,230
and its costs by default because it's
brand new and 19 actually comes out

206
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:58,289
tomorrow it's still unable to 19 but we
do want to enable it and have it be the

207
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:06,019
default in the future so we have this
other way to any more content just down

208
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:11,269
here it says disabled content trust
equals false and that's kind of weird

209
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:16,760
but once we do go to content on by
default then there's this flag it's just

210
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,039
gonna be disabled content rise and that
makes sense that's why that looks

211
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:29,158
awkward so let's do a demo I don't know
if you guys are going to be pleased or

212
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,929
not so I have a shell here it has to be
running in the container just to set up

213
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:42,159
my environment I have I'm running my own
local registry registry is the thing

214
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,309
that story's images for dr. morning
locally instead of using a public 1 I'm

215
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,850
also running my own notary server
locally so I'm not watching uproot

216
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:57,219
season I can never change to the public
notary server so I can sell everything

217
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:05,710
we've done so it's a nice day so right
now I have Dr content trust so I'm gonna

218
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,770
do doctor run

219
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:16,460
and

220
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,400
Dr runs is a shortcut for creating and
inserting an image and then a shower and

221
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,750
says remove the container when it exited
a shy teen says I'm attaching thereto

222
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,050
including I'm allocating pseudo ttyl
registry 5,000 refers to my local

223
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:44,530
registry server and endemic was the name
of the image so we'll see if it works so

224
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:54,260
this is intense rust off so it pulled
each layer downloaded it hard the tar

225
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,370
balls created the container which
assembled mounted the layered file

226
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,459
system which later I noticed that there
is a digest here so one of the features

227
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,850
added I think and dr. 17 was falling by
digester we use that I just refers to

228
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:18,620
the manifesto so it down to the image
granite exit so now that I've read an

229
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:29,239
image I'm gonna do the same thing doctor
content trust 10 now I do a doctor run

230
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,120
its going to reach out to the notary
server and clients find trusted data and

231
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,770
once I find that trust data and I'll try
and pull the corresponding image by John

232
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,510
rather than by this name that's kind of
loosely defined so this just failed

233
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,120
because I haven't actually published to
be meted out so since I happened to also

234
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,750
controlled us registry and content
publishers of this image let's let's

235
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:05,190
push them down so doctor push registry
call in five thousand / demo so this is

236
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,510
the normal interface for watching images
normally when I pushing image without

237
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,750
content trust it just goes since this is
the first time I'm pushing it to me for

238
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:22,500
a passphrase iraqi so I'm really asking
for a password is my targets he will

239
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,540
create that will sign the content with
them and then push everything up to the

240
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:36,170
registry in a notary no text specified
so one of the things in in doctor is

241
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:45,250
this year registry call 5000 / demo that
is the main image and without content

242
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:52,270
Trust I've tended push images without
calling latest and it's implied by

243
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,070
content trust they decided that they
didn't want any implicit behavior when

244
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,310
signing and putting meted out so I have
to you explicitly add latest harm or if

245
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:09,360
I had another tack I could be too if I
had such a decade or so now I'm gonna

246
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:29,270
push it it's literally with the tax code
name for this image so

247
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:39,350
created attacking key repository for
some reason here and my roots he has

248
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:45,840
signed a kinky and tagged pushed
everything so then I have content

249
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,500
available so let's go back to this run
some good as the same command but

250
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,330
content rest in a world with trust data
available so here we go

251
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:06,480
yet found by the image downloader new
image and there it's only get my shot

252
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:17,950
and then tags this long fancy Shawnee to
the latest name that's implied and then

253
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:26,820
ran my application so I've just done
content trust live demo demagogues but

254
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,810
what if someone like my registry

255
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:44,040
shell into my registry so for those who
aren't familiar I'm running my registry

256
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,090
as another container and the doctor and
take command tells me a run this other

257
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:55,610
process of its existing herself I do
accept cash with standard and and so

258
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,209
ttyl allocated

259
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,950
interactive Paschal in this running
container so so now i'm happier on the

260
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:11,060
red team and I'm gonna go ahead in half
this demo application so it's hacked so

261
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:18,860
what what I've just done is I have lots
to manifest for this repository with a

262
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,629
repository that run some code that is
China's malicious so so now the time has

263
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,120
come to exit the shelter registry and if
I run this

264
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,449
what's gonna happen is it's going to get
the content trusted Eric from the rotary

265
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:43,930
server since I have already ruled this
image has valid point and it's just

266
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,870
gonna use what's here locally so this is
actually just gonna work so that's kind

267
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,830
of cool I've just hijackers repository
but since I have a local copy and I'm

268
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:04,300
saved already by content trust clinton
trust and then I run it it doesn't know

269
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,770
check to just uses what is already local
so I'm also save a little bit but I do a

270
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:16,970
doctor poll and registry for 5000 / demo
it did you just downloaded the malicious

271
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:28,720
damage so now that if I write so

272
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:38,100
turned content goes back on and try it
one more time I'm running the right

273
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,600
things so constant stress is actually
kind of hard to break it actually is

274
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,770
doable with content just enable their
see what it does

275
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,370
all right it saw that I i up-to-date so
it isn't trying its I'm actually can

276
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:04,570
remove it since I can try and actually
pull it over my house and / demo so

277
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,928
we're doing this image from my local
cache of images of got a question in the

278
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:29,330
back

279
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:40,600
so my my my demo was just it is it's not
real applications that when I DR run

280
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,929
something it can be anything and for
this game he'll go Monica I believe is

281
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,480
the only put it together he's he's the
security specialist doctor he just did

282
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,760
that so colorful and looked all the
hackery I think he's behind the train as

283
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:05,980
well yeah yeah it's just it's just a
bunch of gibberish sorry I mean go ahead

284
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:13,820
and remove this image and hopefully it's
really gone actually do a heavy hits a

285
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:24,999
darker images Q experts

286
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,909
I'm deleting any image that's not in use
basically and strangling the ones that

287
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:34,429
are absolutely images good player has
its alrighty so now I'm gonna try and

288
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:41,939
people I don't think I shouldn't have
them locally and its image on the

289
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:50,089
registry in the content posted able to
we should see interesting yeah it was a

290
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:56,239
shock so it it still saves me from from
the attacks I care doctor kinds of

291
00:31:56,239 --> 00:32:02,249
systems is tricky to break so soon after
I run I still have a good to correct

292
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:09,229
image so that's just a manifest so
contentious basically gives me a pointer

293
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:15,689
to the real manifest no matter what I do
so that that's really nice so what

294
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:22,509
happens if I hit him with a layer though
I can definitely do that doctor Xing

295
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:37,290
back to my registry and then they made a
very good

296
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:50,730
so this one of the layers in this image
so if I do something malicious I've just

297
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:57,100
alter this layer without content recite
guess I have this extra in my lair and

298
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:04,959
that could potentially be malicious just
breaking the law breaking the the

299
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,370
passing checksums perform right now
though so it's going to get out and I'm

300
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,239
gonna try to be able to do that

301
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,000
image removal get it

302
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,090
I've just tried to tamper with layer
upon layer verification failed to digest

303
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:41,250
so now I can be sure my images are not
tampered with the world is it working

304
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:47,170
its magic in the background so I can be
sure that the manifest in being said

305
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:58,090
when I do appeler everything is correct
so that is my demo for their temporary

306
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:05,000
03 also has its own command line tool I
don't have a demo setup for it but you

307
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,560
can do fancy things with your tougher
pot with your notary repository if you

308
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,299
use the command-line client so it's a
separate ruling install doctor so if any

309
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,200
do irritation or delete tags out of the
repository for stuff like that I will be

310
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:29,418
using the notary command-line tool and
there is a bit of a road map but still

311
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:35,949
being developed and features being added
the basis of course works we just tried

312
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:43,109
it we have images designed I can verify
that they came from where they said they

313
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:51,879
came from doctors official images are
also signed so when I run Ubuntu or in

314
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,480
genetics my SQL or any of the official
images i can text content just enabled

315
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,700
and that's really nice

316
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:19,828
accepting pull requests to dr. dash
trust on freenode is where the notary

317
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:52,690
and trustee boats so any other questions

318
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,400
the question well as it looks like this
can be applied to things other than

319
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,310
darker images could be used for non
sulfur content even possibly news

320
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,740
articles from a new sorts so I was the
question the answer is yes absolutely no

321
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,259
they could be used to sign any sort of
content the demo they did when they

322
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:19,119
announced notary was actually signing a
bash script talking about the girl

323
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,950
pipetter that we see in our industry you
can actually do the curl type 2 military

324
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:32,379
pipe to bash and then if it gets
tampered with it will will stop and that

325
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,460
was why I really enjoyed watching that
memo that the regime did when it was

326
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,210
brand new because it will type 2 batches
something that's not very well-liked but

327
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:49,440
very prevalent right now when do you go
did it when he tampered with the bash

328
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,710
script he actually has installed at his
age was our index RSS / and he didn't

329
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:03,579
live and it worked so he followed two
demos that didn't go so well he was

330
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,990
nervous but yes absolutely nobody can be
used to say your vacation pictures or

331
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:17,899
whatever any non content to ask
questions or does it have to be notary

332
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:35,160
can be anything doctor I'm here

333
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:43,629
has there been any progress best
practices around managing secrets in

334
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:51,630
doctor and the answer to that is yes you
can use any secret distribution

335
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,530
mechanism that makes sense

336
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,340
doctors high enough level tool that
doesn't like you in one thing that's a

337
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,120
good and bad thing because it it's nice
when there's like one holy grail way to

338
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:10,319
do something and that's obvious best
practice with my experience with other

339
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,550
tools like chef even the best practices
they seem so quickly I will point out

340
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:22,750
the fact that dr. 129 that is coming out
tomorrow as dr. bullying him some

341
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:28,480
command volumes are now first-class
citizens you could potentially manager

342
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,050
secrets and Williams and since there are
not this ephemeral of your week

343
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:42,060
residents of State will lose their
little more than a first-class citizens

344
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,810
I guess it might be more savory solution
to use thought it was just a few secrets

345
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:55,310
and volumes particularly I'm saying like
SSL Certificates running an SSL

346
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,529
certificate I mean higher up container
and I'm gonna put that all you and that

347
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:05,280
blames colleges can be directly on the
host of the night I deal with getting up

348
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:14,330
there with SSH or whatever other like I
could use TAS DVD and get decrypt it as

349
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,089
I deployed so

350
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,650
yeah I I'm a big fan of Jackass and
there's there's no reason you can't do

351
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:33,019
that with dr. consider anything a
doctor's questions

352
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:39,160
alright sold thanks for coming everyone
I appreciate it
