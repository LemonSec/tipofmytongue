1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:11,719
clear gonna be talking about turning
left that so here who here has now noted

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,520
that the MRT

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:34,129
probably be so we're gonna play to use
your own presentation today who wants a

4
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:46,349
basic overview as opposed to just
drinking from so so higher raise your

5
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:58,149
hand and basic overview resume looks
like the fire hoses can win so if you

6
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,219
have any questions

7
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:13,250
the presentation is in in the
presentation files because it's a just

8
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,590
can I read this last night so if you go
to security systems dot com you can

9
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:26,450
download presentation may be a better
view what I'm talking about her to read

10
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,780
the system's dot com

11
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:39,200
security researcher it's kind of a hobby
and software developer during the navy

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:49,030
blue team choose secure systems systems
like play both teams member of PCA

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,220
taiwan working with those guys for the
past three years is doing some fun stuff

14
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:02,800
left akers' face to face reality for
user groups like the Seattle one so

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,970
you're interested in doing some packing
and let the heavy come out and hang out

16
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,949
and stuff

17
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:21,579
about so great opportunity to speak on
22 and 23 I got my start here saying

18
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,370
Come here so I'm excited Peters has been
great conference inman great for my

19
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,030
career so there's plenty of opportunity
for you guys out there take advantage of

20
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,519
it

21
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:40,340
additionally also part of the podcast
the web security worries podcast

22
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,640
interested in hearing more about web
security you know stuff

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,649
security systems

24
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,190
the main thing that we need to think
about it availability right if we have a

25
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:10,140
secure system and it doesn't work we
have nothing to get over this section

26
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:21,250
for Linux gardening gardening operating
system so we're gonna drink from the

27
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:28,180
fire house today today is his heart rate
we're going to go through all the little

28
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:44,569
things that needed to secure systems
owned a really good ones here so basic

29
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:52,560
install skip over the pics hard just
can't talk about mentoring partitions so

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,980
one of the things you want to do when
you securing system under five different

31
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,569
applications operating system in your
application to different partitions the

32
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:11,380
reason we do this is that if one of them
gets stopped breathing system

33
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:20,110
won't stop system from running as we can
see when things are running in when

34
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:28,310
they're not when you know when
something's happening additionally 822

35
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:37,000
no intrusion detection system it's very
basic one

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,610
and what it does just take them to fight
hash critical file system files and

37
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,150
create a database so when you do your
head in it you gonna take that hates

38
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,030
file story of the system because it's on
your system and get through my texts

39
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:01,179
they can do and even read the intrusion
detection database and everything works

40
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,680
fine

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,670
additionally on a perfect USB storage
mounting we're gonna need password

42
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:18,770
security here at the often picks so we
go through all these settings so we're

43
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,870
gonna have strong as an authentication
this is her just basic lock in their

44
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,990
panties system you want to have maximum
power hazard attempts at night for sale

45
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,240
password attends

46
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:46,630
password reviews and then there's so
many questions so going too fast too

47
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,529
slow

48
00:05:50,529 --> 00:06:00,039
require authentication for single-user
mode so yes it collects in Linux system

49
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,079
we want to make sure that they have to
enter a password so this means that we

50
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:11,239
can change the password unless we on
mount the image is the root password and

51
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,849
we have to reset it we have to remember
the image to go and then modify files

52
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:22,079
and do things they will control early
sorry boo activation so here just going

53
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:35,169
into this control and redirecting its
just the logs from prison system so now

54
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:41,119
you get internet working in the Linux
you want to disable IP version 6 for not

55
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,829
using it right if you're not using
something turned off

56
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:51,869
naval the umask 077 which basically what
the UMass just everytime you touch if I

57
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:57,279
do anything to file it says the
permissions set by doing this you 77

58
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:05,069
were telling globally that we're not
gonna do local files and groups I'll do

59
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:16,589
anything to the EMS is attraction of the
permissions to the city 700 securing the

60
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:29,889
crime

61
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:45,529
here we wanted to save the life you for
reading turns your Linux server into it

62
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,909
so if it's in the evil that means I can
connect to the system I can route

63
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:56,909
packets ooh I can use it as a router
uses a network address translation do

64
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:06,590
all the things we wanted to save a life
features in 447 redirects max in backlog

65
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,258
broadcast stuff here

66
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,400
cookies to make sure that you have that
there for Vendetta attacks and things

67
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,318
like that

68
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,349
GCC rappers are nice

69
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:30,159
basically walk connections you want to
have one quick so going back to the in

70
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,919
the quick thing to do the first thing on
installing the system is tonight house

71
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,649
just setting up the system and you want
to get it up and running is installed I

72
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:47,550
just young Matt get installed in my
house what that will do is it install

73
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,040
monitoring system for your has to say

74
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,250
process that one strain too brief for
sitter tonight host file so here what

75
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,550
he's doing he's just saying hey I'm I'm
denying everything and then just

76
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:11,219
allowing cessation the night and then
denied house the program will actually

77
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:21,459
you put the passer it's forced to
actions by Peters is where the brute

78
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:27,459
force it is it's a picture coming into
and to deny house and then you have the

79
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,800
out you do have to travel problem

80
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,579
if you enter your password and too many
times it will block you so you can put

81
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:50,279
your IP addresses some basic security
process so this is AP tables so when one

82
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:56,470
thing he does here that these policies
for both inputs for it he doesn't have

83
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:34,790
except pink sheer better and so this
template because basically in the evils

84
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:42,300
of the basic stuff blocks incoming and
outgoing 2011 reason why you want to

85
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:51,910
block outgoing but why do you want to
block traffic leaving your server

86
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,680
data xfer leaving your system so we want
to prevent you know you want to limit

87
00:10:58,680 --> 00:13:46,000
what they have that system

88
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:01,650
server

89
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:11,920
Ronnie finds you know we leave structure
can be using that makes sure that the

90
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:20,410
disabled services that we know

91
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:32,129
systems are not going to use and the one
thing I recommend doing is if you can

92
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:38,459
limit your SSH connections from known
sources so just provide a list of places

93
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,939
you know you're going to connect from
you as a server and if you don't if you

94
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:45,399
can't do that

95
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,129
bunch of different places and starting
tonight host or sale of any security

96
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:58,399
option there is nothing you want to say
it was you want to save the TCP you

97
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,839
don't want your system getting an IP
address has its ways especially with the

98
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:13,329
shell-shocked vulnerability actually
gaining access system so you know set

99
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:32,609
static IP address is removed the DHCP
servers addresses and said he address

100
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:44,200
protection by Colonel X 601 make sure it
was our place in randomized binary table

101
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:54,380
just the most difficult so one thing
that we need to stop doing when the

102
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,500
stuff turning up at St Lenox talked
about this a little more so anytime you

103
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,470
have an issue that the set and sources
07 first one you can kind of player

104
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:18,019
didn't see you having a problem with my
ex miss you are you can use it to talk

105
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,040
about it more later

106
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,560
do you take your SELinux is she is so
you're saying okay so the problems that

107
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,109
are having they're not gonna make a
policy that traditionally you trying to

108
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,190
do something is probably already in
place that you can able to do what you

109
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,690
want to do it that system so moving
forward to securing a cessation of his

110
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:50,199
first goal to limit users access to my
idle timeout so this is important

111
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,939
because someone's got to factor in your
system and using a cessation backdoor

112
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:06,329
times out so there's time for them to do
something they can't just say it will

113
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:14,069
ruin so you have a Linux system
privileged user in the nest

114
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,540
Subaru centrist parties are usually in
set it up with a root user name password

115
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,849
since you do that you go into the system

116
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:30,699
else to do and then disabled and then
enable the wheel

117
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,080
group B I see two point and you can just
logging on privileged users and still do

118
00:17:38,080 --> 00:18:06,658
route ministration that's helped her
move to

119
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:18,489
so make sure that patch user is easy you
know Magan then we will make sure that

120
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:22,429
the file free songs are set correctly so
this is a scan the basic things that

121
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:27,399
should be set by default that could
change it can go through and change them

122
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:34,418
bags so right here this is a security
settings if you were to wipe out your

123
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:40,840
patch this is the most bare patches
configuration here we just have the

124
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,789
directory we have two options none right
now and then we just tell the directory

125
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:54,539
to all this does is host to trade
options directive we allow options

126
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:16,230
instead of everything

127
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:24,150
here is using these yet know why we just
one turn it off when I stopped using

128
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:30,530
Apache so no wonder you simply won't
turn those off and if you have to use

129
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:41,418
the owner matches so that only leaves
the money system is saying he's actually

130
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,070
user 2008 you the symlinks to seize
money lia sophia have a directory where

131
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:53,010
you don't have the images and one story
stuff there and we can tell us / images

132
00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:00,780
just go to this directory thing I
stopped using if we can stop using easy

133
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:09,100
access files for details on the site
here but not easy access files to our

134
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,309
overriding someone can get access the
file system writes the file system they

135
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,710
can write ac access files and
additionally eighty access files will

136
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,660
slow down your server so it's much
better to just have your to take inside

137
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,320
the Apache config consider using the AC
access how to do your Madre writer due

138
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:40,678
consideration changes over a directive
basically controls what date she access

139
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,910
files can do you just how to configure
and how to do things like that again he

140
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,470
told me to just turn it off

141
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,530
additionally and one thing you want to
do in the morning to reduce information

142
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,809
we get so you don't want to broadcast
people that were actually using Apache

143
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:03,360
so we wanted to use server signature
certificates reduction only set the

144
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,209
server name coming out

145
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:15,750
tokens and trace unit looks great so it
raises

146
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,940
protocol where I just basically see I'm
gonna send you a request and want you to

147
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,950
send back what I told you

148
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:32,220
that use for modifying the header doing
something with my request that you use

149
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,940
the trades community can say ok this is
what this is what I sent server

150
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,370
responded back with so you're not doing
the testing for not doing testing my

151
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:50,070
internet off so we can use the curl
command you can see I T saw we get all

152
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,929
the information I'm down blue and green
is better for me saying it's running

153
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,730
Apache is sent to us we get the time

154
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,960
kinds of stuff here

155
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,440
turning these freaking what we can
reduce your friends and then hear what

156
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,860
they call him and you can look at your
surfers

157
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:25,409
trend CEO display back to the user
distantly projectile type so if you have

158
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:32,660
a list of file types are you being
served by your web server ideally like

159
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,680
get files are done it's the end or
something like that we can create

160
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,500
rejects its file types you want to put
anything in the year like stocks ETFs or

161
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,360
anything that you know if you're not
serving it checked the file type that

162
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,360
way you can communicate how much
information we could just might be said

163
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:05,779
no you're not welcome this is the patchy
was toughest in the patty cakes here

164
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:30,799
so much he cared you actually have
modified the serious nature so here we

165
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,950
can do something fun like telling system
hey we're actually Microsoft I like

166
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,429
doing that because you know you look at
the head running away or Microsoft

167
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:51,789
technology again we go through so like
we did at the Linux operating system to

168
00:23:51,789 --> 00:24:01,289
go through and we eliminate needed
Apache modules that I got kind of a

169
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:08,639
critical one for not using WebDAV
because we have left out was that to be

170
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:15,099
the case here in out to you right to
system restore the system is turned that

171
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:22,678
off transmedia thing so we're doing
system hardening we also have to make

172
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,639
sure that we keep the application of
mind too so you make it changed go to

173
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:33,668
test it makes it an accusing that when
we're done with everything we want to go

174
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:38,690
to retest the application make sure that
the environment its running game is

175
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,299
running well you might also want to have
an unsecured system with the same

176
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,918
application intestacy ok

177
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,639
care that I'm seeing is actually from
the security not from the application

178
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:55,248
itself so one thing that you hear a lot
about what you're talking about hurting

179
00:24:55,249 --> 00:25:16,190
his shooting and so this is kind of the
process he wanted to try something

180
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,500
bad

181
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:24,850
making sure the directory with copy over
all the files it needs change root root

182
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:32,459
directory to his true / run then Bosch
everything's great zest race you to

183
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:40,320
identify potential problems this year so
one thing that they talk about how you

184
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,590
should should root Apache right here's
all the files there is a need to do the

185
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,889
trip at she tryna complicated lots of
stuff

186
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,140
additionally I hope I don't believe in
shootin anymore I think that's kind of a

187
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,590
kind of protecting an operating system I
think it's a little bit more work then

188
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,470
you're probably get this is distantly
there's been a ton of research done on

189
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,480
breaking a shirt sales and so many
consider to secure but it's on this

190
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,010
thing is it's additionally our security
can add if you feel like you're up to it

191
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:25,430
is kind of an introductory guide on how
to do so we talked about Linux for Juana

192
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,720
Briones stop receiving yes he likes to
the surface coaches like nothing's

193
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,670
working I gotta get it where he you know
I decided to move on so instead of the

194
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:42,530
saving it was just figure out why is he
isn't working correctly and so I am

195
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,230
system are you really need to do to get
a patchy talking to them i sequels

196
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:55,200
database to SELinux just in the ago and
never connected TV network connectivity

197
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,450
to database and then we go through and
restore calm that would restore the

198
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,450
configuration so if you make changes to
the bar W W html directory resource

199
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:19,070
planning commissions go soon make its
management styles that correctly install

200
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,129
the policy Corey you to troubleshoot

201
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:37,030
and then you can start troubleshooting
tools to hear that you're looking for

202
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:44,480
specific Rd predefined SELinux policies
you want to run get cash now lists all

203
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,820
the predefined policies and if you
weren't in the trash or anything else

204
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,220
that might be a policy to an airline
ticket to go and so talking about it was

205
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,020
pretty cool

206
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,370
first to make sure that your policies
are up to date status too bad command

207
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:14,439
allows a guy here basically without the
show you here's all the things you're

208
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,140
trying to do in the audit log and here's
why it's still not too loudly ok so I

209
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:26,400
ran through a litany of problems I try
to do everything that I wanted to do and

210
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,160
he used to live in a lil policy out of
that and then you can take that causes

211
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,360
the things I want system do not apply it
that way you can still happen

212
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:44,860
protection is still do what you want to
do so it doesn't take it you always on

213
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:53,250
if you're talking about what security
talking about pls that this could go see

214
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,170
how you can get a result scientific

215
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:05,530
signed by a third party but one thing
that can be dismissed over a lot is so

216
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,780
take your Asian so you'll see a lot of
times it's also not configured properly

217
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:18,200
additionally now that the cells that we
want to be less likely to occur until

218
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,780
association with to set up here and this
is a secure setup passed this so perhaps

219
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,220
test so

220
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,240
you want to test yourself as a self
contained herein should be attached to

221
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,929
service you can go to si.com the runners
can you want to make sure that you don't

222
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:39,409
publish results especially public server
they are setting up for the first time

223
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:43,700
that way you can get to scan and it's
not published in case you've missed

224
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:53,659
something but these settings you should
get a bus pass for their they're just

225
00:29:53,659 --> 00:30:03,820
want to support Internet Explorer 6 kind
of insecure but what we have here at the

226
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:11,320
top of the head sets itself safer order
so what that does the service secure

227
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,408
site for that I can first to you can see
that our C four is at the end there so

228
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:24,020
you have to go all the way down her
before I will and then we can look at

229
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:34,280
your ass is consenting to sell or give
you can pronounce it was so seeing and

230
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,760
what protocols it's easy

231
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,600
additionally you always want to sales
associates to share system you wanna

232
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,280
make sure that if something breaks that
it breaks six years earlier I we don't

233
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,950
want us to offer security system is not
working correctly we tell it two blocks

234
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,390
and thing is getting something passed so
you're not using for dating don't run in

235
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:40,230
the tech

236
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:50,720
this is an example of the denial of
service attack my patchy so here you can

237
00:31:50,720 --> 00:32:04,809
kind of run since attacks temporary 652
demand and drop their IP address for 60

238
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:16,960
seconds after 20 count consultant for
since packets can be useful additional

239
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,330
so since lyndon since like that
basically destroyed it takes all the

240
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:28,659
open connections and send packet and
send him back to hack and simpson's in

241
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:36,370
doing so under attack like a distributed
denial-of-service attack attack you

242
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:50,870
probably need something more to take
care of someone to use taxes model kind

243
00:32:50,870 --> 00:33:00,520
of cool stuff to 400 he does attack or
someone's trying to use tractors or we

244
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:10,559
can simply say hey this is happening so
we set the notification email with the

245
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,280
module designed the settings here

246
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:23,418
page counts a fucking period to your
inbox for 10 seconds we have a

247
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:29,120
configuration here's a few more detail
what she's doing how to configure the

248
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,229
modern face of script from this link
here and it'll go through and blog

249
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:42,119
someone trained he does your web server
eg tables

250
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:50,218
and then we want to modify this file you
can actually run this command sets

251
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:59,619
settings here we can find you need us
time and keep alive

252
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:05,119
keeper cross to take your Asian limits
we want to consider that women in Saudi

253
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:14,009
she'll size the body request body the
headers

254
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:27,779
p.m. settings basically how she sparks
so if you can kind of signed to a

255
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:32,219
five-year security at you you want to
identify how much traffic you're going

256
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:39,248
through how many threads how many forks
you wanna do in the process this Mex

257
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:43,209
clients at any given time things like
that you want to go soon as you see here

258
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,749
in this you wanna do based on here

259
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:59,269
application and your traffic because you
have logged in the past there are places

260
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:05,609
you connect him to you can see what prop
popular places on the application you

261
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:10,089
can also see what before looking for
this not there are some of the text in

262
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:15,220
your website my PSP my admin or work as
a bunch of other stuff as you can see a

263
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,180
bunch of weird requests for things that
don't exist on your system that you

264
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,578
shouldn't be there so that you can go to
block this IP address because it's not

265
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:31,230
using my application to he says he's
just trying to look for malicious ways

266
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:38,620
to you my application or do something to
a system

267
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:46,480
so who here has heard of web application
firewall how many of you have set up a

268
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:56,340
case of fire so much guarantees free
open-source firewall and is very

269
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,750
powerful and exploring a lot of its
features and today or just can't talk

270
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,470
about basic setup but I do recommend if
you have this free time goes to learn it

271
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:16,740
know a lot of help you you know really
secure application I'm actually quite

272
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,120
impressed with its capabilities and the
things you can do so on your web

273
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,779
application on the VN got much security
and stuff

274
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:36,150
security modules greater directly to the
rules and they tell us where the rules

275
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,800
are and then them up the rules for you
to download a bunch of rules of the

276
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,420
house fire laps to the configuration and
so here's the important part is over

277
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:55,160
gonna tell you what this means whether
application firewall is blocking and if

278
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,770
there's no list traffic it's gonna sit
in back of 40 sorry that's how you know

279
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:24,910
it's working so

280
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:31,529
but you don't want to block traffic
where you gonna wanna do is turn it into

281
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:40,260
action mode only so you're insulting the
wealth cash in the detection and

282
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,390
protection mode you have to go through
the air lock and say ok this rule

283
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:49,000
actually apply this rule does it was
legitimate traffic from a customer that

284
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,470
traffic then once you are happy with
your happy everything's in place then

285
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:01,649
you wouldn't want to make sure that you
watch it to fail when you enable it so

286
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,290
that if someone does have an issue
because it does happen metrics and

287
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,509
there's of the season nothin on least it
looked like the check it will block user

288
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:15,110
guarantee that any time you have a
correction method you gonna catch your

289
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:22,080
customers more often than you gonna
catch so definitely spend some time on

290
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,120
March security it's a great tool highly
recommended any web application for

291
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,500
setting up thirty Apache system make
sure that you have it setup and

292
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,260
configured correctly and even if you
don't like it we don't you working

293
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,930
environment we don't want to block
anything put it into text you set up its

294
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,649
in detection mode and you have a
compromise you can go back to lock say

295
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,310
hey well we didn't block this attack we
definitely saw their signatures and

296
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,370
their attack meant that you can kind of
piece back together what happened and

297
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:05,580
doesn't better security architecture
alright did we did under the feet are

298
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:11,190
getting through this likely my sequels
is not a whole lot to do to secure it is

299
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,360
its China hidden so we're good to go

300
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:24,060
so securing peace in the TCI my file we
want to disable expose peacekeeper in

301
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,820
turn that off his wife but we don't tell
people are using PHP we have two da PC

302
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:44,160
extension you know change that to use
but my sister not exposing someone's

303
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,339
trying to attack is just a systemic
guess I'm going on to save all areas we

304
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,380
don't want to players to users if
there's something wrong with the

305
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,720
application we just want society crash
no errors we also want to loggers

306
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:07,029
overseeing here's the PC application we
will make sure that we don't need to do

307
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,600
so

308
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,029
attacker when they have your application
for file uploads gonna wanna know

309
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,390
malicious content on their back door
something so if we limit the amount of

310
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:29,490
data that they can transmit we can make
it more difficult for them to use your

311
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,879
application

312
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:43,510
maliciously so how you are open on a URL
include that is off by two white tees

313
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,480
off that this is one thing he doesn't
want to check on your web server because

314
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,520
if that's enabled the tanker can
remotely include peacefully scripts and

315
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,790
execute the script from you sir that
something you definitely want to check

316
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:05,730
on a compromise system menu system is to
make sure that turned off

317
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:12,079
size and safety equipment on

318
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:37,049
application use proper transportation
which makes them I see

319
00:41:37,049 --> 00:42:20,670
turn do its just a few weeks ago

320
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:37,140
civil sanctions other show those trying
to upload directory we want to do this

321
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,750
because we only want to the store and
rectory in such a place we can look for

322
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:49,920
potential this is scripts are nothing
like we wanted for everything we wanted

323
00:42:49,920 --> 00:44:32,829
to save this plane that the user fees

324
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:39,609
developer doesn't have to worry about
that means that the cookie information

325
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:47,459
only as a cell connections and won't be
sent out connections

326
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:53,149
correctly if you don't set to be secure
even when are you going to other sites

327
00:44:53,150 --> 00:45:06,960
they can still

328
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:34,540
texas won any money for this is a list
of some dangerous one thing you can do

329
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:44,060
the cases go through and grab space I R
star for the name and see if they're

330
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:51,310
being used if you're not using you see
him so in there just turned that off how

331
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:57,430
many times have you ever really his feet
so anything other than just setting so

332
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:02,899
this is this is one of those things that
can be customized don't just take this

333
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,119
copy and paste and say I'm good to go
because you might need some of these

334
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,800
functions that some of the things that
you don't wanna make you act and she'll

335
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,990
expect for not doing any command line
stuff application doesn't have to have

336
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:28,740
access to the show you some turmoil can
be very dangerous

337
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:38,319
so you can check for missions on money
diffuse philosophy to peaceful space /

338
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,590
you know give you a list of all the
modules are installed modules are

339
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:48,560
installed in that CPT and then you can
just had a dream even to the same here

340
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,029
I'm not using sequel go ahead and
disable it additionally there's a cool

341
00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:02,740
project that looking as PCI DSS I think
if you're using ModSecurity probably

342
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,660
don't need these kind of something the
players because it has a bunch of

343
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:14,520
signatures and other things that are
specific to teach me the architects PC

344
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:29,710
configuration questions so it's my SI
core system should allow account through

345
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:37,060
texas user table so for every
application we have and I might have a

346
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,660
user name and password for that user
name and password please to have

347
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,520
permissions are specific to that
location and most the time you're gonna

348
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,910
need it selects and search and update

349
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,180
applications really shouldn't be using
the lead to writing whether the occasion

350
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:02,720
you shouldn't be using the computer says
things Miami just market is hittin you

351
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,359
have an application that you know your
neighborhood but if you're running

352
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,400
applications it's try and not use to get
things get out they have it using the

353
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:24,359
dangers that injection gets hijacked
because they can manipulate it most of

354
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,890
the time we have huge hard drives

355
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,920
elections not recent

356
00:48:29,920 --> 00:49:32,359
at least something that probably don't
wanna

357
00:49:32,359 --> 00:50:02,308
basically just don't do that I see
question trust imitated by users

358
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:09,349
applications results and never run my
secrets roots never do that because of

359
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:16,239
my CEO gets compromised has filed right
features accessed your system password

360
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:26,269
file links tootsie rolls use IP
addresses instead of hostnames because

361
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:33,999
he takes the NHS trusts you really trust
your DNS graph emissions just use the ip

362
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:42,078
address password from the command line
so when you're making this tape your

363
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,640
password which committed to saving the
mighty history so this is kinda and has

364
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,319
touched a utility you can use to encrypt
your my seat will traffic so if you have

365
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,499
a web application server on one system
and how much he will survive another

366
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:04,308
system can stand at best on as town of
greatness the cell connection between

367
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:10,910
application server and database server
and this will do is meant to be sniffing

368
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,848
your service he compromised accounts
there and sniff out the traffic is

369
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:20,769
happening up the web server database
server prevents other types of

370
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:27,459
connections on the tax have to have a
valid certificate to connect the basic

371
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,059
configuration disabled too important to
research using stils

372
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:38,559
we challenge to listen to you incoming
clicks and some local port 3306 weary

373
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,949
route 32 years 6 to 10 2013 3:07

374
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:52,199
and then this AM I C Costa Rican say we
have to sell it if the kids are you

375
00:51:52,199 --> 00:52:01,680
saying that sell version 32 using kill s
ok any investigation 93307 is going to

376
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:08,058
connect 3306 this way our application
whether she doesn't have to know where

377
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:14,079
the configuration my secret that they
have no idea this is a situation

378
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:27,160
discussed herein connects so when you're
running a Guest Pass alert to leap test

379
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:39,649
database passwords on the system and
remove all the user system used to

380
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:53,529
remove the users of my pastors and my
sequel 6000 that junk for you listening

381
00:52:53,529 --> 00:53:01,170
to my night on the final touches are
using it that way to guarantee that's

382
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:07,689
not gonna be exposed to the network
cable box I'll show that if someone runs

383
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:12,949
malicious queries you can go back and
look at see what happens we want to

384
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:20,900
disable local in sales so what that does
is a nice equal rights to files and

385
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,710
files

386
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:36,280
we set permissions we have selected the
update the database of privileges I can

387
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:44,619
see what privileges that user has we can
revoke templates if you want to see what

388
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:53,470
information is going by in clear text
here at six and just run into streams

389
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:59,939
gotta be careful about that can be
exploited to those hand give you the

390
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,770
traffic going in between your webserver

391
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:16,200
additionally I knew about the my secret
histories what's happening on your

392
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,879
system there's usually a ton of passes
in there to granting passers printing

393
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:28,940
privileges you want it clear that and if
you're not really using it just so you

394
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:36,300
know we're going deaf notes on my
bicycle history's mysteries turning in

395
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:46,580
the stuff that pretty much covers it

396
00:54:46,580 --> 00:55:03,610
that's kind of like you

397
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:09,540
complicated topic that's something you
should be doing so that should be

398
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:15,500
crippling their day then storing
encrypted you have to do the things turn

399
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,650
encrypted you should see what I do for
my stuff is I have a key so I'm using

400
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:26,190
open at the cell libraries and peaceful
I have a public web surfers have the

401
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:33,590
public and private keys stored somewhere
else so when I have to come in the crypt

402
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,020
it comes in public-key encryption and
stored in database encrypted and then

403
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:44,520
text file and then when I need that day
trip to his credit keep it iced or

404
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,690
someone else and so i have a web
application interface well put that

405
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:56,780
credit and store the memory and then go
soon decrypt the data you can also click

406
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:04,960
on the file system to lose performance
of that you want to encrypt your data if

407
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,420
you have sensitive data like social
security numbers credit card data should

408
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,770
be encrypting it you should be using a
public key infrastructure not using its

409
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:20,009
metric infrastructure so if you have you
know if you have to keep you don't want

410
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:27,380
to be able to your webserver shouldn't
be able to decrypt data and web surfers

411
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:33,510
at some point will be a compromise that
that's the question is there something

412
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:41,960
specific

413
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:54,310
it is rooted in st. country 2015 is the
basic install go through these things in

414
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:54,580
place
