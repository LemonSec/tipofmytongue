1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
here there's a lot of open space like in
those airplanes that you feel free to

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,150
text kind of lay down take a nap it's
the perfect 2 o'clock slot and

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,609
compliance is in the name of the
presentation it's conducive for nap

4
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:25,330
taking I imagine that you guys are here
for one reason or another even if it's a

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:37,110
it's gave vendor tables or just where no
one else would be but I hope that there

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,460
will be content that you guys can take
away from this talk about objective of

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,840
this discussion and I say discussion I
mean that I'll be taking questions

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,820
between an uncomfortable with that if
you guys want to raise your hand during

9
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,600
if I can't see you guys there is light
shining in my eyes and just kind of fell

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:05,630
out and try to try to field questions as
best they can but just wanted to

11
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,899
understand well I guess I'll introduce
myself my first time presenting here at

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,340
st. Khan and yeah it's exciting

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,470
nerve-wracking have never presented in
front of the large room before

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:32,660
and we'll see how that goes but when I
worked at work front and Compliance

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,520
Manager is managed by title I don't
manage any people but managed the

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:49,600
compliance processes of policy in fact I
really geeked out about reports I can't

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,890
get enough in my spare time for some
really fine reading check out Amazon's

18
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,150
you learn absolutely nothing about their
environment that's that's like the

19
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:09,190
standard it's perfect but in all reality
I do I do enjoy a passion for compliance

20
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,700
have a passion for the framework that
people come up with and seemed to

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,420
continue inventing in order to get one
thing or another and make more money

22
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,890
from my background I worked in Novell
that was kind of my first introduction

23
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,910
of technology when I graduated from
Brigham Young University I went to work

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,750
for their now called and they're one of
what are known as the big four

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:46,860
accounting firms but did you I T audits
provide people soccer for its that's

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,209
what I did all the time

27
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,180
60 70 hours a week was just renting out
these reports are they hold a special

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,570
place in my heart I do I think it's
important to post this disclaimer

29
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,280
compliance is not security and I don't
want anyone to leave here thinking that

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,730
because they put in place any kind of
compliance measures frameworks that

31
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,369
they're secure or not they can help
guide

32
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,250
news they can help instruct certainly
management and customers more

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,220
importantly of the security measures
that you're following but it doesn't

34
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,260
surprise doesn't dictate security and
security actually doesn't dictate

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:40,578
compliance item in this presentation I
really do want it to be a little bit

36
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,829
less formal I wanted to be more of a
discussion I'm gonna be following some

37
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,650
very specific steps on how to present
and so from my book how to present

38
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,019
buyout of Wingate I've got a couple of
rules you really need to move your hands

39
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:03,599
a lot so you'll be seeing a lot of this
appear on the podium tons of memes and

40
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,858
that's just a little bit about knowing
your audience you know I mean

41
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:14,120
conferences is full of memes in addition
you need to repeat yourself a lot just

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,739
to use words even in the same sentence
and talk down to the audience of time

43
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:27,150
really helps with that so being able to
really just kind of inform you all how

44
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,549
things work

45
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:36,729
definitions that things are you guys
could be googling I think that hopefully

46
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,210
and hopefully see some of that
throughout the presentation as well

47
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,049
including yourself

48
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:50,120
credibility is key when presenting its
partisan agenda we're gonna be doing

49
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,080
what is right so the conversations about
managing compliance in the Devils

50
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,500
environment so we want to see

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,370
we want to try to understand what
devices they try to understand the

52
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:12,460
question mark I think we all know why
that's that is a question mark but the

53
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,469
problem statement we're gonna talk about
compliance criteria we're gonna be

54
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,600
addressing here in this in this
conversation and then talk about deficit

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,960
controls will get into some
brainstorming essentially what are the

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
challenges of DevOps and what can you
put in place what can you be considering

57
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:37,630
what kind of controls you put in place
to help developers from rolling code

58
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,040
into production

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:50,790
developing in production and then I'll
have a formal Q&A the end but again

60
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,180
asked questions throughout raise your
hand and make sure they get them so what

61
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,630
is it really it really does feel this
way you keep using that word means what

62
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:11,020
you think it means what does it right so
many organizations are take making us

63
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:18,340
here today because they feel that it
will mean quicker release customer will

64
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,010
be happier to have features faster right
so this rapid release really drives

65
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,110
organization to research and implement
some form of death and development

66
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,610
operations are taking the operations of
people to keep the wheels on and

67
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,620
combining those roles responsibilities
with people that code the applications

68
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:47,850
that work on top of those systems more
collaborative that can that can seem

69
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:55,240
really attractive also in hand in hand
with that rapid release continued

70
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,560
employment because they're moving today
it's always rolling code right always

71
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,640
introducing new features and and
customers responded that the honest with

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,750
you the user the end user response that
rapid release is

73
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:18,270
a benefit of device that people tend to
latch onto deeper in the cloud right we

74
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:26,260
can reduce costs just put everything in
Amazon and it's a lot cheaper mention

75
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,550
rapid release rapid release like getting
hitters out there

76
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:40,860
repeating yourself in a presentation on
my keys and then I can google it for you

77
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:50,890
turns out it you did not even googling
what is David's just DevOps the top half

78
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:57,620
of the post-war what is Devin answering
it but also asking genuinely what in the

79
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:05,260
world is now you know now you know what
devices you have the reality is that if

80
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,770
your organization and by raising hands
are you in an organization that we're

81
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:24,409
planning on moving today so this year
already into whatever it says there are

82
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:33,010
so many different flavors and no one no
one goes old emma but in reality its

83
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:45,020
challenges and so every organization has
to tailor their approach and

84
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:53,730
problem really what we want to cover a
shift can introduce risk to the business

85
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,760
and its data and I didn't spell check
spelling errors just blame the editor

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,770
they probably missed it this isn't a
unique problem

87
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:14,630
anyone had ever dealt with risk
compliance evaluating risk in an

88
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,710
organization knows that if you're
introducing anything new

89
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:27,070
it's going to introduce risk there are
challenges there can holes opened up in

90
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,310
your systems because of these new
processes systems new organizational

91
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,489
structure so that the real problem if we
distill it down is that this shift will

92
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,730
introduce our Canon risk as with any
organization shift then there are

93
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,290
certain process is it appropriate risk
the city we're talking about managing

94
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,290
compliance the perspective that I'm
going to be coming at this from is

95
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,219
security compliance and there are a
variety of reports I didn't include them

96
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,790
anywhere in the side because everyone
has their own requirements the

97
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:11,120
organization where their customers so we
could be talking about HIPAA PCI my

98
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,040
personal favorite reports one two and
three

99
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,599
ISO 27001 and actual certification right
even if you guys are dealing with

100
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:42,600
government entities and you and i SMS
right so logical access physical access

101
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,889
and other I T operations at home in
that's why that's why those bullets and

102
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,149
you can see a lot of things missing from
that and if any of you ever interacted

103
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,430
with an auditor and I was an auditor and
so I feel like it's Pete someone tells

104
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,899
you they interacted with an auditor they
have so you can lead an auditor down

105
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,889
whatever path you choose almost but they
will latch on to certain things that

106
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,329
they see or find it may not have
anything to do with your organization

107
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:17,209
but all the sudden they thought that
seems important to me and it falls under

108
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,029
one of my categories and I need to
follow up with it but it when the

109
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:27,139
reality of things it doesn't flood risk
urination or or or otherwise but change

110
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,779
management large black this physical
access and other I T operations such as

111
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:38,360
disaster recovery monitoring network
security those are gonna be the areas

112
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,670
where they're gonna focus and where we
need to be aware for making a shift or

113
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:54,579
have me to ship them to keep those
controls in place the reality that

114
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,050
that's the problem the reality is that
it isn't a new concept isn't new

115
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,439
combining developers with giving
developers the responsibility of

116
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:09,400
top-to-bottom control system right now I
think back to

117
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:16,620
accompanied my dad worked for and they
would just basically hand out some

118
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,360
vendor came and told us this new tool
and then they would he would hand it off

119
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:32,670
to the idea the idea will maintain that
system was the tech support he was the

120
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,250
one pushing patches and updating the
system may not have been the developing

121
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,240
the company developing kirby's certainly
had some of those change management

122
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:52,500
responsibilities patching change
management so there's a new rewards the

123
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,690
DevOps is a unique from any other kind
of fancy trendy organization structure

124
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:08,510
and in the end wrist and evaluating
those risks measuring the communication

125
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,030
isn't new

126
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:18,610
so then it's really boiling down those
aspects of Debye challenge the controls

127
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,480
that we have in place so as we go
through the rest of this presentation

128
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,730
and discussion I want you to think about
what is the risk that we present some of

129
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,450
the challenges of the area's control
areas the criteria to security about

130
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,410
what is the risk what the rest of my
organization will talk to Erica Lee

131
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,510
about what that could be

132
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,240
think about what is the risk is this is
this something that would matter to me

133
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,020
that would matter to my company
customers that would matter to

134
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,260
executives in my company

135
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:03,510
and to making an adjustment any kind of
reorg is looking for you can you can

136
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:09,090
identify similar processes overlap those
are your auditor help them understand

137
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,490
that they're the same look we we we do
steps ab&c in both of these processes

138
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,210
let's just look at them as a simple
process and you're gonna win reduced man

139
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:29,530
hours managers finally we do need to
talk about what others are looking for

140
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:37,240
you have interacted with auditors and
some may not have dealt with auditors

141
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:45,190
very much but I am NOT lying on its
themes that may or may not have any

142
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,020
consequence of your organization so what
I want to talk about in this is gonna be

143
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,540
aligned with the trust services
principles so if you've heard of the

144
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:00,969
sock to it is a control framework that
is based on trust services principles

145
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,830
their status by the ACPA it's a
framework that's definitely more

146
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,050
credible carries much more right here in
the USA and it doesn't actually but it's

147
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,979
growing and it's developed rapidly on
the coast

148
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,560
2012 everyone was asking for one and now
we're seeing here in Utah now and saying

149
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,680
that a lot of our customers are becoming
aware of sock to what's included in it

150
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,219
why it's different than a stock one and
why that might be important to them I

151
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,930
didn't choose ISO 27001 I didn't use
federal and just because their control

152
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,319
frameworks are they tend to be a little
more redundant and it has its purpose

153
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,580
but their large control frameworks that
ramped asthma if you choose a medium

154
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:57,080
risk your going to be looking at over
300 controls and you can implement a

155
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,660
sock to any organization with less than
just to give kind of an idea

156
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,300
requirements so that is something that
your organization has to follow make

157
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,240
sure you get a consultant or make sure
you understand what is needed

158
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,060
they're gonna be pointing you didn't
miss all the time saying you have to be

159
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,520
doing seven past you have to be smashing
those hard drives and I built this

160
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,949
conversation of comic control criteria
on sock to the controls that they are

161
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,460
then recommending a testing on to
provide this site to report have to do

162
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,540
with these topics the first is
organization and management so when when

163
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,300
an auditor is evaluating a company
outing for security right the trust of

164
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,400
his principles include other criteria
that aren't just security but we're

165
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,740
right now we're talking about security
organization management they want to

166
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,520
know that it's a top-down approach to
security and they want to know that it's

167
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,180
the executives are communicating these
requirements that they have strong

168
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,910
passwords that they're saying yes
encrypt your heart rates because we care

169
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:17,560
about the data that were protecting so
we see that entity level controls or

170
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,599
entity level safeguards and these are
overarching principles in your

171
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,839
organization does your a chart do
background checks and we don't think of

172
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,620
that as security per se but in the
compliance world if you're if an auditor

173
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,489
is evaluating our customer is there
representing us if they're evaluating

174
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,720
Organization for Security they have the
right people

175
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,860
coding that you have the right people
that have access to the custard they're

176
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,770
they're sensitive information so they
want to know are you doing background

177
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,370
checks how often are you doing security
training annually or or have whatever

178
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,919
frequency right and what all does that
include organizational management is the

179
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:06,180
first criteria in security communication
so the facts are not only having those

180
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,850
of overarching securities

181
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,889
but also that you can be killing them
internally your employees understand any

182
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,360
time they know where they stand in this
whole machine of protecting information

183
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,889
right they can have access to all of the
policies that they would need to have to

184
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,350
do their job that customers would
understand also that you've communicated

185
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:37,080
customers what the boundaries of your
system are you know that you have Terms

186
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,668
of Use

187
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,820
you have some kind of NDA in place that
you're reviewing those things are

188
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,908
communicated if you have an incident how
is that how you write so communication

189
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,850
is the second criteria the next couple
risk management controls this one is my

190
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:06,389
absolute favorite and are you are you
presenting that to management are you

191
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,940
able to communicate risk down so that's
often we find the risk we find them on

192
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,309
the low level we find that someone has
read access our back door into an

193
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:20,470
application but once we do the risk
assessment we find yeah we've got this

194
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,220
one billion communicate that are we
helping the organization get better

195
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,740
are using that risk assessment to
implement actual security and controls

196
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,040
controls are just the way of helping to
enforce its just a way of measuring

197
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,930
for your users shouldn't be doing it
gives you a chance to check to make sure

198
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,140
see where you're at

199
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,920
control is just that it's just a
necessary evil in this whole compliance

200
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:59,750
machine but they definitely result from
the risk assessment overall control

201
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,930
might be a way of mitigating along with
his hand in hand is monitoring those

202
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,130
controls putting them in place doesn't
do a whole lot unless you monitor and

203
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:35,910
enforce yeah

204
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:42,020
question so the question was it you have
some control these damaging organization

205
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,540
and correct me if I get this wrong but
if you establish some criteria you want

206
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,430
your employees to follow this and then
you adopt a third-party solution some

207
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,920
kind of South provider maybe your vendor
what can be done to ensure that your

208
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,100
enforcing that for those vendors as well
right is that so depending on the

209
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,969
framework that you follow your order me
also

210
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,790
and you or your use of that software
good example is ATP lot of organizations

211
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:17,170
using ADP payroll often becomes in
school because of the amount of money

212
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:25,350
that's coursing through my veins and so
and Auditor we'll ask you is your

213
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,669
position have you evaluated ATP are you
following your own policy

214
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,810
ATP provide you the opportunity to set
your own passwords in the application

215
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:46,690
and then they're gonna include that wrap
that up into the audit and not really

216
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,430
would only be in scope it it's
financially significant doesn't mean

217
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,100
it's not a best practice sales forces
another that may be a better example

218
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,500
right a lot of sensitive data or
customer data goes for Salesforce and in

219
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,460
your organization do you know are you
aware of the password settings on the

220
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:17,790
sales force in question you should be
asking yourself if you have a password

221
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,120
policy should you not then hold your
vendors to a similar policy front we

222
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,179
develop software within the tool itself
we allow customers to set those

223
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,990
parameters they could set a password
policy so it seems easy enough to just

224
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:37,200
kind of wash your hands and say it makes
you strong possibility that you could

225
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,270
set it up everyone and a lot of vendors

226
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,150
that way you'll find the majority of
those solutions that way but yet as a

227
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,270
compliance organization then you
certainly want to establish a vendor

228
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,830
review process and we're going to talk
about that but yeah so that you can no

229
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:07,129
physical access this is kinda standard
across the board it's something that we

230
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,930
often take for granted I really I really
do believe social engineering is the way

231
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,880
into an organization just by the people
and this is the gate right so protecting

232
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,420
the logical access of systems and the
physical access of your facilities and

233
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:31,520
resources is absolutely key to get in on
that it's easy for them to do your gonna

234
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,520
invite into your company at some point
of a walk through the front door they'll

235
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,010
be looking around like no one knowing
look now from IIT right so as long as

236
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:47,270
you don't have to check but as long as
no one's coming not just anyone is

237
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,710
coming in taking up a laptop but along
with logical physical access you can

238
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:01,570
consider increasing devices right
protecting those resources assets and

239
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:14,000
logical access a lot of times we wanted
to think about the four systems and may

240
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,610
be important and auditors can look at
that they may start asking questions

241
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,100
about where we noticed that you gave us
a password

242
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,129
yes the users we understand that we've
gone through there are you VA's this all

243
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,910
appropriate what about these system
accounts you know anything about the

244
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,790
system accounts

245
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,409
and give them an opportunity to dig
deeper

246
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,630
even though it may not matter this could
be some API into your payroll systems

247
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:48,080
employees something necessary they made
their diving down this whole so

248
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,530
understanding not only user access and
password system accounts and how their

249
00:24:53,530 --> 00:25:08,200
access yeah

250
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:16,929
fantastic question and its slide so we
were gonna will tackle that the question

251
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,630
was about that

252
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,269
access list tends to grow in a divisive
and what are some of the things we can

253
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:33,340
do about that will operate in this can
be kind of a blanket at times but

254
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,000
supporting systems a composer centrist
information security so are you catching

255
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:51,380
your systems do you have appropriate
place that something that I really think

256
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:59,250
backups security right we're still
talking about common security criteria

257
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,389
for an auditor

258
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:04,519
think about backup says something that
we now have responsibility for his

259
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:11,250
passion right back up protected if we
say we're gonna rest are equipped their

260
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,630
backup restore backups were they being
stored overdoing tape when we drive that

261
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,059
tape the tape storage facility who's
going with that vehicle ER wait times a

262
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,029
day are we doing it right we have the
proper texto we absolutely should be

263
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:30,190
considering backup when we're looking at
the security of our persistence of our

264
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,529
data of our environment

265
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:37,139
finally change management and other
subjects I'm really passionate about

266
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:44,240
along with risk management change when
we can break everything right here

267
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:56,310
lingers really and then hitting enter
France right so cloud applications

268
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:03,899
in the inexperienced innovation in a
DevOps environment even more so how you

269
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,170
manage change management is going to be
there are some additional control of the

270
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:16,160
part of the sock sock to framework so
you can elect to also have another test

271
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,080
for availability controls
confidentiality availability right

272
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,149
especially just a solution this can be
this is generally the number two doing

273
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,220
the stock to their usually doing the
concrete you have to do

274
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:35,450
security and availability customer care
escalates in place so why not give them

275
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,320
an idea of that time the systems that
are there to support that help them be

276
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,389
comfortable they're asking for it
because we don't have to give them

277
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,240
anything

278
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,940
confidentiality protecting that
information data integrity so the

279
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,330
accuracy of that information

280
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,199
inputs and outputs you're measuring them
to make sure that there are on par and

281
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:05,410
finally privacy is hardly ever adopted
surprise in the United States we really

282
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,570
don't like it we don't like talking
about it i mean we would love to see we

283
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,870
don't care about it but we love it and
it's not really a conversation we found

284
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:22,389
this out I guess we've always known
right but safe harbor is is an agreement

285
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,870
that the EU had with the USS in export
and import data they wanted to make sure

286
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,280
that they are you citizens that their
information is secure protected not

287
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,540
being looked at by anyone that shouldn't
be anyone other than the aggrieved party

288
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,280
so we had safe harbor in place as we
know a student who came to Santa Clara

289
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,250
University filed a class-action suit
filed the suit against Facebook

290
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:55,960
ruling was from that that safe harbor is
no longer in effect we can't use safe

291
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,860
harbor as a protection just got this
kind of beside this discussion but make

292
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,879
sure that your organization can be
getting those questions what are you

293
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:20,760
doing with Article 28 article 29 that
contract extension with a blanket and we

294
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:28,960
need to have one-to-one if they have a
breach of course that's what that

295
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,520
privacy privacy has to be concerned
about whether we test-fired I would

296
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:42,580
encourage you to right now the AICPA is
rewriting their privacy criteria so they

297
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:51,399
they issued criterion 2012 for all of
the other controls except privacy 2012

298
00:29:51,400 --> 00:30:02,910
first update since 2007 and 2012 well
we're ready with everything else we need

299
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:08,880
to be considering there's only one cover
all so when we look at these frameworks

300
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,340
we look at solutions there's really only
one cover all and that is Lorenzo Cain

301
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,879
the center fielder for the Kansas City
Royals will cover everything everything

302
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:29,210
else we need to be looking at as we
can't have a blender there's no blanket

303
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,470
compliance report there's no blanket
solution and security right we can't

304
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:40,050
just got a firewall so we're seeing
right only Lorenzo Cain can cover

305
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:50,270
everything and there's only one of them
is busy so let's let's dive into each of

306
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,080
these topics

307
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,559
let's put them in the context of DevOps
and let's brainstorm some of the things

308
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,428
we need to be considering what what
could be a solution to the potential

309
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:04,110
challenges that are introduced in the
device environment so organization and

310
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:12,219
management and I don't know how big is
that people not sure about collaboration

311
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:21,130
or just pops losing responsibilities
right so organization and management in

312
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:28,510
this year in a shift from 972 DevOps not
apply to start of right at the start but

313
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:36,289
a shift to delve who are you reporting
to you what does the organization now

314
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:43,779
see as requirements and compliance and
even security can result in merged

315
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:49,440
technical leadership roles you may find
that you no longer have an advocate

316
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,309
directly right or or they don't speak
your language

317
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:58,549
the people that you now have to talk to
about compliance requirements they may

318
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:08,149
or may not see value in it definitely be
a challenge as a direct result from that

319
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:15,090
if they don't see value there may not be
budget for it I really appreciated the

320
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:26,360
keynote that was given the ISO from
University of Utah you mentioned that as

321
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,059
far as priorities we need to be ready to
communicate management we need to be

322
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,918
ready to fight for those budgets we need
to have the relationships developed

323
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:37,700
right

324
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,789
and I think that we should consider that
what what can be done in order to

325
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,299
communicate those risk management and
process owners manager doesn't manager

326
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,500
doesn't speak your language translator

327
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,769
charged I think that's really Menteri

328
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,799
we may think that but it's it's
certainly an ability it certainly

329
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,908
provides us an opportunity to learn that
provides an opportunity under standard

330
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:10,649
the new business card at so just as an
example

331
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:15,320
graphs-n-charts right here's percentage
of budget that you receive for the

332
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,510
approved versus the hours that you spend
on LinkedIn per day

333
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,309
you know so if you have let's say
hundreds in your budget you may not

334
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:29,039
spend 90% you see it goes up but tell us
a little bit like five hours a day if

335
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,059
you're getting the budget then there's
no point you're doing something wrong so

336
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:41,529
why even though that's just my attention
from the data the data it's science I

337
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:51,990
hope no one can be super valuable so
along with maps in your risk assessment

338
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,419
intelligence behind it

339
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:02,860
likelihood understanding where you're at
risk senior visually can help you'll be

340
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:11,868
surprised you will find benefits from
running a risk analysis may be higher

341
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:17,609
risk of reach I don't know

342
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:27,009
graphics their license I don't know they
are diagrams are reports right

343
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:33,270
presenting the management what our
security inventory is what do we have in

344
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:40,989
place the chart presented yesterday that
he know that was again it seems really

345
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:46,020
rudimentary but from the ground up you
know what our foundation what tools do

346
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,500
we have in place to address the

347
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,780
are known risk categories and they keep
calm and do a risk assessment and really

348
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,070
own it really dive in

349
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,500
you should not be if your security
professional you shouldn't be the only

350
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,350
person involved in compliance
professional you shouldn't be the only

351
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:10,100
person involved in risk assessment the
audience for your understanding

352
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,660
input from different parties actually in
the new organization we're in a new

353
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,970
organization structure

354
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,390
communication responsibilities then
related to communication these are

355
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,549
critical to both idea development and so
this is the reality the implementation

356
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:34,940
made push for a common process right so
if I'm a developer and I've got a

357
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,600
changing data center locations were also
rolling out these new features why not

358
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,900
do that in one class so instead of
having rpms just communicate new

359
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,250
features and then having I T operations
communicating infrastructure changes

360
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:56,980
they made one emerge this process is Nov
out use only challenge or one of the few

361
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,020
challenges to that

362
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,090
roles responsibilities related to these
may not be defined so if the business

363
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,870
that has an expectation you have a
common process we don't let our

364
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:16,759
customers with man about these updates
we learned that my advice something to

365
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,160
consider understanding illustrate your
communication requirements good examples

366
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,920
incident management if an incident
occurs a security incident performance

367
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,880
incident whatever you're responsible for
an incident occurs what's your

368
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,490
communication plan that communicates
management make sure they understand

369
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:45,759
risk management controls pretend to know
everything about

370
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,000
man gene compliant in a diverse
environment but I will say that neither

371
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,410
DevOps for operations development more
operations risk they are not they are

372
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,720
not the end party does not stop there

373
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,109
you may not feel that way you know the
pressure maybe on you and your

374
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:10,760
organization to implement a to manage
that risk but you certainly don't own it

375
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:22,030
follow the dollar finance on the risk
and we need to educate customers about

376
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,600
what they can again expect that is our
responsibility were the ones that know

377
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:33,390
the technology that is set up the
systems that maintain them but it

378
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:42,410
doesn't mean that you can't advise
certainly specially if you are doing a

379
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,680
risk assessment then communicating as
risk becomes even more important than

380
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,250
risk management controls look again look
for common process and repeat myself

381
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,450
he's that again

382
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,620
accounting processes like change
management and operations process you

383
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,080
might see the change request comes in
it's approved right which needs to be

384
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,330
replaced

385
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:12,549
ticular take it out put anyone in right
down in development that can be a little

386
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,540
it can look a little longer but you need
to be ready to establish this common

387
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:28,910
processes an auditor can understand but
it doesn't mean that add additional work

388
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,649
you don't want to add additional
questions and so helping and I don't

389
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,510
understand these are common process
request comes in it needs to be

390
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,100
authorized and unauthorized request now
needs to be developed and tested once

391
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,200
tested appropriately when it passes this
test it is formally approved and then

392
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,299
another party or responsibility then
released

393
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,240
that code there is a concept that an
editor finds sacred and it is

394
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,279
segregation of duties fraud protection
so in this process of building in at

395
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,550
least response

396
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,580
responsibilities will be critical

397
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:13,390
shots this can be a large challenge
finding someone else that can authorise

398
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:21,210
or approve it and have sufficient
understanding to be able to prove they

399
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,910
know the lines of code that were changed
but it's something that I would

400
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:34,899
encourage anyone look for this kind of
process you don't you don't just need to

401
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,630
change tickets for coaching so if you're
in AWS need to make a new security group

402
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:50,740
or should have something for you as an
organization we want to be able to find

403
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,660
out what did we change what was
different yesterday how can we fix it

404
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,390
access management it's another example
an access request my cum in you have

405
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,330
different systems development you may be
managing their access to LDAP they don't

406
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:13,670
have control that will change monitoring
the monitoring of these controls

407
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,950
combining development operations again
they may not be considered one of the

408
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,919
big challenges here is if I giving
developers the responsibility or the

409
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,150
ability to start a service from the
ground up they throw together a system

410
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:37,330
on whatever platform how do I know that
it can be monitor 25 Nagios refined

411
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,299
using any other tool to manage to figure
asians

412
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,730
I need to observe those systems if they
can put anything together I lost control

413
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:53,670
there is no control of shifted over one
of the considerations

414
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:59,190
is developing and enforcing standards
standards regarding system requirements

415
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:07,059
parameters prevent holes in in scope of
the complaints so you know a gold

416
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:17,230
standard gold image critical in helping
to ensure that controls around monetary

417
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:34,970
systems right that's so effed I've had
experience initiative the next day we

418
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:40,259
had a request for a developer for access
to the navy's next day like somebody

419
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:54,040
died and they were asking for their
couch and I was breakfast but this is

420
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:01,910
that this can be the Devils intimidation
and is open things that presents

421
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,399
absolutely no challenges the
organization just open it make sure

422
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,290
there's a ticket and they'll be fine
that's not true

423
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:17,259
yes make sure they take you through with
the organization they need to be on

424
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,670
board they have to understand the risks
make sure you can communicate them

425
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:29,099
parties so it doesn't do any good to
just say no

426
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:40,200
have the conversation so from a
compliance perspective if you have a

427
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:50,118
ticket and track that arise it was
reviewed and approved by the appropriate

428
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,339
party the system owner

429
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:56,019
than actually and I would come in they
include in their sample that check it

430
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:00,799
off they would ask probably little
questions about that but if they really

431
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:05,160
wanted to dive into appropriateness of
the access that's where you need to have

432
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,848
that conversation he be prepared to say
yet what actually is responsible for the

433
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:15,660
performance of our application developer
but his role is performance of he needs

434
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,649
to be monitoring tables to see how long
queries are taking he's he needs out

435
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,049
that you know that being able to have
this conversation before opening those

436
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,979
access floodgates yeah working with them

437
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:34,410
outlining what your approach is going to
be outlining certainly the complaints

438
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,399
require they have to know that any time
this happens they're going to need to

439
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,900
take it may be right but understanding
your scope they are going to need to

440
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,650
have some record that this was approved
that we said yes they can have access to

441
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,349
customer data these are required

442
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:54,190
requirements that you want to hold as an
organization but you may have to hold

443
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:03,289
and then more complex than that than
just having the ticket the record is how

444
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:10,829
do you maintain that segregation a
developer can now write and roll their

445
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:18,460
code what mechanism do you put in place
to check that to make sure that we trust

446
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,180
our developers honestly we we we all
trust our developers that we all make

447
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,069
mistakes are setting up security
parameters are configurations or in

448
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:35,869
mistakes so what can we do to make sure
that doesn't impact the customer

449
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:41,940
checking we put in your review is a lot
of large organizations and I have an

450
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,349
interesting their DevOps change
management and logical access to have

451
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:48,290
peer review in place

452
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:54,240
and so while yes we say a developer has
access to roll code they're gonna be

453
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,040
triggering that there is there is a
mandatory logical review that happens

454
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,420
that goes from one of their peers who
may have the same responsibilities right

455
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,370
but in that case they are not the
developer rolling code and developing

456
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:12,500
there there are ways to manage that
logical access and if there is any more

457
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,820
questions about that

458
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:21,700
happy to those operation certainly a
challenge and endeavour each team on to

459
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,270
manage their own sister talked about
they get to determine how to set that up

460
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:30,690
the last if you were in here for the
last presentation only got the last

461
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:39,570
night but it looked like it was about
doctor doctor is fantastic and I i heard

462
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,960
you like doctor doctor for your doctor
they're actually the doctor doctor

463
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:55,570
doctor doctor then the challenge by
deviating from against standard

464
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:01,130
platforms coding languages access
mechanisms protocol storage etc

465
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,830
you expose yourself to additional risk
reach outage misuse right so if you're

466
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,740
telling people yet you can set up your
own system wherever just make sure it

467
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,470
works if the customer the role in all
the time they're gonna go grab you know

468
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:22,089
it'll be PHP Ruby on Rails in some kind
of no sleep all day today I don't know

469
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:29,510
and there's no standard you can't
monitor it you can't control that

470
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:37,410
so again we're talking about making sure
that you provide any one of these

471
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:44,359
responsibilities with automated to
implement a system if they need a server

472
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,140
spun out there click a button that will
help developers certainly if the

473
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:57,140
developers are leading the developer
stay in compliance up a new service

474
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:02,879
management rapid release this integrated
production hopefully it means in some

475
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,809
kind of ternary release you have
different levels of production

476
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:16,250
environments and honestly I didn't
understand that some degree

477
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,010
can't dictate the way that we operate
the way we do business there are best

478
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:26,849
practices they are smart and secure ways
of doing it but the joke is always made

479
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:37,519
like I do right on I developed when I do
a development production and development

480
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:43,180
production is in nineteen what are you
going to do what are you putting in

481
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,700
place consider understanding
authorization execution approval testing

482
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,220
deployment making sure that those pieces
are in place that you have a strong

483
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:58,629
mechanism for protecting your customers
through this process something breaks

484
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,400
you have a way of putting them in an
environment that isn't broken for the

485
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:10,490
time being some kind of canary in areas
that they managed and you get the Canary

486
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:24,750
Build I something's wrong in the mine
mine the gas gas those pieces are in

487
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:28,559
grow and change me that you have to
maintain them but it can be done in

488
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,069
David's even in releasing the debt
becomes really important developers

489
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:39,820
understanding requirements their systems

490
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,460
not just the code right the application
of developing on but knowing knowing

491
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:51,070
something about the systems of those
applications and not only civilian

492
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,940
ticket changes I said that already

493
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,310
repeating myself but submitting tickets
having tickets approved for changes to

494
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:08,040
their ATM yes environment but whatever
you know wherever it's hosted blades and

495
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:15,390
the complication facility I don't know
but making sure that you're jacking we

496
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,170
get into some of those additional
criteria availability we just

497
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,670
availability easy thing about
performance deficits as a solution for

498
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,840
that can we just go to the shops where
is made of your account right that can

499
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,300
be there can be like it needs your
reaction

500
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:36,120
cloud infrastructure outsourcing these
complex cumbersome seemingly costly

501
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:43,759
process but this may look at this and
say capex right you gotta stand up these

502
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,710
servers that's that's expensive moving
tomorrow in objects they would reduce

503
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,450
costs help them understand that it may
be true it may be true but your

504
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,140
application you need to know that your
system that case you're targeting for

505
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:02,009
that shift really are cheaper there
running some back in process to keep

506
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,990
their server live all the time and you
can you get twelve thousand dollar bill

507
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:16,759
and you didn't expect to spend six times
as much as we are right now

508
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,290
help them understand that preferably
before

509
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:28,930
to remain on death but it struck
management that outage risk there are

510
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:34,580
out at risk with a cloud has has your
Gmail ever on down has Twitter ever gone

511
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:44,950
down right just because Netflix Netflix
is a great example right that's a yes

512
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,580
have you ever had problems with Netflix
has it ever gloated slowly or has it

513
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,700
ever have they had an hour just
absolutely so it doesn't solve just

514
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,990
saying I'm going to Amazon doesn't solve
your problems of even redundancy or or

515
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:04,759
availability need to make sure that
you're in separate regions opening up

516
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:11,140
new regions you're gonna have customers
say I can't have that in the us- you

517
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:15,750
have to isolate that right so making
sure that management understands that

518
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:25,320
it's not as easy as just saying to the
cloud whenever you're opening access to

519
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:32,520
additional responsibilities roles people
opening up additional risk so it's just

520
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:39,400
more attack point more laptops
smartphones grabbed and so when we were

521
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,200
thinking about considering what we need
to have in place in this kind of remind

522
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:52,339
employees about boundaries computer and
device use for seeing strong

523
00:51:52,340 --> 00:52:00,030
authentication is you factor where ever
you can do factor authentication data

524
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:05,509
integrity I'm gonna skip this one
because it

525
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:10,639
it's really about input and output and
it over last change management thinking

526
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:11,529
about it

527
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:19,829
contact privacy third-party tools again
in a group of teens killed whatever you

528
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:24,679
call them have the ability to stand up a
system from top to bottom

529
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:30,989
they're gonna say thats shining and they
say it does what I needed to do I'm

530
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:36,919
gonna use their now you're putting data
in a third party and how are you

531
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:43,709
evaluate so here we are talking about a
vendor so critical

532
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:50,259
customers will care tell us about the
security of your tell us about security

533
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:56,699
organization great let me explain to you
everything looks good are you putting I

534
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:01,899
get any third parties but you're ok
we'll have you done in evaluation of it

535
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:06,759
yes no but I'm pretty sure they're good
but that's not that's not what we can

536
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:12,949
tell customers in here so it's damaging
amateur vendor review is important

537
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:18,299
my one caveat there is it's not a one
size fits all again

538
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:23,759
Lorenzo Cain is the only blanket that
covers everything other than that you

539
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:28,399
have to do data classification you've
got to educate your customers are you

540
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:32,368
putting in our appt why is that
important to you when you're evaluating

541
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:37,369
your vendors what am I putting that out
if its marketing that's just putting

542
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:45,880
maybe internal communications documents
graphics in Dropbox are you gonna be

543
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:54,459
evaluating that the same as you do your
nets that has your DL right so making

544
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:57,959
sure you play some intelligence in doing
that third-party review is critical of

545
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:04,669
save everyone time it just makes it a
better world

546
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:11,549
getting to the end you're welcome it
should not jeopardize compliance

547
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:22,230
consider the disgust conversations with
management and you should be fine and

548
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:29,540
tackling that ship jobs from wherever
you're at today but it does it does

549
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:34,130
include a couple of these key takeaways
I wanna bring expected considering the

550
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:39,140
rest when you are looking at potential
when you're looking at a system where

551
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,770
you're looking at a change endeavor but
this process we really want to do away

552
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:44,630
with this or something

553
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,730
asking you for access to some system
really think about what's the risk what

554
00:54:48,730 --> 00:55:01,250
is the risk that I don't mean that like
her no I mean think about and how table

555
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:08,720
this is especially in an area where you
may have had operations responsibilities

556
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,058
security operations even if your
application security make sure you have

557
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,470
a seat at the table you can communicate
to your new management if it is new

558
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:23,069
management what those security
requirements and compliance requirements

559
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:28,960
are because they are different
understanding then those requirements

560
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,339
will be key in having the conversation
it's knowing stock to knowing the

561
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:40,640
criteria is availability on the table is
confidentiality on the table if I'm ISO

562
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,589
20022 I have an eye SMS are we reviewing
all these policies and procedures

563
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:55,349
annually so now I mean now you know
better than the guys that are doing and

564
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:59,900
that's from you know it so I think I
think that's probably the most key

565
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,859
takeaway and equip myself because I
thought I would give up for them no

566
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:10,400
additional risk your decision unless of
course you would consider all the things

567
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:18,839
that really didn't I did not realize
that I have researched like a stage for

568
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:24,319
we have two minutes if there are any
questions

569
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:42,930
be happy to take them otherwise I have
work at this point any questions

570
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,490
a great idea
