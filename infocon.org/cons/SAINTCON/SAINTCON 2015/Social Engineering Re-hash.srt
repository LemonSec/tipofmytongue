1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
this year and the scene was a lot
shorter so I'm giving the shorter

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,780
version of the talk is it feels like
it's rushed that's because it is so I

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,259
wanna talk about social engineering and
was not destroy computers what happened

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,140
with little

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:30,939
ok so let me know how the story begins I
am a developer I write code and pearl

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:38,600
and I took a lot of buses in junior high
and high school and college and I don't

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,559
know how many of your fans of xkcd
executed is a great couple hours like

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,578
one weekend messing with perot had more
impact on my career then so many other

9
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,690
classes that I took throughout my career
so that's where I come from my memory I

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,108
I love doing software development I love
doing something development in perot I

11
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,689
think it's a fabulous language with lots
of greed and weird features to it still

12
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:13,929
has a bit of a culture so its dynamic
and exciting out of this occasion it is

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,850
more of a do what I mean kind of
language that I do what I say they're

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,100
gonna buy goods there's always more than
one way to do something and I think

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,380
that's kind of a hacker mine said right
now I enjoy seems like a hacker and I

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,530
don't mean necessarily the actor who
wants to break into your computer I mean

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,390
more of I wanna know how this works I
want to understand how old these pieces

18
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,680
together I want to take things apart and
find out where all the components are on

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,490
the guy who visit to do consider what's
this thing on the badge

20
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,449
know what is the sensor do with that
sensor do does that work

21
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,990
know that doesn't ok so I became just
another pearl lacquered how many of you

22
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:07,089
seem that the pro camel nobody else just
shoot a couple of you kind of testing

23
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,750
little things that actually print out
the phrase just another pro hacker if

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,269
you run it in girl if you're a girl guy
that's cool if you're not a pro-gay you

25
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,319
think why would anyone like that

26
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,329
well it's kind of a hobby thing you know
where does do that so that's so after I

27
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,170
was April hacker I realized that some of
the things that we do in life

28
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:38,569
did we do it in computers actually came
from the way that humans operate and I

29
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,208
realized that the operating system to
ease the commuter dark attempts to model

30
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:50,470
how humans were we want to make our
machines like us maybe not as you know

31
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,500
we have a technological singularity
kinda kind of situation but martyrs is

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,190
solved problems for us on a regular
basis how many do you like the problems

33
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,880
in computer software you'd like to
solving problems really cool rate that's

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,730
great and I love it I also like having
other people solve problems for me so

35
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,850
that's when I became a person actor and
I really enjoy understanding how humans

36
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,150
work

37
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:24,010
but then it became a problem and turtle
and this whole mindset created a monster

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,609
and so for the benefit of science we're
gonna talk a little about how that works

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,390
how many fans of portal portal 2 Way
better graphics and potency maybe I was

40
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:44,010
gonna puzzles Monday so let's talk about
a couple of the different experiments

41
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,840
that I have done as far as social
engineering the first one you've heard

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,340
me to tell the story before the nite
moves or so I was working a job that I

43
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,230
have a little bit of extra time when I
was on break and you know sometimes when

44
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,869
you really get your co-workers and you
have extra time you can bring together

45
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:13,010
bad things happen so we decided that we
were going to run an experiment because

46
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,019
we found somewhere in the office

47
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:25,970
a piece of duct work it's a metal pipe
maybe six inches around 33 talk to your

48
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,200
doctor to the used to put a heating and
cooling of whatever through the building

49
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,620
and we decided that we would go over to
one of our printers will to computer

50
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,270
printers a sign that said do not move
thanks management paper down there and

51
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,200
sit in the middle hallway just to see
what would happen but what do people do

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,830
when they see a sign that says do not
move things management

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:58,000
well the answer to that in just a minute
then also at the same time because I

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,800
have lots of free time I found out that
puts hands on my chest and put things

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,450
really weird what do you do with a break
in the wall to make samples were ever

56
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,390
made in my favorite thing but I thought
you know it's instructive case you a

57
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,080
nice passing case I want to do is open
up this little just walk around the

58
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,609
people holding hands on them and see
what happens

59
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,850
really think about what you would expect
to happen in that situation and then

60
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,910
this is a new one that I knew sorry that
I started telling ya see a time when

61
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,630
someone attempted to socially engineer
me which was lots of fun I went to my

62
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:48,550
local home improvement store and I was
going to get a sensor for my Christmas

63
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,650
lights I wanted to have them turn on
automatically when it got dark and turn

64
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,159
off the lights and then I wouldn't have
to keep flipping the switch

65
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,290
and you really enjoy putting such as
Josh so that others enjoy 7 could

66
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,790
probably use this device going into this
home improvement store walking all the

67
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,540
way to the back all the money in
whatever and I get to lighting section

68
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,820
all the way back now have a couple of
these different things

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,050
these items gentleman who is there has
two of his dogs in the store with him

70
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,870
and on service dogs just regular dogs
which is kind of odd and as soon as I

71
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,140
walk up to deteriorate he says I know
you you're that guy and you know

72
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,700
sometimes that's something that just
happens

73
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,590
regular everyday people because people
recognize you maybe don't know who they

74
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,289
are or maybe they think the year someone
they know when a doctor not but usually

75
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,280
that's david has not followed with you
that guy that shot someone in that game

76
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:06,599
and I thought to myself so next story I
work for a company called Lugo's some of

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,890
the building of other one of the
sponsors here and I've worked with us

78
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,560
for a long time one of the things that
they have as benefits for the employees

79
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,930
there's a rewards program and when one
employee recognizes that an employee

80
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,500
does something great what they can do is
send some sort of digital currency to

81
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,600
someone else and they can use these
points or whatever to purchase items

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,380
some specified list and they get a
reward out of that and it's really cool

83
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,000
I enjoyed a lot

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,500
and hopefully those of you who are here
from Bluehost will give you points for a

85
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,210
given stock not just sitting well it
turns out that I have a really common

86
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,400
last name my last name is Johnson flu
season and is a source of the second

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,179
most common last names starting with
speaking people that's a lot of people

88
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,000
with last name of Johnson and this is
one of the more common letters for for

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,130
sale as well so when you get to a
situation where usernames email

90
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,850
addresses that are used for a water
systems like this are generated from

91
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,700
those things sometimes you have a
collision we've actually had someone who

92
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,510
had a collision have to sometimes when I
was trying to generate automatically the

93
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:25,940
handles for the challenge and we have to
sort that out but it turns out that this

94
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,230
company that we have the rumors forum so
you didn't sort that out and so because

95
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,370
they didn't sort that out I suddenly had
access to someone else's reward system

96
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,349
and I got all of their credits and I
decided that wasn't necessarily a good

97
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,290
thing because you know it's very honest
to be taking those and I wanted to see

98
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,829
if I could use social engineering
principles to improve the world I wanted

99
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,290
to try and make the world a better place
so I decided I would call it a US

100
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,500
company and see what I can do to take
commissions away from myself and give it

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,600
to the rightful owner is another word
was story time we can talk about the

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,640
social engineering process first thing
in the social engineering processes

103
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,470
research you need to do information
gathering find out everything that you

104
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,650
really should need to know to be able to
interact with other human what they

105
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,750
liked what they don't like working the
situation there in all of those things

106
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,690
are really important is being able to
perform any kind of social engineering

107
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,810
sometimes that research includes going
to the trash have you found something

108
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,739
interesting in the trash trash and sorry
maybe I'm just we've seen some like

109
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,600
weird paper hanging out somewhere on the
ground and pictures out like a cool how

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,550
many of you have sound really critical
documents sitting on the ground

111
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,769
even if you knew that they found my
secret top secret military documents in

112
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:05,330
a dumpster at one point it's true it's
absolutely true people really crazy

113
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,370
things away you should be careful about
the things you throw away but if you've

114
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,870
done your research on someone that's a
great place to start

115
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,019
Nexus finding you are be able to come up
with a great how you're going to you

116
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,310
addressed some 100 rose stem what you're
planning on doing what you''re protects

117
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:33,979
nineteen a little bit about time

118
00:10:33,980 --> 00:11:10,480
you have to have a different situations
for approaches some people for circle to

119
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,970
prove something for a woman wrote
something democratic approach all of

120
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,240
those things are different approaches
that can be used to social engineering

121
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,100
delivery is terribly important when you
are speaking with someone and you want

122
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,300
to see them for when someone is speaking
to you and they want to socially

123
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,270
engineer you the confidence they have in
what they're doing

124
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,300
means a lot to get the video 2002

125
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:43,010
maybe I don't mind sitting here and then
extrication class of all getting out if

126
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,530
you're trying to provide some sort of
social engineering engagement you want

127
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,060
to be able to get out without people
knowing that you were there but we

128
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,020
without remembering who you were and if
you don't end up doing that you might

129
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,980
need to run a relentless ask

130
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:11,170
you late right out very outdated secret
service your voice tried to jump out the

131
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:20,760
window my partner has custody yes we are
going to my W government checks here

132
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:37,620
paper trail what steps taken on a
myspace plz really makes me do my gun to

133
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:46,250
global you're taking a look inside look
at the apartments of walking into the

134
00:12:46,250 --> 00:13:01,940
car as we speak or write to the lapd
again I don't want people walking to my

135
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:16,180
car I see what's your name

136
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:31,160
Asian be too careful States side
militarily would lend itself a pretty

137
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:40,819
good color inside shot him downstairs
with the I got a sure thing just doing

138
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,120
favors for secular gets evidence
downstairs made here making the bed lapd

139
00:13:47,120 --> 00:14:01,010
should be here any sec

140
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:19,260
he's an actor but there's a little bit
of acting institutions

141
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,930
social engineering reloading that's
starting the conversation before it ever

142
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,650
get started

143
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,560
free texting and this is the assumption
of a rule which you may or may not

144
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,400
belong to the previous video pretending
to be a secret service agent is free

145
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,630
texting there are some legal concerns of
that so if you choose to do that please

146
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,760
make sure that you consult an attorney I
am NOT one so I can give you great

147
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,080
advice other than be careful what you do

148
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,630
elicitation this is the process of
getting answers to your questions

149
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:05,410
directly this happens a lot for example
when I get the soggy Torres think on the

150
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,579
day that I was coming to the conference
to get the talks had someone asked me if

151
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:20,080
there was a great coffee shop in the
area and without thinking I'm not from

152
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,660
here so I don't know that's a great way
to elicit a response from someone

153
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,110
because I disclose information that
wasn't even in the question how many of

154
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,150
you would be likely to get that kind of
information that question just about

155
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,400
everybody right if someone says 18 over
a coffee shop or do you know where the

156
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,209
Elizabeth whatever building is here on
campus you say I don't go to school here

157
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,910
I don't know that information

158
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,900
well you just give us some commissions
well

159
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,449
the situation where you want to make
sure that you understand what bremerton

160
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,950
someone else's in how they view the
world and if possible get them to view

161
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,250
the world through your little frame when
you can get someone to view the world

162
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,240
through your little brain you can
control just about everything that they

163
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,250
are thinking about that

164
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,190
WR your liking you right now

165
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:24,190
little bit more ok being like Apple is a
huge differentiator in being able to get

166
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,020
people to do what you would like them to
do and it's a very likeable person but

167
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,380
you would like to improve your
relationships with other people you

168
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,710
could try being a little bit more
likable observation listening very

169
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,940
carefully to what people say in the last
50 we watch there's a very important

170
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,640
segment where he the FBI agent for his
identification

171
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,300
and the reason why he does that is
because he listened to the FBI agent his

172
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,469
identification being like someone is is
very helpful but observing protocols

173
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,640
they have established is very important
and into this is where you're actually

174
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,470
making someone make a choice to be able
to disclose information or perform some

175
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,810
action that you would like them to do
and those are the cooler parts of social

176
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,349
engineering motivators motivates us to
do things are a lot of different things

177
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:29,469
that motivate us as human beings the
first twenty years thirty you know it's

178
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,590
a possibly willing came through right
even if you feel bad as somebody no

179
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,540
imagery school you're not the boss of me
and my mom my dad we all did right

180
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,399
authority has a great influence on us
and if you can exert authority on

181
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,250
someone you have a greater chance of
being able to have them do your thing as

182
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,220
you would like there is someone has
authority over you you're probably more

183
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,640
likely to do what they would like for
example passos you I wanted to this

184
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,460
report by the end of the day you're
likely to do that than have someone from

185
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,170
another department who has no influence
whatsoever says I would like you to this

186
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,290
report by the end of the day

187
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:23,080
assist our words with this brand

188
00:18:23,080 --> 00:19:20,189
started dating I'm not willing to doing
something that you probably should

189
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,159
because this comfortable during a
vulnerable position there's also

190
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:33,750
commitment how many of you have heard of
the moving because I said I would two of

191
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:40,370
you it's kind of cool movement this
particular motivator is very very useful

192
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,570
against me and my kids use it all the
time they say dad

193
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,779
promised he would really two stories
tonight I you may read one how much you

194
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,580
wanna bet that I would read two stories
at night every single time I will do

195
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,259
that and it's because I promise I want
to seal the value inside of myself doing

196
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:04,210
what I said I would do it you said you
would do something someone could

197
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:11,399
potentially use that to their advantage
and then the momentum that consistency I

198
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:22,500
wanna do I always you how did you park
in the same spot today that you didn't

199
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,920
thousands of years ago and it still true
surrender when you concede something to

200
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,560
someone you're likely to concede again
and when someone can see something to

201
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,780
you are more likely to be able to get
them to concede again here and there

202
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:49,970
should be things that appear in a
country like the one that we live in

203
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:56,390
where we don't really have a terribly
oppressive regime if you feel like you

204
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,910
will not be able to feed your family to
worry you won't be able to be safe on

205
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:08,300
your way home you're far more likely to
do what some would like to read a few

206
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,580
things from money I made you have jobs
raise all of you probably read acerbic

207
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,350
motivator and sometimes that's a good
thing it helps us to do things like

208
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,480
participate in society and contribute in
a way that's meaningful so that we can

209
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,450
have jobs but a lot of times it's really
hard for us to get away from that read a

210
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,550
couple of years ago when we passed out
redford

211
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:39,669
devices to the attendees of the scammers
how many do you remember that there was

212
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,230
a phishing email sent out to the members
of the cons saying three more dollars to

213
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,750
be able to come pick up your resume to
compete at the registration desk lots of

214
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,260
people showed up to do that because they
wanted even though legitimate that

215
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,770
social engineering did you think you
deserve something you'll do crazy things

216
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,920
to get that our society is full I
deserve this or have the right to this

217
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,640
and we're willing to go to extreme
lengths to keep cool we deserve I

218
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,140
deserve to be able to have this kind of
car in this kind of house or whatever it

219
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,520
happens to be my kids deserve an
education and that may or may not be

220
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,710
true but feeling like you deserve
something modifies the way you behave

221
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:40,890
inertia obligation and if you do things
because somebody a favor and you do it

222
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:47,680
pacification someone did something you
so you should do something for them

223
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,640
happens scarcity have you seen these
little things on Amazon there's only one

224
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,340
left

225
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,790
they're never going to print this book
again

226
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:05,460
you laugh when you see that influences
the way that you view that page and

227
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,340
you're likely to make a choice to
purchase that item just because of that

228
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:27,309
convention

229
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:34,059
so I should this video I talk about
social engineering and a lot of people

230
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:38,590
saying this just isn't fair it's a
disney animated show it's not that big

231
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,309
of a deal

232
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,970
no one's in the trap by societal
convention well that's not entirely true

233
00:23:43,970 --> 00:24:04,610
ABC news video the gentleman in the
elevator now and subsequently this man

234
00:24:04,610 --> 00:25:06,389
in the day

235
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:42,050
in real life time and a lot of the
belief that you hold her because of that

236
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,889
many of you laughed at that clip social
engineering right there is that really

237
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:56,410
funny I don't know somebody just got
manipulated maybe that's funny

238
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,330
there was a laugh tracks of other people
were laughing right so let's do a little

239
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:07,220
stories the reward system where I was
trying to return ownership of an account

240
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,510
of someone else I called up and said I
have access to someone else's account

241
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:18,879
and I probably shouldn't you give it
back to them I give them another email

242
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,750
address

243
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,170
they looked it up and everything was
just fine page check with their

244
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,299
supervisor to make sure it was ok

245
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:30,019
but they didn't have any way of
validating that I was who I said I was I

246
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:36,950
think that's a problem in the case of
the gentleman who accused me shooting

247
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,499
someone it again and killing them the
best part of the story is that my best

248
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:47,749
friend was with me at the time and he
said oh yeah you totally did that point

249
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:52,379
I had no choice but to vehemently deny
it I didn't shoot anyone

250
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:58,779
screaming at the top of my head I didn't
shoot anyone and I had to get out of us

251
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:03,999
were passed because it felt
uncomfortable I was manipulated through

252
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:08,090
social engineering just because someone
wanted to have an exciting time and

253
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,269
accused me of cheating so many things I
have blood whatever even though wasn't

254
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,259
me but i just ignored it probably mean
there was no nosair but sometimes it's

255
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,549
hard you want to maintain your good
reputation or whatever the case of the

256
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:27,408
Bushman's you might want to try this
time I walked around the bush in box on

257
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,539
the people I did not say a word

258
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,730
everyone took one

259
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,610
I had people asking me right after that
why you giving me this and I said I

260
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,590
didn't give you that I just in front of
you doing something out in front of

261
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,780
someone almost always means they will
take it a message food and then they'll

262
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:50,620
say no I don't want to have that could
do whatever I know if they will probably

263
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,449
take in the case of the piece of duct
work that we saw a sign that said do I

264
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:03,270
move things management that piece of
doctor in a way for six weeks and we

265
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,810
decided to up the ante just a little bit
and put it right in front of the CEO's

266
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,480
office so that she had rounded every
morning as he got into her office we

267
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,280
left it there for a couple of days and
then the city was over but not once did

268
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,730
she think wait a minute I'm the
management

269
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,480
that's not something that I said so

270
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,929
talk a little about social engineering
at things I want you to understand the

271
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,530
social engineering is something that we
do you do with your friends he do it to

272
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,059
your neighbors I'm doing it to you right
now you gonna do to children when you go

273
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,309
home you talks coming home in to rate
their you need to make a decision about

274
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,139
where you send them one of social
engineering tactics are you willing to

275
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,650
go what you think is right I think you
should think carefully about the things

276
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:56,030
you say and do because they influence
people we deserve better as a community

277
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:02,840
and as a society we need to make it
changed we should avoid the traps and

278
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,820
make our own lives better I want to help
you and that's why I'm giving this talk

279
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,250
but it's your responsibility in the end
you are the one who needs to make the

280
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,059
change you are the one who needs to
improve your life your family's life

281
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:19,710
your communities like your employers
laid there aren't enough people helping

282
