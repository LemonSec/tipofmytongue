1
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:32,879
here we stay in homes

2
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:44,589
my job here and we were seen as a system
admin we're gonna stand over a year ago

3
00:00:44,589 --> 00:01:18,500
so coming up with in their last year the
idea was to be called me up and Troy

4
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,330
like a we want to have a hardware
hacking village we want to have a

5
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,590
project everybody's bad we want to go
outside hurry and get interested in

6
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,110
hardware and said well that's cool but
we should do it on the badge so we got

7
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,319
seventy eighty percent of the people
here through the hardware hacking

8
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,810
village they cited their badge everybody
loved it was awesome and this year we

9
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,259
said well it was cool we did it we don't
really want to do it again so the theme

10
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,250
of this year was to use the bags to the
conference experience you know what can

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,580
we do to make the Badger link back to
the conference in the conference back so

12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,220
keep that in mind so there's plan and
then there's reality that's the plan is

13
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,680
what I presented to the committee of the
board and said hey here's how to go down

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,599
here is how we're gonna pull this off

15
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,540
go ahead and get a check and get
together and make it happen now and then

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,209
on the Raiders reality

17
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,890
hardware development took a lot longer
than we expected we were expecting to

18
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,549
have hardware prototypes pretty much
locked in by April we got it first

19
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:41,460
prototype PCB back to life the TV in its
trusted us part by little exactly to

20
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:48,750
this day they were just over so we goin
on the hardware and so were cutting into

21
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,790
the software with hardware tool that we
also used to contracts simply house

22
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,500
solutions you're not gonna make the
badges weren't about to pick and place

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,610
my hand 600 badges technical lovely wife
and I had our perpetual prototypes that

24
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:13,590
would be a full time we finalize the PCB
design it and blocked it in August 30th

25
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,770
and an EMS gave us a call back on
September 11 and we picked up finalized

26
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:28,390
production run of badges on October
eight so slight you got to talk and we

27
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,130
want to get to a Q&A so we just gonna
get arrested these on your left there

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,450
was one is responding right yeah this is
the first attempt the screen when it

29
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,060
when they lit up we have been sent one
right been struggling trying to get it

30
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,850
to load up your mom probably was the
step forward but they're bored we use

31
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:58,859
$30 that's the chip will use the next
nigga its review

32
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,860
we're going out all the things you need
not be choosers so it's great to death

33
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,380
but it's tough to have these big mess of
wires get ahead to have to look it up

34
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,340
for what he wanted to work good and then
worked on it and then it was unhooked

35
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,488
outweigh the time I got home so text you
were a couple other shootings we have

36
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,339
played around with it

37
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:29,799
agreement with one year left is a
monochromatic LCD backlight which is

38
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,070
kinda cool but it was actually more than
the screen we did it go across the one

39
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,370
on the right was just a little bit
bigger I want to say is like a 2.8 yes

40
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:50,070
the 220 and touch screen but calm the
interfacing with it was a great option

41
00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:01,200
that you point to sit on the left that's
cool cat which is the cat package we

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,389
used your card where I attended the MSU
start out with you do the schematic you

43
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,430
throw down the pieces you're pretty sure
we're gonna go on board and then you hit

44
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,630
the snooze button and it drives me a
little liars are talking using you get a

45
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:27,960
train route so that it was fun on the
right that's the word I was talking

46
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,739
about that have two problems if you look
just to the right of the prototype an

47
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,950
upside down there

48
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,150
Gold Line speaking through there's
nothing on the left's that's where it

49
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:46,530
was her mask was shifted to make some of
the pins and usable suspect about two

50
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:55,500
weeks so that was the build out on that
first prototype even though we solve the

51
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,910
problems like let's try we was the first
time we had the likes of the board is

52
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,410
pretty awesome but it was still a we
just had shorts on the right was the

53
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,420
greenback's the second round of the
British exports

54
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:22,300
and Canada first batch so everybody's
been asking us all week he can happen to

55
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,090
bad what's what is under the hood what
is the better here's the laundry list

56
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:36,210
Alex Megane 2 5683 video goes into the
Big Brother the mega chips Arduino and

57
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,659
tons of open source projects use we
really ran into limitations on his

58
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,550
memory will will really hit my Sharona
the memories the things just the RAM

59
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:59,090
memory so this year we knew just like
everybody loved another through with it

60
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,919
we just can't make a bad joke we are
something that got us all the way over

61
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,050
these super cheap ass press it tastes
like modules came out about the same

62
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:18,140
last year yes b12 is also the only two
inches TFT were talking about flash

63
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,719
memory to store the schedule and
whatnots so around after the attack and

64
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:33,150
process is good enough to use as a quad
waiting to see a trip to Egypt actually

65
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,440
didn't end up using so there's some
features that we go hard work or because

66
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,680
we cannot wait on the hardware we didn't
get a written for my bad time these

67
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:56,360
things are pretty cool chips ECCE Shaw
also be cool if you did when you were

68
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,140
part of that is saying to you and you
entered in the country for two weeks we

69
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:06,080
talked about being challenged by Contra
Costa gotta do kind of slowed down down

70
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,710
left right left right BA start slow
excerpt unlocks the future just 600

71
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,489
Andrew yeah

72
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:23,300
IR receiver there's also neier led on
there that you can drive where want to

73
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,810
do some batch of education that almost
made it to the cutting room floor

74
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,940
everyone should be my own children how
to use a model of an ideal my own self

75
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,490
and because we got last minute shipments
of lithium ion cells that were I'm

76
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,260
convinced referred from China they
weren't free then we had a little light

77
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,830
syndrome if you look at the bottom left
is you're looking down at your bad

78
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,250
looking chip that's a juvenile
approximate slights answers you can

79
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:03,550
celebrate it is the room there is a
tension century there was never a major

80
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,439
component is like three cents and PC for
mister right above the buttons we're

81
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,970
gonna put up all the hardware and
software stocks leading the Gerbers in

82
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,270
the material so you can still make your
own badges

83
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,520
so this was billed as one last night the
slide last night

84
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,610
punch card for the repository just ended
up sure what time we are working on this

85
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,170
thing

86
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,130
lot of other stuff in the lead us yet
after work in early mornings on the

87
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,480
weekends and even during the week

88
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,360
attention to the 9 a.m. lunch boxes of
those were all done the night before it

89
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,880
can be found in the morning when I came
in from another thing we give advice

90
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,270
here because we had WiFi module we
tracked you like the Big Brother that we

91
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,770
are so if you went into the maps and
strolled around if things are working

92
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,960
well it would show your current location
with a pretty good approximation

93
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,540
accuracy on there to do that we use our
wireless system that we have here is a

94
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,040
Cisco Wireless and they have a piece to
that system itself the connected mobile

95
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:29,120
PC and macs we import a floor mat BedRug
assumes its location of the eighties and

96
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:39,380
it's not great three issues accuracy but
it's good enough to get a feel for how

97
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,310
many people are in each tracking true so
we're gonna get some cool stuff that she

98
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,709
would structure popular which ones
weren't maybe get some feedback to the

99
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,050
presenters on well you did something to
really take people off about 10 minutes

100
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:01,990
and you presume that slide out whatever
it was and then kind of this is these

101
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,410
are all the steps that we pulled from
the CMX Andrew into a plastic surgeon

102
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,630
combining things we did

103
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,480
individualize easy what would your inner
what room you were in based on your

104
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,910
whereabouts was and you can kind of see
the different rooms growing and

105
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,860
shrinking as the day went on

106
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:30,650
so we stand on the shoulders of giants
were blocked so we gotta get major props

107
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:36,920
to Jill grands he say he was the first
one to do it electronic batch of 14 and

108
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,160
even before that would just run clark
also has lost you to get to the next

109
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,270
level

110
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:55,850
why was he was but was and the ninja
networks those kids ages including one

111
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:03,220
that has pretty much the same layout for
letting me crippled bits of the

112
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,560
electronic components and software and
software you know them so you Jonathan

113
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,069
Harris to work on the firmware for the
SP is an attempt to your firmware to

114
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,920
handle the communication then all the
other open source hardware folks with

115
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,500
all the great tips thanks to you talkin
organization think I'm going to the

116
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,890
committee by slashing team on top of the
top /

117
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,370
Ogden great contract manufacturer they
were amazing to work with a whole bunch

118
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,470
getting us our first job of contract
manufacturing done with all the mistakes

119
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,120
made by made mostly parked for getting
US number of words and getting some new

120
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,110
western red around stencils out of Grupo
Matt wants to get in big props wherever

121
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:07,980
matt is ya down the hardware hacking
village we overnight it so

122
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,540
JRC this experience for a good price is
who I was never a group of CNX and some

123
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,930
cool stuff we were so University
activism for letting us hijack the

124
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,640
wireless network in doing company time
now to launch their friends families for

125
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,319
letting it slip through standard and my
wife for helping me this first time

126
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:36,660
types fears about scene I did most of
the hardware wrangle the team lifted the

127
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:43,810
software software Jonathan news as I
said the amputee nude MCU you were set

128
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,609
this wouldn't happen although the
integration with the ridge 6 many routes

129
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,820
and challenge gave system everybody that
has had to have their badges switched it

130
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,940
has been manual work by some including
some sequel statements to get him switch

131
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,850
server lessons learned for next year

132
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:09,180
Dustin graphics for the maps mike got
gift you working about that mister minit

133
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:18,930
Mart getting a mass area code of silence
now there's just a placeholder now will

134
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,189
probably get it up there by the end of
the day for sure we didn't want to the

135
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:46,620
game board of the closing minutes there
are more than one where it's not really

136
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,280
anything currently in with you again
Patnode billion in it into something

137
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,670
where the screen of just a black you
look like you're not powered on but that

138
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,689
means you're ready to play

139
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:07,580
yeah you're a different USB you get in
stone yet you driver put up all the

140
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,750
instructions but the point is you don't
have to buy a $50 programmer inside Iran

141
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,650
headers or anything to change the code
we built in mic figure that out for us

142
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,420
got it the right thing set up you need
it lacks the bootloader where you just

143
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,010
totally brick church if you will still
lead programmer make sure you make it

144
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,350
through the hardware hacking village

145
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,310
realize now that I'm signing us how much
people but we do have slightly updated

146
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:44,170
about yours if you have any problems
especially with the battery's gonna take

147
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:54,240
the battery out what you can control
without any extra hardware I think

148
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:34,770
that's it yeah we want to leave that
slide up so you get your first and then

149
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,829
who like the better last year where it
was

150
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:44,120
here's a big pile of parts to build it
so pretty slick here in the room the

151
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,430
people have been asking so far has been
they tended to like it will be better

152
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,630
than it was fully functional we've got
to be back and some good ideas it's it's

153
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,620
functional but here's an extra bling you
can add a little extra functionality and

154
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,080
that's kind of what we're leaning
towards for next time

155
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:09,680
any other questions that's right that's
right I'm sooo next year we've only

156
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,760
committed to an electronic gadgetry the
year we'll see how it goes but the next

157
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,069
year the Arts and Crafts Village gonna
have googly eyes glitter I've got a bit

158
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,429
in right now on a retro the Dazzler

159
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:34,890
so yeah thank you for the reminder I
question whether it is we wanted to do

160
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,140
some cool stuff for the whole enhance
the experience here at the con we had to

161
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,310
have everybody was working backstage one
you know the the rate of bad building

162
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:51,679
was about 20% 30% of the back just got
to every day so it really work we need

163
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:10,620
everybody did ones development features
we had mine done so we're really only

164
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,750
use and three-quarters of the hardware
it was decided earlier with the board

165
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:27,810
and just suck it up and plugged it in
every time you waiting for hardware

166
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:41,179
another run of the same exact same
hardware and you'll notice the prototype

167
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,380
doesn't actually have a year on it so
yeah what would people think shook hands

168
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,570
with that be a good idea to do the exact
same hardware next year with more

169
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,950
software seems to actually be pretty
popular so here's a question are you

170
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:15,540
saying you do a day's alright dave says
you have attended every year if you're

171
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,649
on a team that they can only send out
the team you there one year you miss out

172
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,960
on the cool you've gotta have to do this
so we really have to have like just

173
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,650
about everything every year we get
people so we got was kind of a deal with

174
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:35,550
the IR we did our with the bags last
year one of one of the Jones is that you

175
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,409
take last year's batch and pointed at
this match the IR receiver will plateau

176
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:50,110
you have to put it in my youth level 34
if you built the Arduino down in the

177
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,030
hardware hacking village and accept it
because you could probably get it going

178
00:19:53,030 --> 00:20:02,399
to so they just got a bill get points
for you so it's gotta be dealing with

179
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,250
that

180
00:20:06,250 --> 00:21:17,460
so I need an error on the PCB and I the
backlight for the LCD is tied to a pier

181
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,770
and the plan was modulate that just the
brightness of the light sensor but I

182
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:30,180
cited to appear but doesn't do hardware
PWM PWM we didn't interrupt what would I

183
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,240
do so they didn't interrupt depending on
where was in the cycle of PWM it was on

184
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,150
the screen would stay white and it was
it would just watch the screen until

185
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:46,790
finished it'll be kinda like a radio
seizure inducing bad we just gonna do so

186
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:54,200
I we do another record it won't be the
same things like that but yet you was

187
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:02,500
between accelerometer the working right
now everything will go back to sleep

188
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,320
backlight of be the LCD adjusting more
so you get more battery left there and

189
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,110
it's you have a dinner cruise

190
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:17,719
you know right so deal we really thought
we would be able to get away without how

191
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:25,740
did not but we didn't want people will
show up than happy to the day ended it

192
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,049
with that would be better days anyway so
we probably would put an on off switch

193
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,250
just to see you next time

194
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,600
anything else

195
00:22:37,600 --> 00:23:08,350
anybody else or whatever at wifi loot or
general feedback

196
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,199
fill out the survey for the Con and
there's just a general comments as well

197
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,169
at the bottom right so so tag on a bad
idea

198
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:23,530
things have been since the comments and
we'll get all this factory worker at the

199
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:38,750
US government class what's up

200
00:23:38,750 --> 00:24:10,110
so much
