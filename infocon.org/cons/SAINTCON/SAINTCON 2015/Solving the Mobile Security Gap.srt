1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,190
okay thanks for staying so late this
afternoon she does and I went to include

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,369
software in a little bit about who I am
i dnt need telecommunications and ICT

3
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:27,720
industry for almost 20 years working for
her eyes Egypte General Dynamics as

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,240
follows

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,019
we don't see spending some time is
samsung says to me it really unique

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,820
perspective on what I've seen cairo's
implement here in the USA and worldwide

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,940
with multinationals and so what I'd like
to do today for the presentation is just

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,660
kinda want everybody through some things
that were see picture on the same page

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,309
and then I like some of the work that
we're doing is the company to secure the

10
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:59,870
various notes on the network has
ultimately anytime we look at these

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,699
devices they are they are in fact those
that are connecting into the system

12
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:11,020
works every day so with that set
securing the PCs are in the age of a PC

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,240
we knew that we have to place firewalls
and watch for network traffic that sort

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,158
of stuff so the days we had workers in
the office that maybe one for lunch at

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,869
the end of the day or the use of the
word reached left the office amount that

16
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,290
equipment there was pretty easy to
maintain that if the structure managing

17
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,820
controller right however

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,339
Betsy workforce as not too long ago 17
laptops moment doing work from the house

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,350
or coffee shop wherever it was
significant productivity gains with our

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,500
user base right so controlling those
laptops is very similar to controlling

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,750
the PCs we could the firewalls of place
we've got the disk drives to all those

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,259
sort of things and we could protect all
those end-users and market data however

23
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,729
all of that changed so in the days where
we have a blackberry of the structure

24
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,509
where all the devices connected to the
blackberry servers wrote over the

25
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,989
blackberry servers their networks of
your children in the proxy of the

26
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,120
traffic that changed when we started
introducing the consumer products the

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,590
phones and the iOS products so with that
said we've seen significant productivity

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,700
gains because they're I'm able to do
things like a group expense reports on

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,820
this expense reports do things like
salesforce.com get in you see what I'm

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,400
doing my carries climate counts and all
those productivity gains but again they

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,180
continue to the room which is cairo's
continue to allow different I T

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,160
communities to continue to connect these
various devices to their corporate

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,049
structure renouncing also the wearable
second round where the wearables are

34
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,000
talking to our devices more to the
various things and keeping tabs on

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,160
things like my heart rate how many steps
I take a day

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,980
be able to turn off my light my
refrigerator or all those things from

37
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,570
different SmartWatch so all these things
are great because we're seeing huge

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,380
tremendous productivity gains from it
and where we going with that right but

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,170
we're also seeing all these various
connected devices now on these networks

40
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,369
this internet of these and these two are
notes are connecting it to the networks

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,830
so all of these new devices that are
these consumer devices

42
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:44,910
it's a little frightening to see that
these devices are not putting the

43
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,270
security mechanisms that we put in place
when we looked at things like encrypting

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,590
the disk drives and stuff like this cuz
I can guarantee you new CIO would ever

45
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,190
let a device like this to leave the four
walls without any type of protection for

46
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,130
that device but it's amazing how we've
handed out millions of babies without

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:11,670
any protection on them for those users
so with that said movingly

48
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,489
in the health care industry alone on
this one

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,350
I've been working with the number of
companies taking things like pallets

50
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:26,410
connecting them to a Bluetooth scale at
the blue chip glucose monitor to do the

51
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,900
testing for type 2 and type 1 diabetes
so all of those devices are not security

52
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,969
traditionally known from NIT perspective
so with that said technology continues

53
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,340
to evolve to get these huge productivity
gains but it will be a missing part

54
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,940
knowledge this continues to be the
actual devices themselves with some type

55
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,479
of security on them so what happens to
somebody to get this product of mine and

56
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,690
be able to access a date on it from a
personal standpoint yes it could get

57
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,020
into it she said she'll they may be able
to get into my American Airlines so are

58
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,210
their candidate account to get access to
that information they could do little

59
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,388
bit of damage but that's not too
difficult to really make or break

60
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,500
anything

61
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,500
what is important is the corporate data
that resides within that resides within

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,200
this device each of you that is sitting
in here to think about the last week

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,000
alone was sensitive confidential
information if you touch to your company

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,090
that would be very damaging to your
company's into your brand is the

65
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:41,369
cybercriminals are to get access to this
story lies in the last couple of years

66
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:49,380
coming out just to check the various IDC
of course there's a number of companies

67
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,900
that are just coming from Czech defender
be actual community themselves are

68
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,989
coming out saying we're seeing huge
tremendous up tix going directly after

69
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,090
these mobile devices

70
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,419
what are they going after the first of
all these folks as we know are pretty

71
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,859
sophisticated individuals so whether
they're doing it in the case of like so

72
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,419
so many media attention whether they're
doing it for money or for political gain

73
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,580
we're seeing these attacks more and more
on what happened across it and they're

74
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,880
very very targeted tax at the various
enterprises one of the largest chipset

75
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,040
manufacturers across the planet came to
us with their own security software

76
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,140
cannot capture all the decent evening
we're going on on the mobile devices so

77
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,870
with that said once installed that
mobile drug prevention technology from

78
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,330
checkpoint they started saying that a
lot of the attacks that were happening

79
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,560
on their mobile handsets we're going
into their executive leadership not only

80
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,380
were they going after their executives
but they were also very targeted in

81
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,969
going down to their admin assistants
because it can figure out who's who in

82
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,530
the orchard and go directly after them
because they knew they had access to the

83
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,950
executives calendar not that sensitive
data

84
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:16,370
so personally just what I see one of the
projects that I work done for the nurses

85
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,890
up in the northeast we deployed about
three hundred and fifty Galaxy tabloids

86
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,140
the sea so at that time said you know I
really want to embrace the new mobile

87
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,969
tablets by getting rid of the two
laptops that are using because the

88
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,200
battery life was in allowing them to
continue their work throughout the whole

89
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,460
word a sofa bed at 2:30 standpoint it
makes sense that they wanted to use

90
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,650
tablets because they're giving them
anywhere from nine to 13 hours of

91
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,380
battery life for the day but sixty so
when we talk to them about using a

92
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,380
mobile device management company city
now I really don't want to manage the

93
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,050
devices I just wanna let my employees as
productive as possible because a lot of

94
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,140
the videos coming in the Millennials
they don't want us touching their user

95
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,380
experience can you just leave it alone

96
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,110
you know it's your choice it is and what
we would advise that you know will let

97
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,740
you make that decision it was
interesting because they started seeing

98
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,060
significant productivity gains by using
an application called embarked in

99
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,490
markets where it will tell you the blue
lines coming in three minutes five

100
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,130
minutes seven minutes that's really nice
just for using the various visiting

101
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,860
nurses are getting in and seeing one
sometimes two more clients a day so

102
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,200
imagine the better the bottom line is
that the money received these

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,409
significant

104
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,470
teams of productivity for the WorkSource
so they continue to leave those tablets

105
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,649
340 something I'm just running smoothly
there since then started downloading

106
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:54,550
another application in the opportunity
downloaded was the three flashlight is

107
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,120
often totally went out to the patients
homes that were saying that if they

108
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,120
can't see this year on the picture they
would need to turn on a brighter light

109
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,189
so they started downloading those free
out well unfortunately those freed

110
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:13,319
flashlight calves were ejected with
moammar we're probably within the next

111
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,430
week or two

112
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,750
the first one starting to install the
Google Play Store we started to see a

113
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,949
few days a hundred and fifty others
completely boy they were on grounds of

114
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:32,589
work so I personally have seen firsthand
that this is in some methods going on

115
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,319
about this mobile two years ago when I
started working with that see so we had

116
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:41,810
no solution and to bring to market to
help them with their only option was to

117
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,359
bring all those hundred and fifty
tablets back to factories mobile device

118
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,860
management fees it's up there is that we
tried to protect the users from the

119
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,870
suburbs of activity going on around them
as a gift card users have no idea we

120
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,310
have conditioned to a corporate users
whether it's downloading any of the

121
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,959
corporate out certainly be for
productivity in the game is quickest

122
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,959
fastest you can find yes yes yes yes yes
give them access to these devices

123
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,630
we condition them that way from IIT and
now is our time to go back in and see

124
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:25,350
what we can do to fix something that's
so just in this instance what I'd like

125
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,280
to dispel here is that I've been in the
business of it safe to assume that there

126
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,560
is no operating system there today that
any of us know that is extremely 100%

127
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,199
secure there's always a door into these
operating systems so regardless of what

128
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,500
operating system is algeria's web
marketing messaging you're hearing all

129
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,130
these operating systems are vulnerable
some more than others in the case of

130
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,280
Android budget each and every one of
them provide access to it so not only

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,770
have we seen mobile mom we're here
checkpoint but we're also seeing the

132
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,010
consumerization of the mall where where
children live here

133
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:15,930
consumer eyes mobile malware disguised
as monitoring software for your kids but

134
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,449
it's really interesting because if you
look down into their website you can see

135
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,830
where they prominently displayed their
this monitoring software is completely

136
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:34,810
hidden from the user you can pick this
up for up recently 340 wanna give really

137
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,900
sophisticated in the bells and whistles
it's gonna cost about $1000 to imagine

138
00:11:40,900 --> 00:12:05,420
now but you can sideload download to pc
software to this at the pews

139
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:15,120
sometimes indians cannot cash advance
appearing on a more regular basis this

140
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,970
the marketing hype that you're getting
from these manufacturing companies

141
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,580
saying that they did not meet his shoes
this website itself is keeping track of

142
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,460
all the vulnerabilities with this
operating system I cannot tell you how

143
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,390
many times I've areas that have said I
don't think there's a problem everything

144
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,319
within this environment jardin it's a
safe community it's not just the issue

145
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,470
with the actual operating system it's
much more sophisticated that now they're

146
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:54,530
not swayed you time that a company
determines that there is a problem with

147
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,740
the operating system we know they got a
bit out of past to fix it right but

148
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,620
these things are deployed by the
millions worldwide travel news from the

149
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,100
moment the day the problem could try to
push it especially with these mobile

150
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,560
devices they've gotten either put them
through their stores and service this is

151
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,819
where you'll see your post to get the
latest update or in the case of the

152
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,610
Android products they've got to give
those over to the carriers AT&T Verizon

153
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,910
so that they can test it make sure that
nothing breaks in their enterprise with

154
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,980
that new code and then those are pushing
down to the various devices when you're

155
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,460
looking at that gap of a boner ability
that's an own-goal durability that could

156
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,700
be anywhere from three months to 6
months and in some instances but you

157
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,770
never elected to the newer OS's that
Boehner ability of still going on their

158
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,400
devices

159
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:01,100
ok so just on the attacks in the last
year low against regardless of what the

160
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,970
market is these are the target group sex
for you that you're looking at today

161
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:13,260
addition to that checkpoint during black
hat we discovered additional malware

162
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,550
that was uploaded in the Google Play
Store we brought that to market in NYC

163
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,099
everybody what they could do to mitigate
that you see each other software but

164
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,880
it's not just that we're hearing over
and over again all of these connected

165
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,880
devices are connected notes on these
networks right so anytime the security

166
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,260
is not implemented correctly to protect
those handouts

167
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,600
instances work till devices can be
completely brought down to a grinding

168
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:55,230
halt who are we checked with so check
for the ninth consecutive year in a row

169
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,460
has received the highest accolades from
Gardner for having the very best mobile

170
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,190
data protection in the business are now
on we do not have one single competitor

171
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,210
that's been up to discharge as many
years consecutively as we have so when

172
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:20,930
you look at the various companies
referenced 250,000 seeds AT&T runs over

173
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,819
a billion probably up close to
three-quarters of a million devices what

174
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,600
we've created a hard choice helicopters
he does

175
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,170
the good news is to separate known
player we've been in business 20 years

176
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,550
balance sheets are perfect for the one
of the only darlings in the security

177
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,660
industry where we consistently year over
year if we need money and continued to

178
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,130
be good investments right back into our
technology which is rather unique

179
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,569
security space so what we try to do when
we're on the sills is just work with

180
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:56,939
everyone to say things that we could be
doing as I D executives is supported by

181
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,690
the various mobile devices we need the
ability to detect or stop any purchase

182
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,160
activity that's attacking them all the
rise and then we need to implement

183
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,509
strategies educator and users and have a
desk for the new one where it went

184
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:19,190
let's talk about how this kind of them
all so about 2006 2007 when Gardner came

185
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,910
out and said that he was dead

186
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,329
the first thing that happened to that
was companies started toying around with

187
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:29,109
mobile device management and how to
implement it in their enterprise the

188
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,019
problem was that there was data lots
happening so that's where you saw in the

189
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,509
marketplace companies with their
container MobileIron in their containers

190
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,630
but companies realize they had to get
data loss protection for these mobile

191
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,710
devices

192
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,720
but that still wasn't enough so then you
had the other companies like look at

193
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,130
some of the other ones come out with
technologies at least try to go with the

194
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,750
known signatures of antivirus for the
mobile devices however the biggest

195
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:06,550
threat which is known malware that's
created 0 days 0 second and this my

196
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:13,819
friends is what we do extremely well so
what are we doing when we looked at the

197
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,149
security from this side of the device
this we're looking at protecting be

198
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,440
operating system protecting the
application centers news we're also

199
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,750
looking at any network based attacks
have become out to this in the case that

200
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,480
I like to represent everyone is that an
example being if you go to filter the

201
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,960
enemy be tilted in a wifi and then if
you go outside you might be children in

202
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,000
the problem is that not one of us in
this room or dark enterprise license to

203
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,299
use these products one of those two
networks is an evil twin as food twice

204
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:01,520
the good news is we say we protect the
network side were also managing that for

205
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,820
years so how does it work well
essentially

206
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,629
check 21 we'd load into city created
with indeed meet your mobile device

207
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:21,100
management companies which could
actually put out a client to the device

208
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,570
that then climbed just gonna take
snapshots of the operating system

209
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,789
the applications as a download it and
it's gonna watch that works

210
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:40,940
action is triggered it immediately 77023
which is where its notified the

211
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,559
behavioral risk it to start doing the
analytics so this folks if you were to

212
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,678
try to do that on this device it would
run the battery dead almost

213
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,110
instantaneously to do all that heavy
computing power that is needed to really

214
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,658
look at what's going on with this device
so we here at checkpoint in the cloud

215
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:06,470
and running those applications are
activities in our behavioral risk injury

216
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,039
when we do the good news is that we can
do things we can look at things in a

217
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,350
static way you look at a minute dynamic
way so when we're doing that opening of

218
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,480
the applications were looking at things
are is there a time when it is going to

219
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,530
export trade your text messages
incentive to a number you never texted

220
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,899
before his capture screenshots

221
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,860
the screen is already went dark there
soon millions of different combinations

222
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,520
that we know that we've seen in our
community and all of those different

223
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,440
combinations are in our behavioral risk
engine at any point if we see that

224
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:52,900
there's some type of audience

225
00:19:52,900 --> 00:20:00,380
markets since we download to give you
your who were wearing win so that we

226
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,410
reconstruct from a compliance standpoint
but more importantly we also give you

227
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,450
the ability through your MGMT trigger
activities to say if the devices under

228
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,660
the middle attack on a wifi hotspot stop
the connectivity going to the Internet

229
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,610
delivering that took command control and
drought that back to the company's

230
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,129
servers so they can continue to do their
corporate work we can do something like

231
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,690
that

232
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,380
students if it's a delicious at one of
our clients if they do as though notably

233
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,360
notify the device that there's much SAP
on their user has 24 hours to delete

234
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,959
that malicious app if they don't provide
TV DMDM triggers the ability to remove

235
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,750
their access to Active Directory accepts
their access to the device for any court

236
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,480
reduce so those are the things that
we're doing today in the marketplace

237
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,400
pretty amazing what we're doing in the
fact is in terms of battery life on it

238
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,970
only uses about 2 percent of the battery
for the entire day and to have that

239
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,700
level of protection is pretty
sophisticated so each of the three

240
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,300
different sectors of everything that's
taking place that I just talked about

241
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,240
where we're monitoring the apps the
networks and the various holes in all of

242
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,260
this is that we're doing is very
multidimensional we're really looking at

243
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,460
the different behavioral things that are
happening on the devise its previously

244
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:34,530
we've seen instances where some of the
consumer goods where is undetectable so

245
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,309
we open up some of those packages

246
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:44,370
and run them in our class in CQ engines
to really see what it what is really

247
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,279
going on with these various things that
are being downloaded to these devices so

248
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:56,570
we make it as simple as possible so
working with the very soon PM's all that

249
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,809
happens is built a car application of
push it out your devices whether you

250
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:07,820
have 101010 thousand good news is we've
got this deployed pretty and including

251
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,029
up to some of the government agencies
already so it's a nice piece of

252
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:17,490
technology that's very scalable one of
our largest client has over 800,000 see

253
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,610
smoothly additional to that some of the
other questions clients are are they

254
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,820
could be able to see my pictures look at
what the users having their tents

255
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,330
messages and unfortunately not we've
taken the steps the game that we're

256
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,490
watching over you just grabbing metadata

257
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:42,350
we're only watching over changes to the
operating system malicious applications

258
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:49,879
that are happening her so with that said
all of that data is very safe and it's

259
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:57,779
very scalable so educating our users of
the things that we should be doing from

260
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,629
a ninety perspective of the communities
working with the users to say really

261
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:06,408
start taking a little bit more careful
know so that we're not going through and

262
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,789
accepting the terms and conditions for
Mary but in the event you too

263
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:16,799
give you something like this and
technology you need to walk them through

264
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,080
this season the steps that it's going to
do its gonna look after the well being

265
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,519
of any wifi connection to the well-being
of any malicious apps can be downloaded

266
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,229
or it's also gonna watch if there's any
offense really not that often times and

267
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:36,179
I talked with clients to say well what's
the big deal with this reality is that

268
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:45,249
what we see is any time users cannot get
access to the prize is t-mobile's ATT's

269
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:49,019
the world the next thing they always
fight to fall to as the jump partners

270
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,419
WiFi hotspots in the reality is they
just don't know whether they're just

271
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,539
adore interested WiFi hotspots so it
begins at the education process for them

272
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:02,720
or at least having a tool that can help
them if they get into trouble on her own

273
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,099
so that we have to check 20 relative to
our global threat reduction technology

274
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,999
questions from the audience that be
happy to share with you some of the

275
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:18,570
experience of being said I implemented
in had to go back to make changes to

276
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:26,918
help myself

277
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:49,779
applications and network but if you
actually have sensitive data but you

278
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:56,159
need to protect another suite of
technologies it's called gap so did the

279
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,100
case of your question counsel talks and
that's where any document to sit within

280
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,570
the company is a protected document
based upon confidential private

281
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,230
available used for internal and external
partners that sort of stuff its

282
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,220
collection solutions we have known that
can be coupled if you have something

283
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,720
like at around today for data loss
protection it was couple right to work

284
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,010
with any other questions

285
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:37,240
they don't know if it's available to
read here yet the one that I tend to

286
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,890
seek out more often than not but what I
can do is give you my card

287
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:49,430
take your word on that should ask

288
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:58,610
any other questions here to serve the
job search coming out today and check

289
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,070
point you'd like to learn more about our
mobile to a prediction technology please

290
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:15,149
feel free to reach out to your local rep
here myself either one of us come out of

291
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:21,280
your various fields is what we've seen
is just in the last few months alone I

292
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,520
have been on planes trains and buses
working with the number of the CIA goes

293
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,879
throughout the West area and in Canada
yet it's interesting that CIO no but

294
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,130
they need to protect these knows but
it's really interesting because it is

295
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,480
traditionally the PC and they haven't
really looked at the mobile side but

296
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,280
it's what I talked with the mobile
because they know it's a problem because

297
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,990
they're seeing where they'll have
devices a transformer so on and so forth

298
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,790
but they're not talking to him to set a
lot of what we're doing right now is

299
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,020
just getting in front of the marketplace
to say when we meet with the team's is

300
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,330
chiefly good idea to bring in the CIO
mobility teams and bring them all

301
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,949
together so that everybody collectively
working on how we're gonna securities

302
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:15,750
various devices thanks again and have a
great day hugs
