1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,150
soviet deserted how's everyone doing
this morning due to a good my name is

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:20,390
Justin Brown had been previously as of
2010 with him now since insurance

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:32,130
analyst that a large company led all
these things are my own failure freshen

4
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,120
things change over to spend time with my
own resources this year ended December

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:46,390
because employers a meeting where I work
in whenever an undergrad mentioned the

6
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,020
most from your phone systems from Baylor
so rich doctor bond from Reno

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,620
yeah I used to work at that company
regard may or may not have made it plain

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,289
go sideways so I will not answer
questions about that because I'm so

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:13,260
Greece's background on sources tell you
it won't collect which will put reflects

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,270
what's left

11
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,130
so why would collects because we want
their information knowledge and wisdom

12
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,229
is that kind of the word workloads
they've we've gotta listen prison system

13
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,100
through Davis if we have turning
oppression

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:37,610
himself but not over to do then make it
optional tour employers into our

15
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,130
businesses and that becomes system so we
make better decisions so what we collect

16
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,548
all the things previous jobs it was not
uncommon to have mayors of everything

17
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,700
those opposed to the Internet in
particular most of the day sites they do

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:04,819
get watched just by your Regency's but
by various people who work in the fields

19
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,209
there are a number of companies that
actually the social service in

20
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,319
Philadelphia

21
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:18,108
as couldn't tell them to other various
names so where will we go check out some

22
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:23,359
places like Instagram Twitter Facebook
and your favor government records

23
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,599
because they like keeping records on
what you doing where you are in the

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:35,760
world so how do we doing things great
just great stuff we're talking things as

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,700
much as we can go some stuff that we
call with Google for discussions going

26
00:02:43,700 --> 00:03:39,089
to end up being done because he does
have some songs so famous

27
00:03:39,090 --> 00:04:15,710
so because

28
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:53,500
pictures taken by the new locations
around the world

29
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:13,660
to bring about a year ago

30
00:05:13,660 --> 00:06:01,639
colors so few jobs back there

31
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:58,760
will stop when you see the other one

32
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,990
so

33
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,240
name where you work for you

34
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,790
locations from the new have all your
friends who go hey are you working to

35
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,650
corporate now and there's no just as it
was earlier that's the quarterbacks have

36
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:26,530
been done before so they have changed a
little upper logo colors to be there

37
00:07:26,530 --> 00:08:14,840
were several banks just picking on them
just because you can

38
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:59,920
because so so so it's great

39
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:18,870
so you still the task of database you
are the leader you probably have the

40
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,339
password bit of it they censored sex so
it's not about over thinking the problem

41
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,500
or not what you need to move slowly
pushes you have and yes my clients he

42
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:45,050
didn't even when she heard about the
debit card I need a credit card on

43
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,880
Twitter there's a whole Twitter account
that's dedicated to people to see

44
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,420
pictures of their credit cards

45
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:07,839
numbers DVDs everything simple yes this
is the problem

46
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,940
kind of bad news opinions or education
when it comes to securing information

47
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:24,390
because I can pull up multiple times
here's my card thanks dude

48
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,050
comes on after a while it feels like
you're just city

49
00:10:29,050 --> 00:11:30,290
your your plane coming baby seals

50
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:52,750
around because we don't know who the
guys are the same boat as well yeah I

51
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,630
know that but I'm self that with some
other banks and other information that

52
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:11,519
the visitor but by the time we did some
work it took two months or the

53
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,110
government agencies to figure out who's
you need to call on the guy once that he

54
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,230
disappeared for another month when he
came back on he was backed up and having

55
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:31,970
some fun and is busy doing research on
public transit codes on its accessories

56
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:43,040
other types of other other simple 100
some really big so he's been doing some

57
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,610
some profits from various vendors say
thanks for doing your research doing

58
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,220
research in so he's gotten upset

59
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:01,190
to reduce the graph search function in
facebook

60
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:22,780
know how soon do the

61
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:33,550
so tired

62
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:54,060
students

63
00:13:54,060 --> 00:15:37,430
just about everyone

64
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:48,319
should be run on mister ends well and
this is intrinsically voting starts but

65
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,940
just started adding to the website so
this becomes kind of fun to go hard

66
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,410
running new TV

67
00:15:57,410 --> 00:17:46,070
well maybe not

68
00:17:46,070 --> 00:18:04,260
because you can now add to the records
and it's just kind of sad to go to live

69
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:11,280
in a world where they allowed to refuse
to post does it get without application

70
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:19,270
to say hey I'm not know this isn't your
cell

71
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:30,440
Dominic was false and another good news
pretty much set up under pressure on the

72
00:18:30,440 --> 00:19:27,500
net the actually did have a TV

73
00:19:27,500 --> 00:20:09,389
probably don't

74
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:39,529
understand something that somebody
you're probably still have people do and

75
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:47,889
they're very large organization dealing
with millions of it without doing a

76
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:53,668
bunch of peoples information you don't
mind waiting for unit for anyone to come

77
00:20:53,669 --> 00:21:16,740
by I'm going to get students find
passwords a lot actually

78
00:21:16,740 --> 00:23:58,690
Google

79
00:23:58,690 --> 00:25:05,720
thanks

80
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:23,850
and basically going over different like
them to their first then it is pretty

81
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,550
bad even gonna look for one employer I
don't want to cause I'm not gonna fun

82
00:25:31,550 --> 00:26:08,330
stuff i dont wanna know about so when
James

83
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:53,129
that it was just funny music different
things

84
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:00,039
thing because however their second term
he goes on butter which is out of the

85
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,710
house so you have to do some
location-based turning me know when you

86
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,029
make sure you so it does look good in
those jeans delicate little bit

87
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:15,139
differently

88
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:19,389
place after this we worked we're
actually thought he was out of the group

89
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:28,168
so we actually had a bunch of stuff to
walk by you and the more you realized I

90
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:34,100
think that you understand courtesy
better than we do

91
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:42,059
my other side to this is dead but
because of how much we share it might as

92
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:49,730
well be read online research and stuff
about where we are friends with and we

93
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,500
just believe profile about the various
people that work there company

94
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,740
yeah I wanna know the bomb from
accounting to begin to 15 campaign

95
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:08,059
against the weather is predicted people
at work organization helps you build a

96
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:13,260
better phishing schemes better servicing
scheme for deployment that you're doing

97
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,070
internal testing testing you need to do
this because it is the basics and Mike

98
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,419
were kind of how we do this or any other
questions

99
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:37,880
9:30 in the morning I've been up since
330 I can go back to sleep so I'm

100
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:56,370
looking forward to this

101
00:28:56,370 --> 00:30:07,840
to the people who they are

102
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:20,639
sometimes they work together and
McDonald consultant you may only

103
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,950
interfaces with one part of security you
don't interface with the rest of the

104
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,470
security group and you don't really hate
to get this done wonders five other

105
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:35,370
groups that do that but all of the news
information and that'll work for us to

106
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:41,100
do so just kind of in some of the groups
and how much they want to carry out

107
00:30:41,100 --> 00:34:05,260
their help their customers

108
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:24,730
children

109
00:34:24,730 --> 00:37:01,400
but

110
00:37:01,400 --> 00:38:20,520
which one

111
00:38:20,520 --> 00:47:37,100
did they don't like you

112
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,380
questions
