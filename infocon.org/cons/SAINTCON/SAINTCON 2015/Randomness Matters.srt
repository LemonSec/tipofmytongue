few years ago

2
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:48,750
random very random unfortunately it's a
bad idea

3
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,280
ok sam Newman says anyone who considers
a written medical methods of producing

4
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:13,590
random digits in the state of San
generators you can think that you're

5
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,590
getting random this and there's no
really good way to test whether you

6
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,880
really are getting randomness way of
knowing for sure if what you're doing is

7
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:34,239
cryptographically cryptographic all its
generators will pass statistical tests

8
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,730
and I'm not talking about
cryptographically secure random number

9
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:48,850
generators I mean cruiser and I ponder
and whatever else and that's part of the

10
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,870
problem is to get started

11
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,239
truly random number generators are used
white noise they regenerate White House

12
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,420
by a bullfighter signal and then they
kick off the white icing his enemies so

13
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:41,599
what's the problem with cheese actually
based on what is random but this random

14
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,488
but the problem is what about headless
systems for example where it arrives

15
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,530
very very slowly

16
00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:00,260
generators you never helped him we could
be difficult to the case with the

17
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,799
different them

18
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:11,200
missus theoretical example of a
pseudo-random number generator RNG

19
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,450
surrounding number generator

20
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:23,039
generators goodman's compare statistical
tests usually not a very good sources of

21
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:45,810
cryptographic random that's very hard to
test so why is this happening to monitor

22
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,000
down here is not working so we're going
to try to swiftly typing and seeing

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:54,449
comebacks

24
00:05:54,449 --> 00:07:20,849
generated some random numbers we were
able to the next

25
00:07:20,849 --> 00:10:09,379
generators

26
00:10:09,379 --> 00:11:44,529
to produce generating make a difference
that's good

27
00:11:44,529 --> 00:14:10,819
make sure

28
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:26,689
be 140 tests your computer's security
number generators through security holes

29
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:32,289
in and signed up but still it's not
particularly need to use it sound out

30
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:43,189
room to begin with but you need to use a
shin so what are the pitfalls

31
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:55,589
a cryptographically secure stream of
random numbers except how do you see the

32
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:07,139
shooting still isn't becomes the
proceeding to get used to them seated

33
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:13,079
that's one written by a guy named Dana
Jacobson that is sitting around on

34
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:22,359
December 04 truly random number
generator

35
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:44,540
actually see we see and then the same
stream stream so your shirt and then

36
00:15:44,540 --> 00:16:07,010
seed internal say two people could
potentially get the same temporary

37
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:29,600
password every 30 minutes don't do it
don't really see why is this
