1
00:02:32,580 --> 00:03:05,840
never do that again we can never go
walking at DEFCON and black hi welcome

2
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:16,360
everyone have you had a great gone so
sleep-deprived and looking crazy about

3
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,459
this guy up here to help me out because
I need some support in helping + man so

4
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,050
we'll get into who we are here in about
two seconds about us and it's like spicy

5
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,590
I go by the handle dark matter I'm a
hacker hardware and software I've got a

6
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,540
degree in computer science

7
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,420
not about me and he'll I G hardware
everything he just said except the

8
00:03:39,420 --> 00:04:00,850
degree of the pictures of us don't be
evil be careful a lot of different

9
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,079
applications which will also go through
we brought this presentation we actually

10
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,959
ended up using it to question the
challenges here

11
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,230
controlled circumstances but be careful
you're doing

12
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:28,610
don't have your neighbors but we're
gonna talk about how we're watching

13
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,449
things but in the process you'll see
you'll see some things going on here so

14
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,550
let's talk about the objectives so I'm
gonna give you some free 411 primary and

15
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,510
bringing expert in the room just plug
your ears because this can be

16
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,430
embarrassing and I apologize right now
because I just want to give you enough

17
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,789
so that you can understand what I'm
talking about in our analysis so yeah I

18
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,610
just get your ears the next few slide
about the primary having to make it

19
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,699
quick because this isn't about primary
this is about one walking the data that

20
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,770
so we can talk about is the harder you
together we've got the hard work here on

21
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,810
the table

22
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,830
afterwards come up take a look at it we
can talk about it we're also gonna talk

23
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,448
about how we gathered some airwaves
organization techniques how we got to

24
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:20,260
higher levels and then we're gonna do it
we're going to talk about cracking I was

25
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,139
going to do a live demo of trying to
crack WPA but we're having some problems

26
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,720
connecting because about that disk
encrypt their I have a head on it though

27
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,960
I apologize I do like them on that but I
got some screenshots screenshot I can

28
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,469
show you then want you to changes
because what if you do a project like

29
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,410
this always happens you wanna change we
can talk about some lessons learned them

30
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:51,889
wrapped up alright so to begin with it
is to 11 is magic in wireless in general

31
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,410
is magic wakey just worked amazingly so

32
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,440
11 you have frames it's kind of like
you've got layered to communication

33
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,560
between switches in this case their
friends and there's multiple types of

34
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,020
brain you gotta management brain handles
your dedication the Association weekends

35
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,930
there's items that you can see when you
put your list of networks that you can

36
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,190
connect you there is no indication there

37
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,830
their probes reason there's a ton of
just if you're interested in going

38
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,590
deeper on its 11 stands become an expert
on it like wi-fi lose and then you've

39
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,679
got control friends of these are things
that are helping to control when the

40
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,630
device is already connected then you've
got data frames and this is where your

41
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:52,070
payload is where things that we care
about that are higher levels GDP data

42
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,020
frames promise to be quick and dirty so
right we're pretty much done with their

43
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,299
got a cool little better grab you one
thing real quick on how bout that a

44
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,990
reference on the frame because we're
gonna look it's wired shark is the

45
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,340
addresses there's three type of
addresses you've got sometimes it could

46
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,690
be your distribution system address
their source address and then the

47
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,930
destination address those three
different types of addresses and will

48
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,010
see that as we move forward with this
but just keep in mind that those

49
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:31,669
addresses are MAC addresses typically
alright so getting the airwaves are

50
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,479
custom hardware and got a picture of it
up there and I've got it here basically

51
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,970
what we've got is black and I'm running
Debian on it and then I've got to elvis

52
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:50,230
and got out of black which is the
interview you soo 36 NHA which is which

53
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,860
is the there's chips and so that card
it's really good at going into monitor

54
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,500
mode it's half the mood and then you can
also turn into an access point so it's

55
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:09,890
my most favorite plus I may be wrong but
I think it's about 23 GB on its gains as

56
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,500
a really powerful card then I have
another card that PCBs in there and it's

57
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,470
if you look on web sites you'll see it
and there are three units are needed to

58
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,790
11 incarnate screen but it's not it's a
Realtek chipset and it doesn't support

59
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,350
monitor mode with the latest it does
support monument but you can't go into

60
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,820
managed mode so

61
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,100
I needed on there because I wanted to
use wifi is my public and I'll show you

62
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,150
why in just a moment here I wanted to
have this in my backpack control it from

63
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,160
another device and then killed a walk
arounds conference whatever without

64
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,170
anybody knowing that I'm or walking
basically alright so then I've got a

65
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,990
powered USB hub so that's I learned a
lot about car USB hubs in this situation

66
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,760
when we're doing this because some of
them are paraded her very much handsome

67
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,189
we start putting multiple wireless cards
in a setup that repealing 200 million

68
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,900
apps

69
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,340
having problems with power when you
start home from the tower that means you

70
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,190
start to read the rest of your setup and
then in addition there are certain types

71
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,460
of subs that don't work very well with
ARM processors it turns out and will

72
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,160
thanks for the Raspberry Pi forums I got
a bunch of people who are deeply tested

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,290
and its hands are this Belkin one that I
have now in the picture I had an Amazon

74
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,010
one that worked but it was kinda finicky
added 11 it been rock solid ever sent to

75
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,720
its powered I'm plugged directly into a
battery source I can drop to do outside

76
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,620
of that through this hightower powered
USB hub which powers the global black

77
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,480
witch hunt millions and then I've got my
two outfits so it's it's kind of a crazy

78
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,380
set up but it allowed us to have to be
able to walk around a conference for

79
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,880
about ninety nine hours straight without
having to swap the battery or anything

80
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,910
in this picture I was using a battery
pack do is just the simple USB just a

81
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,079
simple USB brick that you can get and
since then I found out of fruit has a

82
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,510
really cool lithium-ion charger where I
can hot swap batteries without as long

83
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,439
as I have the USB cable in without
losing charge the rest of my system so

84
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,090
it even out additional time I just have
to go take a break in the canyons of

85
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:32,780
batteries so I write this picture I hear
I want to kind of as we go through this

86
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,660
we're gonna show some pictures this
picture with us on the way to the

87
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,600
conference had it on the desktop hard
drive so we started things outright buy

88
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
it or capture on from where from
southern Utah

89
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,570
very long to get down to Vegas so data
capture on the drives all rights a whole

90
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,000
lot where why don't you something off
the shelf like wifi pineapple well

91
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,450
before I went to DEFCON I found out
actually there are two radios in the

92
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,500
pineapple have you guys are from there
is wifi pineapples

93
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,310
love you so they have to radios image
guess now I wanted to view Wireless the

94
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,260
wireless communications I want to use
one of the access point and

95
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,810
communicating my laptop for example in
the other one that's acting from that

96
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,979
urge you to the monitor that listening
but I found that the intercommunication

97
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,420
between there was rattled in limited to
about 2 megabits so when you started

98
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,900
monitoring and trying to dump traffic
and I'm trying to live Wireshark it was

99
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,520
just joking was dying to live in n you
get up to a hundred and 50 megabits that

100
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,530
service setup + the Realtek chip on
there is only a two to 11 G because they

101
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,610
put it in there for for a modification
and not necessarily for that type of

102
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,750
setup so I was like well that's why
didn't you just plain awful lot built my

103
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,980
own Briggs is this is gonna be awesome
we're gonna go rock dust and stones

104
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,580
that's waiting use it but then funny
story real quick I went to the wireless

105
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,140
hacking village at DEFCON if you're a
talk by caring kitchen and Sebastian who

106
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,770
are the creators of the wifi pineapple
and I asked him a question during the

107
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,030
Q&A about about that limitation if
they're planning to fix it because it

108
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,699
turns out it's an SPI limitation on the
communication and they said well why

109
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,740
don't you just take the pineapple
include your alpha into the USB port and

110
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,050
I was like you can do that I was
completely blown away because I get that

111
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,490
money into my mind so if you want to use
a pineapple the form factors awesome

112
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,380
this is kind of obnoxious I got a lot of
custom stuff and I definitely

113
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,460
short-circuited playing with this the
pineapple the best way to go and then

114
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,180
you can plug your out there and then you
can do this type of its data only thing

115
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,650
you can do with that is I guess what
multiple them but you can get a powered

116
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,170
hub

117
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,170
we'll be learning curve there so
definitely check out why families

118
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,779
they're amazing

119
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,290
alright so this is the actual layout on
itself this is the convention center

120
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,930
this map you see her as a liaison there
and this is the main areas we were

121
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,920
walking so we did this for all taipei's
the conference we were moving around to

122
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,500
going to the main areas there there's
basically no spot within the convention

123
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:28,600
we didn't we did we went to black hat or
one day when I can find a map of it so

124
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,949
we have a map this is outside the
Convention Centre Georges at the

125
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,910
entrance of it inside a peres committee
with that side which is the show

126
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,010
everybody knows about waiting in this
line trying to get into duck on how

127
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:51,750
crazy that was the result of the places
here that we're looking or why he's so

128
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,899
you can see that there's a lot of public
people in here as long as this was the

129
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:00,990
strip mall shopping so nobody was a
quick Steve Kazee previously had that

130
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,850
kind of the Rio which is kinda hot
distribute out of the way so it was

131
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,560
pretty much just kids in hackers at
depth convos in this year they put us

132
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:17,180
was real people and so things got kinda
interesting group people while she does

133
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,349
know this one is well we just tend to
show you the basic areas we have

134
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,380
returned to stay in the really populated
areas just to see what depalma buildings

135
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:34,420
existed you actually had WiFi Bluetooth
accessible it might take this one ok so

136
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,410
thanks to a good friend of mine he let
me first or second offense Grand

137
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,510
Challenge guys from 11 to 16 of their
cause another supercomputer to DEFCON

138
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,699
and they had security guard in like
nobody got close to it was basically

139
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,189
between me in the front row way that's
as close as you got will they still

140
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,080
friend of mine who let me up close

141
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,820
how is it was hit by walking rig and go
start walking around it and I asked to

142
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,090
connect like no no you're not doing
anything but I got close enough to see

143
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,150
if there is any wireless coming up and
as far as I can tell there was not but

144
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:17,550
that would have been ran to talk a
little bit now about gathering there

145
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,040
with so how you do that i dont wanna go
crazy and depth on giving you guys at

146
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,939
oriole our workshop on how to do it

147
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,850
aircrack in G but you're cracking geez
what I'm gonna talk about going to give

148
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,900
you the basic man just kind of talk
about some of the caveat I ran into you

149
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,240
so starting a monitoring device here Mon
starters really talk on Monday also

150
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,690
anybody that he went to the workshop and
broke down how to break into wireless

151
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:48,840
devices always a good chunk of it which
is pretty good so anyway the airmen nge

152
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,000
to start the wireless into monitor mode
once you get into monitor mode Ryanair

153
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,200
down I love paradigm it's quick and easy
I love using tools are quick and easy

154
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,170
one thing though to note here is that
when you don't specify the channel it's

155
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:11,110
just kind of hops this is like 17 and 10
11 12 and then what's the problem with

156
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,130
that is when you only have one radio and
you've got all these channels and your

157
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:20,130
constantly switching getting a subset of
that data chunk of that rain those

158
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,330
wireless frames that are out there so
we'll talk about that more in a bit but

159
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,540
keep that in mind about that channel
hopping you know you might miss

160
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,890
something cool that's happening then
blasting I know your t-shirt if you guys

161
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,939
used to shark shark so if you've
installed Wireshark it typically will

162
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,860
install teacher also if the command line
tool that allows you to do all the

163
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,440
filters and being that you're doing in
Wireshark but on the fly from the

164
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,390
command line that kinda like TCP down
but he doesn't really work with wireless

165
00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:01,270
rains that each arc will get you that
other supported protocols Wireshark as I

166
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,510
also used t shirt for my analysis
because then you can once you have a

167
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,750
pcap file you can read in that he kept
biology short

168
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,780
and into your analysis from there so
pretty much all the analysis I did was

169
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,530
using his you're alright so sometimes
want to capture things in the background

170
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,930
when we first tried another Vegas and we
have this setup I was happy to plug my

171
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:32,480
laptop and type a bunch of crap and then
like 10 minutes later and then no no not

172
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,200
ready yet not ready admin obviously we
are taking forever and it was painted by

173
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,210
so what do you do when beings need to be
replaced in like your place was very

174
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,790
smart else so that's what I did here so
I just use screens to demonize service

175
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:54,490
put in the background I'm running for
Walker Art Walk sorry that we have an

176
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,790
association to pull back up and running
the command error jump in energy monitor

177
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,860
and then I'm writing it to a file and
that file in this script it's just a

178
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,800
single file I actually modified it since
they both agreed that slide we're likely

179
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,010
keep track of the day and then adding
numbers that way you don't have a way it

180
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,140
doesn't automatically will not over over
right so yeah that was what I did it so

181
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,000
I just kept track of the days a week

182
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,670
alright so this is what it looks like
when you get it running good you should

183
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,510
have output where you've got a society's
paradigm paradigm is pretty cool serene

184
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,710
the you can see what's going on it's
quick and easy it's just a list of

185
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,990
eighties and also how to find
information you want to go too deep into

186
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,900
that right now

187
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,570
alright so we're going to talk about
some animation techniques so there's

188
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,760
different ways do you frame analysis and
Wireshark

189
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,190
like it supports so much stuff and the
problem though is that it's pretty

190
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,340
grueling like when you start getting
into it pretty much my hands at the end

191
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,730
of day it's it's it's flexible and if
you don't know exactly what you're

192
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,690
looking for

193
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,380
it can be really helpful so horribly
time-consuming another thing you can do

194
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,510
is you can get your

195
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:25,700
capture file filtering with what's up to
t their key chart or two shorter skille

196
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:36,690
auto correct rate their speech Arkansas
State be from it still doesn't like Bill

197
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:45,280
Gates escapee if anyone use an iPhone
iPod I guess pipeline of the cave plugin

198
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,580
framework whatever it is I bonding you
can afford to pay the importance of

199
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,210
iPods and then you can answer to my
calendar is it wasn't very pastor vision

200
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,810
these things are excellent when your
criteria is repetitive and you're trying

201
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,230
to do the same type of now this over and
over again for us we're like what we

202
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,790
want to know about our dataset workplace
I know we have defeated how do we do now

203
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,720
it's a weird week which we've never been
an hour too much that you those tools

204
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,550
were using so the problem with with
using something like this

205
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:26,050
out of descriptive achieve shark was
skiing is sometimes it can spell on you

206
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,909
and if you have a very customer
requirements and since we only chapter

207
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,840
deals for a few days we're not doing
recurring it just made sense that the

208
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,620
other day just your analysis work so I
don't always make up statistics for when

209
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,530
I do they're 100% sure this is kind of
the data that we were able to hold why

210
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,500
we're down there on the devices
themselves we wanted to know if you had

211
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,260
to

212
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,610
yes you know what type of devices you
you'd probably say no Apple Android

213
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:06,060
accessories there was accused of places
little bit of a map that shows that was

214
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,139
number 10 was actually there are sales

215
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,540
their wifi AP their wireless within the
hotel itself which we saw that scored a

216
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,409
strong second we were after that you can
see it's grossly endured Android devices

217
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,800
donde Intel Microsoft after that with
individual manufacturers and so this

218
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,830
individual like this unique MAC
addresses that we saw here so this is

219
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,810
pretty surprising to see just that well
full of the devices now the other thing

220
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,770
with the break you mentioned is I was
blown away with the number of access

221
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,920
points hotel had like they have probably
two to three thousand I saw in just our

222
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,730
way we're just crazy than that between
the person down so they use the same as

223
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,490
they're basically the same company as
far as I can tell but again and I never

224
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:10,580
even heard of or so really interesting
information that we found ok so another

225
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,389
cool thing rebound is devices are
vulnerable writer that really crappy

226
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:26,370
okay so anyways what it's trying to show
is that there is a lot of devices that

227
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,709
are asking they're like hey are you my
home wireless network are you home i

228
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,170
know im wireless network are you my home
wireless network so and it turns out

229
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:45,250
that this is really annoying when you're
trying to work next year in the room and

230
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,220
you need while you basically have no
option so I just threw myself into pool

231
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,530
with everybody else do you know the
testing and see what kind of data we're

232
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,879
actually getting back so both my phone
and laptop computers well so just like

233
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,150
it was a stoner blacktop it was like his
phone and laptop or book saying okay

234
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:17,500
next to Starbucks all connected to it
just goes to show you the kind of

235
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,570
security minded a little bit

236
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,980
and yet they're still vulnerabilities
among us so it's specially at the

237
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,670
convent and we did see the Honorable
devices the Karma

238
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,000
theoretically like you talked to some
devices especially Apple nowadays there

239
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,040
like now you can't carbon tax cuts are
you going to use the commenting back

240
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,690
when you explain how it works I'll give
you quick rundown on it so basically

241
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,330
what it is is an access point david says
you're being in the people trying to

242
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,919
connect because your device is leaking
networks that it has connected to in the

243
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,570
past in order to try to see if they're
available so then it was pretty much

244
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,159
used by the wifi pineapple is one of its
first big attacks is it like I do all

245
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,950
these devices will all these access
points for you to connect you so let's

246
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,260
say you're sitting here at donaldson
it's like my home custom wireless

247
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,650
network that's really cool pops up in
your like a.m. connected to it kind of

248
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,220
happened I'm not home so that the
comment

249
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:27,570
alright so something else we saw this
one sucks but you can kind of see the

250
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,810
sum of the corrupted societies we
thought some attacks happening and in

251
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,200
this picture messages about picture
lights are available so you should be

252
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,020
able to get that information check out
but in this picture you can see that so

253
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,700
you can see but then there is that I'm
happy there's some wifi pineapples

254
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,320
you're gonna broadcasting so that's kind
of interesting why would people have

255
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,550
that if they're not probably stating it
back but then right around that

256
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,500
pineapple broadcast is some corrupted a
society so there is a boner bilities

257
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,620
like people test into a box filled all
the time in like just throw just

258
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,739
anything they can intuit does the crap
out of it so obviously people are going

259
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,760
to try to do anything they can enjoy
while it is a DNC that break somebody's

260
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,180
I'll tell you what I've had better
control systems that connect wirelessly

261
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,100
choose something that isn't like ask you
like just the base characters of Askia

262
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,719
particular case in numbers it's freaks
them out so

263
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,960
you can find meetings as well as out of
the box type things and then this page

264
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,470
you don't necessarily have to see the
actual data but just that they're all

265
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,750
the same and there's one key word here
it says the authentication so how many

266
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,900
of you are familiar with the other tax a
couple of you all of you pretty much

267
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,600
hate the idea here is I clearly saw this
somebody doing it if you see one or two

268
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,860
da senior Wireshark it's probably not a
big deal you know maybe its management

269
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,240
of the network of the controller
something happened but when you stretch

270
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,230
this out I think I caught one of the
friends that are cost is like a hundred

271
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,740
and twenty three hundred and twenty on
the screen

272
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,050
clearly something weird going on there
somebody's attacking something alright

273
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:22,550
so that the total number of unique
exercise we saw we were able to capture

274
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:28,290
60 than a hundred and ninety one
individual SSID is that we're trying to

275
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,990
connect to their home wireless their
work while its whatever it may be and we

276
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,730
were going after we were looking to
record that information so I mean to

277
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:57,440
jump over to Wireshark group quick that
we got here basically inside of the info

278
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:15,090
bring over here on the right hand side
has like these

279
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:47,000
was reported and we wanted to see what
the Rings was going to get some test

280
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,130
results are units that we knew were
worried that we knew were looking to

281
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,390
connect to those random networks and
this was the information we were able to

282
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,410
pull from it this is you can scroll
through and just see all these

283
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:06,550
individual home networks RSS IDs got it
right school 24 this was caught in Vegas

284
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,970
I just calm these ladies I take no
responsibility for what we scroll on the

285
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,380
screen real quick here but there might
be some there might be some favorites

286
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,940
that we might see here everyone could
see it ok right to make sure that you

287
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,320
can see it so how is your morning if you
don't want to see things on streets look

288
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,760
down but it kinda funny source frenchie
yeah it's it's very funny some of these

289
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,840
people put on there there's the FBI
surveillance vendor York's that's his

290
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,540
laptop beginning out there I want to
connect back so there's there's a nice

291
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:52,149
yeah oh also make reference inside of
Wireshark the commands are all under the

292
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:59,060
W land at sea and there's also W land
underscore management MTG indeed looks

293
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,260
like we're doing good on time saw
operating out of you couple of filters

294
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,830
there's some really cool cheat sheet
there's only about forty different

295
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,250
commands to go through and troubleshoot
different parts of wireless and I

296
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,370
definitely recommend you guys look those
up because you can find out really need

297
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,899
things about your network helps for
analysis you can look at your broadcast

298
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,930
things from each time point you don't
have to have a certain spectrum analyzer

299
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,020
you have to have a cat

300
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,230
you know captured the interest do it
with peak out and its role in Wireshark

301
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,920
like that's the best thing ever

302
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,060
all right let's see if there's anyone
here scroll down you can see like this

303
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:44,060
we were capturing this we are in range
of bally's where W value then we also

304
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,629
have Paris and they're really close
together so kind of lead over anybody

305
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:57,370
want anything so this one has special
characters like us talking about before

306
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:12,560
where you have here on this billion
cleghorne 11 isn't necessarily like the

307
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,530
purposely put in special characters
there to try to do something but that's

308
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,240
probably because we're channel hopping
we only caught like a subset of the

309
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,060
brains and that was a subset of the
friends and so but some of that a

310
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,030
society got corrupted that process so
that's one of the things that can show

311
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,649
up in in doing that channel hopping is a
society is only being broadcast on that

312
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,650
channel all the time

313
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,660
devices only going to request that on
the certain channel so in this case that

314
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,330
find out why that corruption happen but
in some cases when you look at it and

315
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,810
like there's a ton of special stuff in
like sum like me to try to do an SQL

316
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:05,850
injection into work now you might see
that so just about to go down see

317
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:13,100
there's anything more quill going on
here I had your business free on this is

318
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,090
like 300 to 400 megs of business my
myself and my laptop is a piece of crap

319
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,629
so I big some of these weekends
available of you guys are really really

320
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,490
interested in will filter inserts in
that post them online and watch Motorola

321
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,120
I will make them available to you so hit
me up afterwards and he caps or didn't

322
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,010
happen

323
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:43,280
are a little bit more this fun madness
as ladies have been going out totally

324
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:52,200
not a trap

325
00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:26,140
mister really happy and that was amazing
concern is this conference to the

326
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,130
challenge to help us and we thought it
would yes I know you get scrolling list

327
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:45,550
of what the broadcasting builder and I
apologize moving on the really really

328
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:51,860
really scary parts we got some
handshakes we didn't mean to you we're

329
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,689
just listening know how you guys are
familiar with the WPA handshake process

330
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,570
anybody raise your hands

331
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,750
oh man I'm just not very good explained
it basically it's a chick so like he is

332
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,930
a dream a handshake this has an extra
steps as they give us in accidents in

333
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,180
the same thing happening at layer 2 to
be able to do it but its core pieces for

334
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:19,930
the client and access point in her
community so it's four separate pieces

335
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:25,890
that you have to capture in order to try
to crack that and we caught it and we

336
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:32,270
were jumping spectrum serving time we
jumped at Spectrum jump channels rather

337
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,080
then we're gonna miss it because usually
when the only time you can capture these

338
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,040
is when a device goes to connect to that
encrypted network so it had to be

339
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,290
disconnected and then it's reconnecting

340
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,990
war it's connecting for the first time
so there's attacks but you didn't get

341
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,860
more of this

342
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,899
find more handsome young detect but we
didn't do it we weren't doing anything

343
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,000
offensive I wanted this piece solely
passive we were simply listening

344
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,290
mandalite we caught B's number of
handshakes which is in my opinion was

345
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:12,460
crazy that we got this number of bull
handshakes so what do you do when you

346
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:19,918
get handshakes look at that as I can
actually sorry sorry one thing they

347
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,199
wanted to talk about is going to higher
layers because you know this wireless

348
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,899
stuff and be in a society that up cause
but you know what's the use of it you

349
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:36,610
can get to DVD and get the UDP did so
why are actually has built in decoding

350
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,500
and it's amazing so it will
automatically go through and try to find

351
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,980
any of the data frames and anything is
unencrypted kids you on and that's just

352
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:54,540
sorry unencrypted it will try to decode
those frames can immediately turn those

353
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,180
into TCP and UDP packet that you can
just use Wireshark the search for those

354
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,149
so now one of the nice thing they have
in Wireshark to is let's say you do come

355
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:12,310
across the WPA WPA or wpa2 he actually
plugged into Wireshark and then it will

356
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,940
go ahead and decode those later to
encrypted frames for you and how you can

357
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,880
jump to the higher layers so let's say
you're doing a pen tester your test your

358
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,900
home network and you want to see what's
going on in your wireless network setup

359
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,980
your monitoring rig you already know
your WPA two key right because you're

360
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,070
gonna do it on your own stuff you can
get into art and then gets what it turns

361
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,170
it into like wireless Happyland it's
like a hub unless you have very specific

362
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,600
access point of view Klein isolation
Wireless is like a hug but if you can

363
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,740
hear the radio waves to see those
devices in communicating

364
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,589
so when I first did this I was like oh
my gosh they got back from them so happy

365
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:04,440
finally I can give us more data that had
been missing which is anyways you like

366
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,910
it there are access point to have
creates the new client isolation where

367
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,710
they use to enhance building at the
physical layer so that way you would

368
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,390
never even see it at the layer to layer
level and but you know those love this

369
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,650
university had imagined and some other
big people that what the money was for

370
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,980
the most part you know your home
wireless system have been known to do is

371
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,050
to go home

372
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:33,790
set up a wireless monitoring and just
something I can wirelessly it'll blow

373
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:41,090
your mind if you haven't already done
that before I'm alright so this is the

374
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,460
actual cutting inside of it so for those
headsets themselves this is the hardware

375
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:56,210
side a little deeper into this this is
about we used to have about 40 times is

376
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,580
available to us this is kind of our
mobile version it only takes one power

377
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,119
supply that usually doesn't pop area ask
them

378
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:13,200
3929 TX cards are for you peace are
about 2,500 processors and they're

379
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,750
locked out for their look down through
the thing that you're going to have in

380
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,900
your lab pup things that are just
completely unreasonable

381
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,480
regards to try to track it on a nice
laptop or even a desktop is made easy

382
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,070
with this other parts of it are we just
run minimal risk i three processors also

383
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:35,760
be tried none of that really affects
performance on the overall record so and

384
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,790
then the the software side itself is
Cali one point six and then we're using

385
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:45,980
cash hack it crack so we were gonna try
to do a quick flight demo showing you

386
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,119
how you actually do crack but some
reason I can't get logged in to you I

387
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,609
made it work too hard by cracking some
shock 512 salted has hers were the

388
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:02,150
challenge and now tired and it's ready
for a break

389
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:07,569
that some people attempt to run those
challenges alongside this kind of an

390
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:12,980
evaluation on speed on this unit nicer
newer laptops in i7 with the greeting

391
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:19,299
card will take about probably fifty plus
there is to do what this will do within

392
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:24,160
five or six hours so we were using so
being within the first three or four

393
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,730
estimated time sit for the challenge
that was your own the ball on this

394
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:35,730
machine was 13 hours total we get about
somebody tried to do the same one on

395
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:41,720
their laptops and they were out what
these days and it was it wasn't a

396
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,480
terrible out there wasn't settled in too
many units do I said top-line nice hard

397
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,099
and it just nowhere near the power of
this and like I said this machine as we

398
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,700
normally have double the cards double
the power supplies and that's just for

399
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,399
one year and it's just kind of Unreal be
double that around so when we do run

400
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,319
this under percent on these graphics
cards get their country up to about

401
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:14,940
eighty-five degrees Celsius and there's
nothing you're gonna do about that at

402
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,549
work now that's on the inside

403
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:21,880
retrial if you're running or cycling
this is we were trying to keep things

404
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,450
cooled and we found stuff just run
stable if he'd agree so we're like

405
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,038
whatever still it has to be upstairs in
his office was literally like any other

406
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:40,329
cards usually popular about 95 so we
found they could handle about ninety to

407
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:53,319
ninety two's ok fans will dwarf in pale
as part of a game more than

408
00:39:53,319 --> 00:40:12,589
going back to talk about just regular
hashing there the shy 512 salted hash

409
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:17,279
that we had for the challenge which is a
shadow pile of modern Linux UNIX

410
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:24,359
operating system is much similar to the
WPA handshake the handshake is salted

411
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,308
with the SADC champ rainbow tables that
you can't do precomputed houses on the

412
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:35,829
whole that kind of problematic and soul
because of that it's really slow to

413
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:41,170
attract new reviews you and she so
unless your targeted by the NCAA and

414
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:46,459
you've got some of the limited resources
coming at you with the really long keys

415
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:57,719
so right there is a democrat bill almost
all right let's talk about some future

416
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,519
changes so biggest future changes as I
walked out a few times already today is

417
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:09,640
that we missed rains because of the
spectrum being channeled

418
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,680
channel hopping around we missed a lot
of data we may have lost money she's

419
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,410
being so why not run more radios you can
just plug in more radios listen on all

420
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,420
those different channels I definitely
wanted to at least the minimum of three

421
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,059
or four more radio but then there's a
new challenge each of those gonna be

422
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:31,150
driving about 200 million power now my
entire power setup is gonna change in

423
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,529
we're probably just gonna have to scrap
a car battery back to a car battery to

424
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,969
his back as we walked around the
conference next time you see it so I

425
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:47,849
want to do is capturing other bands so
this set up his hers is specifically for

426
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,509
2.4 gigahertz only you can get some
radios that was the five-yard also we

427
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,729
didn't have that in itself

428
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:59,078
honestly this setup was like a week
before death

429
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,650
together under like you wanted like
catcher stuff at DEFCON 1 to be an

430
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,130
awesome we didn't know we're gonna catch
you know everybody's always like that to

431
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,329
me is scary

432
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,709
wireless network any black at the
wireless carrier's networks ever turn

433
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:14,609
off your way

434
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:23,269
well it's your life and your wife and so
we wanted to confirm that you just know

435
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:27,488
herself we didn't really into what we
find in that it was actually really cool

436
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:34,950
and there's things going on that I want
to do is I wanna jump on and capture a

437
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:44,839
ton more data or other wireless like
using a car at a car at or RTS party as

438
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:52,609
we are with those you can just grab any
part of the spectrum do you have an

439
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:57,538
antenna or basically and then you
decoded on software and so I think we

440
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,289
need to integrate that into this as well
because that definitely did have a

441
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:05,519
wireless scavenger hunts and there are
people just run around the conference

442
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,419
rat like frantic with random weird
channel I saw one person had like an

443
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,199
incentive is as big as they were in
their stripes on hurting each year that

444
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,359
it was it was cool and I'm like we could
really compete in that next year and we

445
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:26,049
had a car were able to get that the
other thing I want to do is hold back

446
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:31,529
real quick on the capture their way is
there some research that it's being done

447
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:35,549
right now on people capturing CDMA

448
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:40,119
they've been doing that for everybody
else man so I don't know the realities

449
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,959
of it I'm not a lawyer but that sounds
interesting to me there's this really

450
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:49,589
cool project called the blade re thats
has support for decoding LTE brains in

451
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:52,930
hardware that doesn't mean that they're
cracking them that just means that it

452
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,229
can process them ambassador you can
process them back with the hacker up I

453
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:01,069
talked to the creators this Michael
Osman and he's like yeah you won't be

454
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:04,339
able to do well to heed as it's
complicated but something like the blade

455
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,589
RAF talks about

456
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:10,109
three or four hundred dollars more than
that one does and so but that did the

457
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:13,578
things that might be something that we
we might be talking about the future

458
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,089
that sounds interesting is a lot of
people at that time were like I'm

459
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:21,700
turning off my wife i turn up I believe
to my cellular I'm fine I'm gonna go

460
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,348
into work I'm doing my work emails
distillers totally awesome but is it

461
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:31,269
really we don't know because the FCC is
like you guys can even like link tags

462
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:37,649
that are you gonna go to jail so i'm
looking lost contact BFF so maybe there

463
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,059
might be a future presentation alright
another thing that we want to do is we

464
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:48,440
want to distribute notes throughout the
conference is a big thing knowing

465
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,910
position was a really big thing because
while we got a lot of course analytics

466
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,629
out of this state oh one of the things
we would have really like to know where

467
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:02,329
were these attacks deployed our where
was the main point what were they really

468
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:08,009
targeting the reverse of that we were
listening to that information we did

469
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:13,069
actually go and find people that were
doing maybe have some interesting

470
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:18,660
conversations or even just say where
were you when we come back packets late

471
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,989
that was cool let's go back there is
regis we didn't know it was hard to

472
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:30,269
correlate these now let's see some other
things to suffer changes ironic view is

473
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,439
live tweet the war walking progress I
set up a Twitter account is like called

474
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,670
deafening roar Walker and actually liked
2 times for the new so much work it

475
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:44,410
wasn't fully automated so that way it
like your locker sweet sounding that way

476
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,989
like people that can only be a good have
like live stream of some of the key caps

477
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:53,219
and so I just got them on ideas like
that and then the biggest one is quite a

478
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:58,440
bit of announces just to get the the
samples are dailies and I wanted to copy

479
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:06,760
because I'm not a day that you get your
busy for you but I can't do it

480
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,080
I'm not very good at it I want one click
button it's like you have all the data

481
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,310
analyzed were you looking you know that
one of the thing is

482
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,279
strategy just more wireless is we only
caught just the smallest footprint at

483
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,530
the conference was walking back it up to
our room outside the conference and we

484
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:32,330
only spent one day in black and it
really was like not really a real day of

485
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:37,450
black actors we went to talks and then
went to the vendor area and then I

486
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:43,250
remember it so we'll be there is a
deadly wanna go there and get a better

487
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:49,040
sampling so we can do a comparison of
black cat vs Sophie wants to sponsor as

488
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,390
the go-to black Dada next year that did
you that analysis there but it's still

489
00:46:53,390 --> 00:47:01,180
jealous share alright so real quick just
wanna go its lesson learned for a time

490
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,169
here

491
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,700
devices are real and they're rampant
they're everywhere so even though your

492
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,439
phone providers like Apple's like now to
fix it now we saw by there are no better

493
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,490
weeding out people still change the
settings to say yes I want to connect

494
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:24,370
the network people are still setting it
up so I guess to counter that what you

495
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,910
do is be cognizant of what's in your
preferred network list and what you're

496
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,850
connecting to you and then turn off your
wifi when you don't need it when you

497
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,930
don't need to be sharing your your SSID
turn it off when you don't need to write

498
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:45,330
mine Bluetooth WiFi attacks you happen
to these places like people are doing in

499
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,670
their free wifi tax could have gone on
here I don't know I wasn't listening on

500
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:55,430
there with heroes doing the ball
challenge but really happen so it's it's

501
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,839
something happen too scary so if your
administrator of wireless network and

502
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,320
you're not capturing frames are
monitoring your network at this level

503
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,690
you don't have controllers they're doing
it for you

504
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,510
deathly invest in some I think this
whole box right here is less than a

505
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,830
hundred bucks invest in something and
100 bucks you can set this up and you

506
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,230
can start doing wireless monitoring in
your network around your business

507
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:24,030
and you can start getting access to that
data another lesson we learned is we

508
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,710
just need to increase the channel that
we captured during this boost fragment

509
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,560
eating so we ended up with capture data
that was about seven gigs of total data

510
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,770
from the I think was five or six days of
total of that only two hundred and

511
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:44,119
thirty actually made it through tree
shark as valid as valid camp capture

512
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,720
data so that just goes to show there is
a ton of stuff that we only had merely

513
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,169
fragmented parts

514
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,390
essentially we had started capturing a
friend like we're gonna change the

515
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:59,400
channel and then anything useful they're
definitely more radios in the future and

516
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,660
position position i think is a huge
factor because knowing where things

517
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,730
where we picked up things or even just
where we were we were doing things I

518
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,480
could be interesting to be pointing out
that thing and you like to see that map

519
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,980
right there we were right there because
this attack happened and then you can

520
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,540
drop proximity of that sort of that
attack happened so working on some ideas

521
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,660
that's really hard because you can't
just integrate GPS so for some reason it

522
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,420
doesn't work in hotels and convention
centers I don't know why something about

523
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:37,430
roofs and finally the last thing is WEP
WPA wpa2 as long as you use in a pretty

524
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:43,480
decent Long Beach Rd it's pretty clear
that the democrats gonna show you was

525
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,619
one of the handshakes we captured i
three rock you added and then I also did

526
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:58,410
a couple of up to 12 characters hurt
while playing 1029 numbers and between

527
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,868
that I felt like six days trying to get
anywhere and it's like ok I'm exhausted

528
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:07,130
and I don't even want to try it and it's
simply too expensive because missus runs

529
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,400
about 1,200 to 1,500 watts

530
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,490
so that's gonna be quite a bit of bugs
finish up my power bill and then I

531
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,540
really didn't care I just wanted the
concept to see if it was something

532
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:26,850
simple so basically that's the moral of
the story if you have any questions for

533
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,740
us about seven minutes

534
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:39,790
looks like yet so he's asking if we've
looked into FPGA for tracking so when we

535
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:46,700
were doing it like when we started
switching to a six and we started we

536
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,490
really wanted to I start learning how to
start doing some apts to do that so how

537
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:58,140
you rank but the price and programming
to be the biggest barrier to entry there

538
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:04,140
so I would love to have my head every
time I've wanted to do a deal for quite

539
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,730
a while but it's one of those things
have got you but yeah that would be

540
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,440
awesome

541
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,020
rumor has it at lunch till they have
like huge banks of FPGA is that the the

542
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,310
user no I don't know never been there if
anyone wants to take me on a tour of

543
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:21,880
those you know anybody I'm glad to go on
that tour so the other thing is due to

544
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,060
kind of lose their resale value to use
for other things and they're kind of

545
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:32,290
always in demand it is always higher and
graphics card so that PGA's

546
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:46,040
different application and just basically
yeah

547
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:53,820
but it's a little bit older we've got
nora 290 axes which does someone like

548
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:59,870
three hundred and ya ought to use it was
kind of a height of everything at 601

549
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:09,660
bill that provided ground right now
maybe 1110 ok we got just a few minutes

550
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:19,290
of questions he went back in for
questioning ok so ok so what are they

551
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:23,580
being the bonus features I want to talk
about is this little guy so the Dec 21

00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:31,850
guys two years ago at a bad time he was
we had bad for a party that we weren't

553
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,770
risk gonna get seen on Twitter one out
but it was my inspiration for this I had

554
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:42,370
this PCB made and then had put the
screen on a running a teensy behind it

555
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:47,089
and then I've got a wireless dongle will
communicate that's the only reason why I

556
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,770
went out the back channel wireless then
I could start walking from my wrist so

557
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,590
if you wanna come up as soon as we are
without official you come see this and

558
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:02,880
then that I wanted to be able to control
its a start my attacks my walk in go

559
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,020
directly from my wrist so that was a
little hard to put together a little

560
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:13,290
bonus check that out of your inner city
and the questions I were gonna call it

561
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,040
thanks guys
