1
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:48,440
get started when i'm dave packard my
work for the University of Utah during

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:01:00,059
the day and I T and at night like to
blow stuff up in the air so that's a

3
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:09,200
hobby and we actually do have
competition was called the drones go out

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,700
and Google that you'll see that we
actually do cage fighting with brooms

5
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:20,950
and it's sort of cool if you do around
people yes there's some rules like you

6
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,270
can't shoot anything nothing explosive
everything has to be self-contained and

7
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,800
you have to play in this is give the
cage but if we fly out like in the west

8
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,479
desert where several hundred yards away
from the rooms in their battle shotgun

9
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:49,260
shells portable nukes whatever you can
put on your craft so so so maybe twenty

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:02:00,880
years yes so I am a proponent of calling
these things UAVs unmanned aerial

11
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,158
vehicles drove me is the great thing
that the military shoots down or shoots

12
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,790
with an unfortunate circumstances that
they need to do that

13
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,220
anything these would be drones and my
classification of the bottom one being

14
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,170
the predator

15
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,630
piloted vehicle things like that

16
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:32,600
my world is a little less crazy and lets
you record the shotgun shells to build

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:40,530
clay Creek modify designing anything
that plays with multiple blades the

18
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,140
reason for that is because I like the
software

19
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,799
engineering that goes behind it physics
that happened the math like you've

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,620
really lost in really critics I'm not
amount to meet her massive level best to

21
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,950
get these kind of situations going on
but I love of flying these things I love

22
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,459
building these things as a matter of
fact have been doing this for six years

23
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,200
and this is the first commercial during
the day

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,929
affects me this is the first commercial
UAV ever purchased an entire year

25
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:26,320
Chinese clone this 3d or solo three are
so low is about $1,000 device video

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,200
handsome about $1,000 devices are
overweight drones rooms these people

27
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,010
UAVs are flying around like that he
dropped the DJI phantom of the

28
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,630
president's front lawn light through
national parks things like that that's

29
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,000
where they teach and here comes into the
sport so this is actually a Chinese

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,019
clone of this thousand dollar to various
in the Chinese clone cost me $125

31
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:59,040
shipped

32
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:24,259
good $125 it's called the Church 720 /
rebranded quantum quantum Note II Nova

33
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:32,570
you know you have to pressure on radio
but about the Chinese owned radio for

34
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:40,610
$49 completely open source software can
reprogram every switch on the face back

35
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,599
in the day when people used to fly
spectrum's for drivers USB types in this

36
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,400
which we did this one thing in this not
only did this one thing in this you know

37
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,370
you'll have so many channels you had
only so many frequencies you going to

38
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,560
what was in the box open source world
came into its own making clones in

39
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,050
eighteen mega chip regular and software
you could make the switches turn left or

40
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:15,110
do a slip or drop a load or whatever you
want to do so very flexible everything I

41
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:27,250
work with the exception of that one is
open source we started out the day we

42
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,380
started out the day with the upper left
they're using a towel curtain rods from

43
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,729
Home Depot that's what my first reaction
attempt where the top turned over so

44
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,979
insecure that lived in a copper compound
and you know it was a couple months

45
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,699
before my waist put two and two together
and figured out that piece of paper was

46
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,860
missing because it was flying she also
didn't notice that the first time I

47
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:04,550
built 15 2010 2011 hadn't taken down the
propeller titles like me to be in the

48
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,660
first time I spend upwards inside the
house when I

49
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,290
family was gone and the propeller shut
up for each input ceiling and embedded

50
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,840
itself in the driveway I didn't have
anything for the latter so there was

51
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:32,369
probably two months of dinner time went
by until someone but the open source

52
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,590
news in the in the commodity of this
this hobby has opened up a lot of crazy

53
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,119
whacko tools this gentleman right here

54
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:57,000
built just for boaters petitions 50
Tories in latin dude in you know it's

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,420
good motor battery hanging down just
like this World Cup here he's using the

56
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,630
exact same flight pressure supply
controller that I need him he's good

57
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,600
enough on one hand to turn the speed of
the motor is up and down and it's got a

58
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,560
joystick does p.m. that he would be
plugged into his transmitter which is

59
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,330
sitting on and then the yellow stuff and
he does but is actually home so we plan

60
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,250
for a hard landing but this thing
actually flew around quite aggressively

61
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,390
on his first flight when you get your
whoever was at the camera

62
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:43,700
produce wife wearing helmet on and you
know this is the second attempt first

63
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,620
attempt to solve someone actually flying
the previous one because I was actually

64
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,630
on top of the blades on top and there
was a time that we all have a disk

65
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:02,630
that's what was this land here why would
you put yourself for those in rpm carbon

66
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,460
fiber stilettos ok so at least I got a
rate is below it

67
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,289
you know this is what open 326 pounds
this thing

68
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:20,339
got a church to support batteries which
will pry suck the life out of your

69
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:30,800
previous but you know one flight 10
minutes so UAB versus drug you know I

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,219
call you these Islip sometimes because
the media has got to go and sell so you

71
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,639
want to fly right we've all gotten a
little cheaper helicopters for Christmas

72
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,610
you know what I straight up and get
sucked into the ceiling where floods I

73
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,279
was a kid

74
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,199
those are not good

75
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,109
corollary these things

76
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,660
anything that uses infrared with a
little chief controller of accounts as

77
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,639
radiowaves up your inside your house is
very sluggish very hard to things like

78
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:15,040
that we do you need to make a jump into
at least $100 $200 I got my kids last

79
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:23,480
year that air hug explore about this is
also a little bit Reuters and cattle

80
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:34,149
trailer next plays very well but here's
the problem of course our government had

81
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,690
to stick their nose into it right
because we have a plethora of a teacher

82
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,339
and tears right people

83
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:49,870
grandbaby lure see models everybody's
dream baby car seat models right

84
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,970
everybody's ramp built something out of
balsa wood you know they've put the put

85
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,860
explosives on a resilient years ago
right but you know you had to be an

86
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:12,360
engineer to do this great nowadays you
can go to Costco a drone taking it right

87
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,680
and then

88
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,050
when you're smart enough obviously you
live in New York in a high rise window

89
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,270
is you know Manhattan parts like 10
hours or so you put a GoPro on it to

90
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,660
identify everything you're doing it out
your window and you don't think of

91
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,339
things like turbulence things about GPS
reflections of the building

92
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:40,959
think you know it's a serious id10t
error and the drunk girls in this case I

93
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:50,229
would call it a holy site of building
walls it's going to head there soon

94
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:59,589
dealers is Bethany promus right so the
FAA stuck its nose in not a big fan of

95
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,839
what they're trying to do but we're
going to talk about it if your

96
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,050
commercial person and you want to fly
into real estate photos spent $4000 and

97
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,260
UAV you know you're not gonna be stupid
about it right now we've got to figure

98
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,680
out a way to control these people who
can buy them at Costco for the FAA in

99
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,810
all the resume came up with a great way
to do this and they announced just

100
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:32,319
recently but they want people to
register their craft they want people

101
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,209
and this is the quote there can be no
accountability if a person breaking the

102
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:45,619
rule in identified

103
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:55,690
so i cant find me why would I put a tag
on my room so they put together a task

104
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:04,029
force and the actor was congress or
somebody on the hills back in 2012 so

105
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,810
we're gonna give you have a huge chunk
of money and we're gonna say ok you need

106
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,359
to regulate the service means you need
to come up with something before the end

107
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:20,360
of 2016 so they wait until two months
before the end of 2002 do something

108
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:29,080
we're gonna do is we're gonna ask all of
you to put this little device I mean

109
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,490
I've heard many ranges of what we're
gonna have some kind of identifiers in

110
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,920
order to make you use it because we're
gonna sell a million and rooms

111
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:53,219
researchers are gonna go out the 31st of
July these things into the side of their

112
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,980
house and you should go to the park

113
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,089
the FAA wants regulated

114
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,220
they face a lot of heat from house to
house transportation subcommittee rights

115
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,100
when issuing rules jumping ahead of this
long time ago

116
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:26,560
2012 in the sort of we get it right now
so that's good and not good

117
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:36,900
this is a interesting video skip through
some of this number since good them as

118
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,010
in this is bad and sayings is really
cool used for this is a gentleman the

119
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,730
real reason she with he actually did
notice you might recognize some of this

120
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,139
year

121
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,859
break down there and that the list is
Pleasant Grove Cemetery /

122
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:58,980
and what he's gonna do he's got a wing
of home win and he's going to make a

123
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:21,160
sixty kilometer tried flying up to mount
Timpanogos

124
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:35,439
controls

125
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:54,540
beautiful baby first person so what are
you wearing goggles he said now chair

126
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,540
and he does what he sees as his funds
crashed right so you got the flag flying

127
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,709
feeling well sure this is a private
person and he said you know I take my

128
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,660
family of everyone's wanna floods
finished work and I fly around the week

129
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:22,410
of dinners and he's like this really
suck it one of these thing and then we

130
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,230
started think and talk about the
importance in ok you know where the

131
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,410
small

132
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,430
we something with that size will be
bigger actually sitting and playing in

133
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:44,329
3d space what Star Wars in 3d space is
going to be like you know my plane its

134
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,600
birds and it doesn't do much you know
unless there's no explosives or

135
00:15:50,600 --> 00:16:00,220
something in the attempt so so it wasn't
really big thing to him and then you

136
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,470
hear on the news here you know JetBlue
Delta is funded a drone claim hundred

137
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:15,140
feet away they have never ever ones
identify the craft identified was

138
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:24,530
murdered or something else and all the
sudden people are flying drones over the

139
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:34,079
airport was a kid that's less

140
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,250
wherever there's never in all these
hundreds and hundreds savings they've

141
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,480
never actually saw identified that it's
a craft that just looks like a little

142
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,860
whitening it was 150 feet over here for
about split second as I was screaming by

143
00:16:50,860 --> 00:17:03,350
sixty miles in their little dubious so
you know not that I want that room to

144
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:09,709
hit a commercial airliner in Figure down
really sucks but we have to figure out

145
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:17,650
what's true what's right so they're
going to require recreational grown-up

146
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,250
operators to register their craft ok
we're gonna try to make some except

147
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,220
exemptions for the little Tory copters
the inside your house that can go both

148
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,770
teams even for the outer destruct but
what they're asking you to do the rumors

149
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:45,650
I've heard as they're asking you to buy
this domain

150
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,100
yes the transition accelerates the
Beacon

151
00:17:51,100 --> 00:18:01,629
black box you can you have the power to
regain your code your ham radio license

152
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,140
name or whatever and every time you're
on the air

153
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:15,160
begin your GPS location and they will
see it on radar or does it look at but

154
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,730
seriously

155
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:25,290
if you know if they're not enforcing it
earned forcing it or the local police

156
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,678
officers were run around the crash that
took off from the ground you have a

157
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:37,120
beacon on know it's a paper airplane
seriously they do have really cool kids

158
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,850
for paper airplanes the remote control
little box with a carbon fiber road

159
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,080
property reproductive performance and
you left and right

160
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,610
really cool paper playing so it's going
to get out in service but it's gonna be

161
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:03,360
ready to be hit with a penalty you fly
without beginning your license ok so how

162
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,199
much is going to cost you know how much
taxes they pay for it and then if I'm

163
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,059
you know testing my backyard requirement
is to have to call the airport 12th plan

164
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:22,580
if you know somebody who works for
vendor the front and I take my own and I

165
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,510
fled in this report we're not supposed
to crash into the side of a magnificent

166
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:45,299
something to do when hear it

167
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:54,080
register hey everybody in this room
where all Utahns reeled him to rate your

168
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,460
$16.00 what you told us and we've
registered oliver weapons ok I get that

169
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,230
you need lessons go fishing you license
I go fly in the park

170
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:16,410
so they're gonna regular troops piece
but it's nearly impossible to find

171
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,120
someone who's unregistered and then he
says only the good guys will register

172
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:31,168
are probably pretty much everything
right so why would we want to register

173
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,980
first of all we gotta ask and they
actually do this

174
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:47,350
others as usual Troyer said in the user
using it may be issued to turning and he

175
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,870
said no it does not have authority to
register recreational drone operators

176
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:59,428
supply aircraft the way less than fifty
pounds and that's what this means

177
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:10,320
anything under 55 pounds forever has
been class-leading threat to the right

178
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,450
but now they want to take things that
weighs less than a pound and regulating

179
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:26,750
things we could start regulating knives
and forks and spoons that you know oh my

180
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,590
gosh let's not talk about model rockets
they don't exist in the parks how many

181
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:43,059
cups gets have put their eyes out on the
water cooler water bottles so he works

182
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,600
at this airport and he's like you know
ok so rude to me

183
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,240
group to manufacture seen rooms and head
near misses you know there's there's

184
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:07,919
pilots do the same they were cruising at
four thousand feet and they saw this

185
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,929
craft at four thousand feet which I
guarantee you it can do I'm gonna tell

186
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,370
you how I know that

187
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,149
it's called crowd surfing and you can
google it when he was not associated

188
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:26,010
with it but under a phantom account you
can get these things above 4,000 feet

189
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,160
but what speed is a plane traveling
especially commercial gym when they hit

190
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,160
for those even be able to see that
differentiated from a pic of cloud

191
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,920
that's what this lawyers and you can't
tell me that you're seeing the four

192
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,010
thousand feet really bad

193
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:58,260
equalizing mice on top of hills so I go
to warn you its next slide you may not

194
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:15,550
want to see so if you don't want to
gross things you can close your eyes she

195
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:33,730
treated small video late Roman or
perhaps trying get pictures of her and

196
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:42,290
her Hollywood home so we're worried
about this person and we're now acting

197
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:50,480
regulation and love in hollywood city
limits no this is not fly three hundred

198
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:59,559
and seventy-five feet spiritually around
any famous person's whole

199
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:18,360
anyways so paparazzi are no longer able
to operate drew intense house such a

200
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:29,289
loss just anybody chains kardashian's
you know anyone inside the city limits

201
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:38,879
of Baylor first appearance if you're on
the bus route

202
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:56,350
drone cannot follow up with the FAA
remind you so back to normal and this

203
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:04,629
this is a sort of clever test uses words
after tea and crumpets the English

204
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:15,439
actually passed a law that's ok look at
this force lawyers hope to use drones to

205
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,869
check for people

206
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,658
helicopter parents have a new term

207
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:32,059
people out to watch their kids walk to
the bus stop them back

208
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:41,178
cool technology don't know if I want to
play around a bunch of kids and American

209
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,909
legislators trying to get all these
privacy issues figured out putting

210
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:53,080
paparazzi grown the whole henna mehendi
Institute in Britain has come out and

211
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,399
said hey you know so far remote control
aircraft can fly in any normal air space

212
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:05,469
and an air space for private use but are
required to stay 150 feet away from

213
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,960
people and buildings and 450 way away
from public assemblies

214
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:21,149
he's here to play my backyard I can go
and take pictures of my neighbors

215
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,860
complained city partner and i cant
flooding your groups of people you know

216
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:35,149
there have been confirmed sightings of
role playing around fires you know and

217
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:40,110
the book the helicopters the coming in
of the pullout

218
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,379
so the things they actually have
photographs of photographers and

219
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:51,890
musicians that come in and take pictures
pictures pictures of helicopter pilot

220
00:26:51,890 --> 00:27:10,049
suspect I didn't hear leads Britain
figured out how to a doctor's note 86

221
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:15,700
12572 $1 K

222
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,039
planes you can put the same play
controller I have my quadcopter Mexico

223
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,320
instead of plain and you can tell it to
do routes to have a friend that he does

224
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,590
rock quarry investigations for people
with aids and in the past

225
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,658
used to go and play all over the world
who would pay $50,000 to a helicopter

226
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,559
pilot and say here's a bunch of GoPro
camera strap on the boat crashed and I

227
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:53,129
want to play this past the quarry and I
want to bring it back within a sovereign

228
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,260
stitches everything together and I'm
gonna tell the quarry operator helmets

229
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,149
rocky money and I'm also gonna give them
a map here's this color crush your your

230
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:06,580
Cisco rockier and have built this week
old rocky R left and all those kind of

231
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,178
stuff and they pay him you know $80,000
for this

232
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:25,889
but to $4,000 lexicon tires and now he's
lies churches was never helicopter pilot

233
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:30,860
a couple of Pelican cases the open legs
everything together because those

234
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:40,879
laptops as in the GPS waypoints and
Cisco going he's now using planes to fly

235
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:46,918
over crops for farmers multiple acres
dozens makers and if you use an infrared

236
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:53,019
camera you can actually tell where you
need certain chemicals were you need to

237
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:58,749
fertilize where certain areas that need
water so instead of getting the tire

238
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:03,830
place they can spot chemical with the
plains to the upload this information

239
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,990
into the big plans the prompt us in the
bells turn on and off and then where

240
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:16,889
they are and what they need a stimulus
Rovers high school guys here

241
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:25,590
russia's little rover these things can
raise around buildings 35 miles an hour

242
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:34,490
obstacles use GPS coordinates cool
things around the house all open source

243
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:43,210
software in use cameras can use the
vision we can use light are ultra sonics

244
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,499
bunch of things and helicopters

245
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:53,119
helicopter pilot guy here right there on
the way she is like helicopters

246
00:29:53,119 --> 00:30:01,889
patrolled 700 + through severe pain in
the butt to fly over trying to figure

247
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:05,549
out of control mode is gonna stop you
and upside down over time

248
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:12,239
if you look at this helicopter this
instead of any normal are similar stuff

249
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:17,019
over where you're coming into a flood
control board which is just like this

250
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:18,029
board right here

251
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:27,379
little $700 $49 and it takes this
machine and she could handle the

252
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:39,850
controls automatic take it out there
toward the normal blood flows forward

253
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:46,738
expect lots left what's right even have
what's called simple mode so when you

254
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:52,429
sign your craft shows have to know where
your noses right let's say I'm a craft

255
00:30:52,429 --> 00:31:00,619
and my eye looks behind his left is
right right turn around and I'm sideways

256
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:07,168
for a base for president left is now
right right left right BA simple mode

257
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:13,659
takes all that out of the equation you
could meet spinning in a circle the

258
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:18,330
control of this way the craft will move
away from here where the nose pointing

259
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:24,710
knows where the GPS location of where I
took off was the software in the math

260
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:39,779
says okay this is where you guys want to
go away from all the men and reruns low

261
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:47,090
take some of the stuff and returns for
London from welcoming

262
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:53,830
I can go up to the top of mountain
really cool place I can take my drawn to

263
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:59,149

year but stick and Rooney a button on my

265
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:12,780
phone crashed goes up to 10 she and then
added a single slice away at a hundred

266
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:18,940
5250 and then flies back to me and land
in the same spot so far more impressive

267
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:27,220
is your boat or beach somewhere I can
pick these drone he's cool technology so

you can buy the Chicago but it's $1000
you can spend over $24

273
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,320
everywhere and everything you need to
fly box looking the better you turn on

274
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,240
the transmitter don't read anything big
red sticker on it as read the book you

275
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,630
don't do that you pull the stick
reviewed the play button me start

light if I get twelve GPS is locked
position here right margin of error

281
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,580
commercial GPS consumers GPS not

291
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:29,550
history in the schools that he can

looking bottom part there that they

293
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,130
didn't tell you it was in there

294
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:50,990
got away so there's time you comin was
in this thing that they scrambled jets

295
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,770
to follow it huh

296
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,570
weather balloon rate I'm sure they're
gonna spend that kind of money to

297
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:18,580
scrimmage it I thought the Patriots
defeated him but

298
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,558
yeah

299
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:29,670
brilliance with a scramble that much
military her to do those things back

300
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:51,849
whether dr. Seuss program that will
lower price so some owners are dealing

301
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:56,589
with issues dealing with them was shot
guns there is a recent case of a

302
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:05,130
neighbor flying over what was supposedly
his own airspace neighbor came out and

303
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:13,739
shot is thrown out of the sky there's a
whole bunch of problems that happened

304
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,670
way before this to get this kind of the
going on because I haven't talked about

305
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,269
that but we went to court

306
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:29,578
kidded houses away thought it was cool
and videotaped it and clearly show that

307
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,609
you're on over the guys house not doing
nothing was no camera on it

308
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:40,558
the judge didn't even look at it the
video games got the shotgun if it's over

309
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:47,509
your house away so now we've got a
president but he didn't have an idea

310
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:57,319
taking on its own really knew who it was
so we got this video

311
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:03,450
this is a vintage room shoulder Rachel

312
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:11,240
simply about global people are actually
but apparently what this does is it

313
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:21,939
takes and Sens slammed Rams clearly see
that rumor there you can see it if you

314
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,020
weigh so how can you to 4,000 be
traveling 60 miles an hour at burger

315
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:34,690
king who is this guy takes this assault
rifle and pointed it just run it

316
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:41,430
commands it to land I believe you could
do something like this but you're not

317
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:49,259
gonna commit to one hundred is gonna
committed to go go go somewhere else

318
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,790
fly back to China so I have yet to see
one actually wind I know they took them

319
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,130
over a desk on this sort of playing with
them that its command and conquer of

320
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,180
slight

321
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:08,009
good you know I think it's an air 1615
trigger on it surely go to show to

322
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:23,510
Grenada Grenada literate their courses a
weather good weather doing so

323
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,010
WS clause whatever

324
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:36,040
bullying created this laser of course
things leaders and you know they

325
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:44,810
actually painted green orange drove over
the Mojave Desert were supposed to be

326
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:51,210
ready and willing pointed this laser at
it for ten to fifteen seconds it was

327
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:59,790
flying because you know four thousand
you can actually see these exams and cut

328
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:09,000
up the tail on fire with the laser
technology in 15 seconds you can do that

329
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,590
so so some kind of apparatus are showing
up at the bottom weather balloons going

330
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:24,030
to take care of us so we really need to
regulate coal people ok so some simple

331
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:40,370
rules for r/c hey don't be done by rooms
for dumb people don't fly near airports

332
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:55,200
don't fly it over or near people listen
couple seconds ago someone you know that

333
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:05,569
five years ago and it's going to be my
craft punch people you guys sex and the

334
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:11,980
front row didn't make it might UAB took
off and Hubbard weather here is fine

335
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,370
until they decide to go full speed right
inside the podium which I was standing

336
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:22,020
on pieces of property for everyone
everywhere so you don't fly near people

337
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,850
that's why I don't play well bring my
little bear hug and we can play that to

338
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:33,990
have a starter with you you know my
spotter is my wife she falls asleep

339
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:41,750
flooding and goggles hey can you see it
no good

340
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,260
thank you Richard

341
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:51,530
check where you fly you really don't
want to fly 2.4 gigahertz radio control

342
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:57,890
device inside a building with two point
for mass of radiation

343
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:06,200
you can do crazy stuff everyday UAB that
you can buy Costco is 2.4 users they get

344
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,290
out to a part was not a hundred wi-fi
access points

345
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:20,020
doing crazy stuff there's one of the
enterprising guys did what was that

346
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,770
challenge on their fault

347
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,200
yeah he was down there and you have
viewed by this little bit sensor we pull

348
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:41,629
this out of his backpack for Surrey has
a small 250 says he plugged it in okay

349
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:48,610
so what we can do certain things because
there was no you didn't scare kids and

350
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:55,860
then we can go play it in got a small
cross-section radar cross-section

351
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,660
display and runs clock threads answer it
was working awesome work and really good

352
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:10,379
crops that the guy but he didn't factor
in a couple things as massive air

353
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,010
blowing down on the switch lapping she
so if you like you know going on the

354
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:23,010
freeway and holding shootout giving
rights excluding its own greg did enough

355
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:28,850
pilot you compensate for that got close
we couldn't say anything cuz you know

356
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:34,890
you have to do this competition is like
a worker so we like clothes West or not

357
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,890
these three guys like their lives in two
rooms

358
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,500
they started flying closely walls of
minutes experience was called turbulence

359
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,270
prop wash ground effects but in this
case as well as fact that he was certain

360
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:53,290
to suck the air down on some turbulence
and IR sensor is a recorder and he was

361
00:43:53,290 --> 00:44:00,690
going over for a run at times we did
what Anybody could do you just ran into

362
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:09,830
the IR sensor in Chicago Cubs it worked
beautifully on my way these are these

363
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:14,740
are what they call the mini quads use a
little drunk racers

364
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:20,350
actually reese's know we had a drone
raised here but two weeks ago and they

365
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:25,569
set up a little less pulls you raised
your in on your cameras in the front of

366
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:34,240
the will of God dole's that's drawn race
really cool to get into and you can put

367
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,080
on your best just in case you used your
brain when you're flying this kind of

368
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,480
stuff it's up in the air could hurt
people and then if you don't have a

369
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,410
brain cramp Facebook

370
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,470
ok

371
00:44:52,470 --> 00:45:03,169
so they become badge that we all have to
think about how you know when you look

372
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,230
it up to change the display right that's
the same exact same chip from

373
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:20,849
accelerometer exact same chick to chick
sexy chip but I use in my voices tell us

374
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:27,280
it's going straight up so there is
everything on this convo edge you need

375
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,510
to be their control joystick to the
school are here where you can actually

376
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:41,369
put the comm badge of a quadcopter pick
up some of these ports on the side of

377
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:48,980
Greece really I to seaports and airports
and you could fly out of trouble for you

378
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:58,500
so instead of buying a slight control
and accurate Comm badge and coasts as

379
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:06,300
the controller first late and I'll give
you one of my quad gutters so that's my

380
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,640
challenge you guys you guys get one of
these flying and I've got to rate its

381
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:24,339
legit homo give you everything you need
to know that you can actually get to

382
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:28,720
another enter a divisive racial and it's
not the same things get the same under

383
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:36,299
the dryer roads with Jason because of
all the technology is a gross word means

384
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:46,010
high school students when you have time
to start doing this kind of crazy spells

385
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,460
we'll never know that there is something
in the ceiling until

386
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,750
last flight has information on it

387
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:02,520
dot com is where I got my start very
open source community software sPB left

388
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,950
is a great place you can get all this
information first person video

389
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:17,348
wide room is another open source
community for the 3d are so low the

390
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:22,970
first commercial you may have to have
open source all the multi copter r/c

391
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:30,000
groups as the Chinese hang up in my
email back and become questions concerns

392
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,500
comments

393
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:39,640
Facebook friends like roads right thats
