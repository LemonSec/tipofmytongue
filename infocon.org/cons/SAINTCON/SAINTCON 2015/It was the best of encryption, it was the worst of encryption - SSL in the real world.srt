1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,139
back he said that's what she said
gentleman mostly gentlemen thanks for

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,428
coming so this is one of the 27 talks
for joining us as well as income this

3
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:21,910
year you miss the other 26 I'll tell you
how many differentiate a minute this is

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,930
not going to be very serious I'm
extremely informal if you disagree or

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,740
one commenter ever feel free all be
available afterwards so don't feel like

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:42,640
you approach me and argue with me about
anything I said so the modus operandi of

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,260
this time she is having a tactical
discussion around us is unless it

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,430
wouldn't mean by that is talked about
how is using organization where we

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,570
encountered in how we're going to
interact with it I'm not going to go

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,850
crazy deep into the cipher
specifications meteorological

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,230
conversation but I wanted to talk about
a few different ways that we encountered

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,639
in today's

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,330
PTI over you how easy or difficult lol
implemented during the SSL handshake

14
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,630
little bit and what's a force me to play
into that then we'll show you ways to

15
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,130
decrypt with Wireshark so there's really
no way this million tutorials this

16
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,130
little talk about both of those can I
also want to touch on enterprise

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,500
description which is where we're doing
wholesale description of a larger

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,420
network once you get through all that
gets on so we're going to talk about how

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,729
you can look at the SL environment that
you have basic testing whatsoever suites

20
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,990
with us all versions are in use at the
bottom of their frequency that i'm gonna

21
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,759
point later pointing out my points and
stuff because in the backseat ok awesome

22
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,350
think you there's a bunch of CLI
commands throughout the talk is a little

23
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,429
cheat sheet at the end it don't worry
about capturing any demands on the GTA

24
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,259
available to you all so it's not like
it's cool anything down the sides of my

25
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:03,820
moves

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:14,019
our two companies some of our customers
to us we're in the valley I'm security

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,520
engineer I spend a lot of time dealing
with network security IPS devices and

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,080
back its jokingly refer to myself as
affected janitor because I clean up

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,400
packets of 2011 live sketch me with
local acts face in Salt Lake City

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,290
underground area of paramount's camp
every year but that also mentor the

31
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:54,170
sands 565 or two courses in a little bit
so yeah so I'm not going to

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,079
differentiate between TLS necessarily
used terms entertained interchangeably

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
they're not the same thing a lot of
vendors use a cell to encompass the

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,890
whole I'll probably do the same through
to talk so let's not be put down a

35
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:20,488
little bit certificates come from 509
world which was still dr 1988 technology

36
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,989
that we're still using today and will we
see you SMS and sell people

37
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,200
automatically think he means it yes well
not exclusively protocols used quite a

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:40,530
bit more HTTPS is one of the most common
use cases and if you are so inclined to

39
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,000
buy a social drinker handgun is
officially 21 years of age you're free

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
to do that

41
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,180
back in 1994 the folks at next gate got
together and they say to work on the

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,820
security protocol indeed it is also one
point no its not on the timeline it

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,790
never truly existed it was insecure from
the start you guys are familiar with SSL

44
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,679
this kind of

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,930
telling of things to come

46
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,859
so we've got two different versions are
current track what we're seeing today is

47
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:17,168
soo 12 is the ratified standard that
goes back to 2008 but pls 13 is in

48
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,650
development is not currently row so as
the centre's move forward there's a lot

49
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,479
of differences between the versions I
could you hold very dry vegetation if

50
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,258
everybody will be going to look at Ben
Stein's the socialist leader has moved

51
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,630
on different back but that's very very
boring and we don't have time for that

52
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,349
you need to know is as we upgrade to the
TLS versions

53
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,169
more support for better authentication
mechanisms better hashing mechanisms and

54
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:54,299
stronger ciphers making for better
picture abilities so first and foremost

55
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,949
I thought it was unfair that hopefully
had the best logo of all of our

56
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:04,990
vulnerability was until I saw the Oprah
herself as she strolled down there in

57
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,990
about her know if you can see that so we
have an ability everybody becomes a choc

58
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:18,960
the old 04 June take it in let sit for a
while so I made those for earlier so

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,859
that I thought were entertaining but I
like this slide not because I created it

60
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,710
because the content until I did the work
with the content the middle was written

61
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,948
by David Holmes IT security week and he
brought up an interesting point is that

62
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:41,500
the CVSS risk scores around as its own
abilities were always indicative of how

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,539
critical vulnerabilities work so he
wrote his own mechanism for scoring

64
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,060
these things and the level is either
godzilla browser or Hello Kitty

65
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,509
essentially what he's saying is impact
times explode ability is his wrist

66
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:08,009
numbers at the top right so what is
hardly do

67
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:13,469
the private key right and that's bad
because with the private key it was in

68
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:20,219
our our sakes exchange mechanism we can
go back and decrypt concessions so it's

69
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,748
a very bad vulnerability in its really
hard to come back I mean you can reach

70
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:27,619
me the server to prevent future issues
but anybody that's got packet captures

71
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:32,819
when that he was in use is now able to
do so he's making that would rid of the

72
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,020
time so this is just an interesting
breakdown of one of the things that we

73
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,229
run into is in Oracle attacker padding
Oracle attack similar poodle breach

74
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,960
essentially with this type of attacks
chip away at the crypto but it may

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,638
require in the in the middle room and
the browser situation which is less

76
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,680
likely in in quite honestly it's just
less of an issue altogether it takes a

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,180
lot longer to get there text another
interesting thing about this table that

78
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,559
I thought is look at the time frame so
these are all major has the abilities in

79
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,270
their own

80
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,568
many of them 2014 2015 we're going back
to 2000 we've really seen the script

81
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:24,999
Hall down last few years and that being
said we've had a salad plate for this is

82
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:28,110
really funny cuz I came at the end of
the last presentation he also had an

83
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,969
exhibit slide show exhibit is making the
rounds here it's a gun but he is exhibit

84
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:38,959
is very meta yo dawg I heard you so we
give you our apps you can wrap it around

85
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,289
the point that is it as a cell is
implemented as a protocol efforts are

86
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,490
trying to clear text protocols are
encapsulated by an association you look

87
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,689
at it over the wire we see the SSL setup
and teardown inside that is the

88
00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:03,479
particles that we know some of those
texts so different implementations in

89
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,279
eSports DRC specify ports but they
really are guidelines I'm sure you guys

90
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,830
in this room have a management interface
and some device in your infrastructure

91
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,899
and probably uses some oddball so we're
gonna see HTTPS traffic going to see

92
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,139
traffic we're gonna see stuff all over
the place but these are the standard

93
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:34,490
ports ok this is my takeaway this is
Jesus point here now this is that we

94
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,430
have in every as a sole TLS session that
you are component we care very much

95
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,609
about the handshake we want to capture
that the allies that and then the

96
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,079
handshake is a session do so every time
we're seeing tlass medication over the

97
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,019
wire essentially there's gonna be a
handshake transaction where the server

98
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,260
and the client are going to make some
sort of agreement on what protocols and

99
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,910
there's going to be a key exchange and
once in the handshake and invade the key

100
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,870
exchange our sessions in progress to the
handshake itself uses asymmetric

101
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,019
cryptography with most of our
transactions for CBS world that's where

102
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,870
r using certificates for the asymmetric
portion into the session data using

103
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,790
symmetric cryptography much less CPU
intensive and the reason that we care

104
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,969
about this is if we're trying to analyze
what's going on this protocol or trying

105
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,130
to decrypt this protocol we need to
capture the handshake we need to

106
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,170
understand you change was used and then
we'll go from there in the session key

107
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,479
and then decrypt the session we don't
need all the session data just some of

108
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:43,990
it so regarding certificates the good ol
the public key infrastructure so this is

109
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,740
state of the art is anybody in here by
shells

110
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:56,410
born before 1988 couple people that are
older than good for you so this is

111
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:02,779
really old tax that's been bolted on to
the certificate world basically the job

112
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,649
of a certificate authority is to take
public key and map it to an entity but

113
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,209
all it does that simple so it's going to
say I've got this mathematical number

114
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,638
gonna sign it too little as an example
of him as a person may be a server may

115
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,959
be in organizations affiliated with its
gonna put its stamp on that and say I

116
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,138
was searching for those two and you
should trust me because I'm a

117
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,720
certificate everything else is a scoping
so we have three types of stimulatory to

118
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,559
encounter we have great and that's your
Verisign your and trust you did assert

119
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:45,240
your GoDaddy if you're broke and
desperate search that's an external

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:53,949
significant downside with an external
certificate trust you don't necessarily

121
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:59,399
control the refining process cost is the
big one right so if you guys work in

122
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,579
environmental you trying to push people
to actually use a cell in the

123
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,969
environment

124
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:12,519
MasterCard on everything because you
don't want to go through time to pay for

125
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,779
this kid expired external CSS and
disadvantages the advantage to an

126
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,160
external Ca is what we're paying for it
is the trust factor we're paying for the

127
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,399
fact that that should automatically be
installed in this receive certificates

128
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,089
tour of every device and play with the
iPad or desktop wallpaper that level of

129
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,649
trust so even if you got caught by
GoDaddy certificate it's signed by go

130
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,929
down to themselves or certificate that's
installed in everybody's different story

131
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,600
so all the devices out there if we don't
need that just across the board we can

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,709
look at their prices to view the thirty
something like Microsoft Certificate

133
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,589
Services right and you could spend it up
in your organization it's gonna be local

134
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,269
organizations to people with the
neighboring businesses they're not gonna

135
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,999
tell us your certificate store you can
define the vetting process you can say

136
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:10,160
here's what you need to go through
before when issues in the instances of

137
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,949
lab worker researcher just spinning of
things for your own purposes you can you

138
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,790
can localize it to your desktop use
OpenSSL

139
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:24,870
certificate server and authority and use
your cell significance this is my very

140
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,150
well constructed example of a civil
authority to hear this out we've got mr

141
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,709
denim junior and he started it at thirty
and Allison Bob from every cryptography

142
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,670
example ever gonna be here and users so
we're gonna make an assumption here and

143
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,240
our assumption is Alice involved already
have denims certificate authority

144
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,570
certificate in their local store charity
trust in addition already has a

145
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:55,370
certificate certificate which you can
see in the bottom it's been silenced so

146
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,810
would like a certificate so what she's
gonna do is used to generate a private

147
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,949
key an apology and the public he goes in
a file that files the certificates and

148
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,210
she's gonna send up and he's gonna look
at that ok is this really Alice caused

149
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,950
by science I'm saying that I believe
it's Alice I'm validating identity or

150
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,150
whatever vetting process is appropriate
some organizations and some of those who

151
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,720
works in the process as anybody in here
ever purchased an Extended Validation

152
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,710
certificate they asked for a blood
typing next that's a more extended

153
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,830
process so he's going to sign that
certificate he's gonna reach are not

154
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,410
back down and now she's gonna present
that certificate if anybody contacting

155
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:52,870
her she needs to make sense to scale the
certificate training so in this instance

156
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,840
for this scale up and out it wouldn't be
practical for every root certificate

157
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,670
issue everything in the world so the
issue of signing a question intermediate

158
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,130
and the intermediate takes over the job
of signing I do any certificates for

159
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,510
endpoints in so at the end we have also
believes the intermediate certificate

160
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,250
authorities signing that but his
certificate is signed by route 31 user

161
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,520
connects to a service that alice is
hosting she presents her certificate and

162
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,790
says it's a marathon junior goes back
here and we also present this

163
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,779
intermediate

164
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,249
uses a this is me and also that sound by
root certificate and the theory is ure

165
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:35,720
trusses root certificate therefore you
trust the change as long as the whole

166
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,079
team is complete so this is a quick
overview of what this looks like in a

167
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,489
browser package Energy com is domain
name just for testing and so we're going

168
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,129
to see that kind of a peer over and over
so in the top of the screen that's not

169
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,829
gonna guess so if I point continues over
here see about the outlook on things

170
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:16,388
that I don't know me know if you guys
over here so this is a certificate

171
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,920
authority at the time I see a package in
order to come so early I spun up an

172
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,540
issue just packaging reduction on
certificates so we see who's issued by

173
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,980
in the center section we have the ticket
info at the bottom we have used your

174
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,399
info now what's interesting is the
browser trust this right so what had to

175
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:42,670
happen for the browser to trusted
certificate authority to be a trusted CA

176
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,990
on this end point and one thing that you
guys may run into is so this is crowned

177
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,319
with the operating systems

178
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:57,809
certificate store if used Firefox
Firefox use various stores thanks goes

179
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:05,579
so you have two places to manage that
relationship so this looks like in one

180
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:15,739
form at just a bit so we see a campfire
bans dance for privacy enhanced mail but

181
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,910
you can delete information on your head
because it doesn't matter if it was a

182
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,379
standard 20 years ago that never took
the cool thing about them is its base 64

183
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:29,899
encoded binary information so in this
it's just basically for the text with

184
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,810
base 64 encoded text we can copy paste
it

185
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,579
we can copy paste it from the web
browser we can copy pasted from the

186
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,940
terminal session if we're already into a
cessation to a fire or something to

187
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,600
binary file we might have to use a
different race now it's a little

188
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,940
difficult to read the text this is 12
commands that will be at the MTG but

189
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,900
what you can see I'm viewing a
certificate using OpenSSL and so it's

190
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,370
taking this blog of texans decoding it
and it's just telling me the extensions

191
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:07,619
in this example here looks like the so
there's a few different file types we

192
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,938
encounter with Certificate Services but
the two common ones are variants of its

193
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,449
either pennant coated with its gonna
look like this and it's going to be

194
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,770
above a text or binary file and it's a
dirty I'll just binary John either way

195
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,389
on the bottom we see using open has to
sell stuff I the rates which for the

196
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,820
file type it's the exact same
certificate filed in where we encounter

197
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,189
the file papers uses moving certificates
from one system to two separate system

198
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,270
so maybe moving out a Windows Server
Windows systems really like to use dirty

199
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,990
they just assume that binary felt
everybody where the open source world

200
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:51,540
tempted to go to the other it's really
just base 64 decode this without the

201
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,080
begins in certificate that you can just
use OpenSSL and again the commands of

202
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,290
energy for you so we're gonna look a
sample application so which one is this

203
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:12,620
where are prices got this many
insecurities but I like it is quick and

204
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:20,178
easy to throw plugins so what's wrong
with this login form it is not grouped

205
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:29,539
in little bit ok so be sure and we got
the ATP POST method

206
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,859
in the packet we see the user and
password which means everybody in

207
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:40,609
between us and that system and look at
the packet is usually impossible so

208
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:47,299
let's take a look at that same system
with a certificate and this is what the

209
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:53,799
session looks like with your so we've
got a three-way handshake at the top so

210
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,609
easy peasy

211
00:18:54,609 --> 00:19:02,439
hello and that's the beginning of the
session now and then we see an alert

212
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
this alert message can actually be
disregarded this is a server hello

213
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,359
messages it's a bunch of messages at
once and then they're going to keep

214
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:16,590
change and we see the application do so
we break it down we go to look at what's

215
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,369
inside the package we see encrypted data
so makes little difference now one thing

216
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:27,849
that people don't understand we're
talking about SSL or TLS we can still

217
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:31,729
learn a fair amount about what's going
on inside traffic even though I can no

218
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,359
longer see the username password but I
can see the source IP the destination IP

219
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,949
source for the destination port I could
see how much traffic went through so if

220
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,330
I see a user actual trading many many
gigs of data and it's a self don't

221
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:50,149
necessarily need to know what the deal
was no probably not ideal so huge the

222
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:54,849
handshake broken down under very
specific to this are gonna change as he

223
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,189
exchange mechanisms change but
essentially just like we found this

224
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:06,109
packet capture the client is the
initiator so start off the conversation

225
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:12,999
it's a US versions of work here is the
spartan ciphers that like to converse

226
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,139
with

227
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:18,418
takes a look at that responses like this
safer sounds good and by the way here's

228
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:24,510
my certificate and key change it
basically depending on what mechanism

229
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,510
the key itself might if it's Orosi he's
gonna be generated from the service it's

230
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,129
a diffie-hellman key chains the key is
generated from General David meaning she

231
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:41,100
could have generated on the fly and that
makes a little bit more difficult

232
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,209
response the client looks at that goes
ok here's my set of keys change and by

233
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,120
the way I'm going to start a
conversation and I'm done

234
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,199
ok sounds good chance I respect I'm
ready to start a conversation in a very

235
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,470
high level example with this diagram is
right out of the car seats if you want

236
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,050
to get crazy but there doesn't
understand every single transaction back

237
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:08,800
and forth I recommend the RFC and maybe
some caffeine this is what just happened

238
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:16,210
essentially what we just as my thesis
2.0 stars of the asymmetric cryptography

239
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,950
reach their session key right now we've
got our session data flow back to

240
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,740
symmetric cryptography less CPU
intensive and we're changing the kitchen

241
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:37,480
do as I respect his behaviour both the
handshake and the session data and

242
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,760
that's what ever about these helpful on
Hulu color boxes horribly color blind

243
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:52,330
can see the difference it's the grand
the dark so this first section here in

244
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,159
this screen shot at a Firefox my
personal preference is looking at this

245
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,680
rate Firefox go backwards the way that
these prospective listed if we look

246
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,530
inside the handshake or looking at a
little bit more like this for some

247
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:15,830
reason chrome just gotta write something
normal free-form versions of this deal

248
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:23,060
us ECD aging so thats elliptical curve
diffie-hellman general davis also

249
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,280
specify or so there's not an RSA key
exchange that are say signing for

250
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,000
authentication purposes

251
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,850
side

252
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:41,570
ok yes and that's the algorithm used 120
ski size de tiendas them load shot 246

253
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:47,678
rushing mechanism for validity of the
data so take away from this is not the

254
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,980
innards of the same respect but I want
you to know that this first part is in

255
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:20,330
the second part is the session deep into
the cipher suites

256
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,480
certain boxes that you have this
offloading will only support certain

257
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,070
specifications and because of the CPU
intensive level of the key changes the

258
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,600
site itself some organizations like
Amazon he did my younger the connection

259
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,230
a little bit because they can get more
connections per box so there's a lot

260
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,730
when you get into the tuning aspect of
it

261
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,090
need to know here is that if you're
playing around in chrome you'll see

262
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,549
something that looks good lets 1 2008
but it's absolutely soaked room in the

263
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,879
documentation actually calls out euless
12 using little curve diffie-hellman

264
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,799
with femoral change and using now this
connection as obsolete was using our

265
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,470
essays the key exchange mechanism we use
our mechanism that results in a

266
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,770
predictable setting session key
generated from the service private key

267
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,700
so if we're able every able to recover
the service private key we can decrypt

268
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,970
every single session when we talk about
diffie-hellman the ephemeral part of it

269
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,640
means that those numbers are changing
everything every session is using a

270
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,640
different set of keys resulting in a
different ways to decrypt it but it's a

271
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,840
little bit more tricky

272
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:54,639
joins is everybody else in the new Miley
issue for sure so there's one next door

273
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,530
please only the second but I talked to
Troy yesterday who's leading the way for

274
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,300
state time with this he is actually
gonna go over a few examples on the

275
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,340
second half of the session so after I'm
finished he's gonna talk about actually

276
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,280
doing this

277
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,590
slides available and you pretty much do
it step by step with what's on here but

278
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,639
it's something you're interested in
wanna play around with us so we look at

279
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,220
the cipher spec use this conversation we
see that it's still a sorry state of

280
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,350
this is actually the RSA key exchange
mechanism which means what it means that

281
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,909
the session he's predictable so we get
that served 52 week and equipped that

282
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:45,990
session vulnerable system you can
extract the private key that way you

283
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,240
know my favorite is auditing systems for
customers they just have a wide open a

284
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,430
file share in their stutterer
certificate next to it to serve as a

285
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:05,080
consultant 75 systems need to keep it so
important so this is really pretty

286
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,510
straightforward guide packet capture now
one thing it's important you need to

287
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,340
have the handshake and the actual
session date so you want to get from the

288
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,740
beginning of the session with a
handshake or you wanna force so if we

289
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,730
going to wash our preferences for the
cell we get this little dialogue we

290
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,470
going to our psyches this we heard that
the only thing notable you're gonna add

291
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,510
the server's IP address and port 443 and
we're going to specify the protocol

292
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:38,980
that's inside the SSL session in the
acct I'm just pointing to the service

293
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,280
private key file looking at her log on

294
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,620
we can tell this was an encrypted
session we see the TLS regular in there

295
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,189
we see our proposed method interests you
proposed method we can see admin

296
00:26:52,190 --> 00:27:03,480
password so that was an article now if
we jump into the diffie-hellman this

297
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,770
works a little bit differently here we
don't have a dependency to have the

298
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,520
service private key defensive you do
have this we're gonna ask for the free

299
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,920
master secrets from the client so the
client will tell us the pre master

300
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,020
secrets were gonna like those from the
browser to a file and will know that

301
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,190
I'll back into Wireshark and wires her
to use the Speedmaster secrets to figure

302
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,480
out what people's so very first thing
start packing catcher and then export

303
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,590
command and we're gonna do export a
subsea love to create an environment

304
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:44,139
variable output it to Chrome or Firefox
sees that variable output all the

305
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,740
session he's very well I could never be
abused so we want to do what we want

306
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,040
less Firefox from the same session and
that's going to make sure that we have

307
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,500
visibility into that environment
variable we're gonna start browsing

308
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,930
around and when I like to do is fire up
another terminal window and then I'll

309
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:08,020
run tale dash and then she shows me the
file being populated so once we go

310
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,600
through this packet capture and then go
back to the screens same spot fires are

311
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,879
quite a sharp left to sell

312
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,470
we're gonna ignore the RSA keys bit and
we're going down here and there during

313
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:26,920
these pre-mature secret log file and now
we can see all rights in this item

314
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:34,740
showings at

315
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,530
in this I was looking at the elliptical
curve diffie-hellman algorithm

316
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:47,030
overseas news so here we see our society
mechanism another key exchange so we see

317
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,629
basically the pressuring us that we're
using ephemeral he's being dynamically

318
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:59,770
change so looking after submission we
see that I have detected somebody

319
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:10,309
logging in to my wordpress site with
username password funny now able when we

320
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:19,070
are talking about the Rockies Rockies
are relying on the server and so great

321
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,580
that was an example for my system that I
host but this is Netflix Netflix login

322
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:32,360
URL HTTPS connection and we can see that
again . com sign into Netflix account

323
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:42,030
password funny hat my apologies to the
pope is that actually has so many

324
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,910
questions on the corruption within the
Sharks to differ common methods

325
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:54,820
different set of policies that make
sense so the next gen firewall this

326
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,250
could be a load balancer there's a
couple different firewalls it can do

327
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,870
this in a few different vendors I'm
gonna give you specific example around

328
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,928
doing this for my work on a lot but it's
not exclusive to that level is really

329
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:12,700
enterprise-level decryption there's two
types of her often and that involves

330
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,770
service equipment so users on the
internet and we want to inspect their

331
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:21,639
traffic before we haven't picked one of
our servers or services were our users

332
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,429
are reaching out to the internet and
they're accessing all sorts of who knows

333
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,500
that we want to decrypt the sessions
making sure there's not too many control

334
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,389
trafficker actual data

335
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:40,478
or whatever so so in the kitchen what we
are doing is we are moving the server's

336
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:45,579
certificate and private key to the
firewall and the fire was gonna stand in

337
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:50,099
between the server and the other users
on the outside little decrease the

338
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:55,339
amount sessions inspector traffic in
then regrouped after the server

339
00:30:55,339 --> 00:31:01,619
variations are often done of this
methodology with load balancers for SSL

340
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,079
offloading I was searching see more of
requirements to actually tripped and

341
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:14,168
then decrypted regrouped just because we
don't want to have sex traffic is

342
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,829
happening here in the reason that's
interesting so use my crappy little

343
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:25,869
Wordpress log on as an example here and
what I did the traffic in tunnel outside

344
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:30,649
network and I fired off a brute-force
logging and so we can see is that the

345
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:35,708
IPS took action it reset both sides of
the connection and it detect the

346
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:40,259
vulnerability specific to the WordPress
login forces it a while a long long and

347
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:46,820
tapping a very short period time would
that have happened without you wouldn't

348
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,799
happen because it's easier to sell the
server over here you go

349
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,459
just broken connection all the way
through only because we decrypted it we

350
00:31:56,459 --> 00:32:01,129
inspected it hey wow that's a lot of ACB
pose the same values and seemed fine I

351
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,718
don't like those conditions

352
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:11,059
TCP reset both sides WordPress blog is
protected little thing we also have a

353
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:17,178
packet capture option here so we have a
packet capture for burglars you can do

354
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:23,969
that by default already looking at the
packet from just have one packet inside

355
00:32:23,969 --> 00:32:28,379
we can just so we can see the username
and password so once again that really

356
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:36,509
trippin luggage admin password is Jeremy
monkeys jumping on the keyboard

357
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:45,179
a little bit different because instead
of moving our certificate for our server

358
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,859
to the firewall the harlan this is since
is going to become the certificate

359
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,309
authority everything users are looking
at the fire was going to decrypt it

360
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:58,320
inspected and then sign it with its
certificate authority and as a back to

361
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,539
the user so what that means is a few
users don't get a lot of invalid

362
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:12,449
certificate messages between us on
Facebook can see that this is the

363
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,879
Facebook certificate in training center
in Menlo Park CA Sports certificate is

364
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:23,428
intact after using it a secret service
we see the issue

365
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:28,669
issuer is a janitor dot com now from the
client's perspective the client trust

366
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,709
this certificate authority so all is
good everything is being the quiet

367
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,779
doesn't notice unless they're inspecting
the certificates on the fly that they're

368
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:41,309
big and they're going is this really the
most points or not there are some

369
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:45,428
protections for adding certificates this
video store but it's you know which

370
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,449
group policy rndm tools it's fairly
trivial to manipulate clients and that's

371
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:57,739
the same example Twitter certificates
intact we see that the issuer is a

372
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,839
congenital dot com and the client
experiences in states that looks exactly

373
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,349
as it would normally you wouldn't know
that taking place unless you inspected

374
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:10,980
the same thing with Wells Fargo right

375
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,559
institution we go ahead we decrypt and
because I'ma see a locally on the box is

376
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,139
his own all is well you don't want to do
that so as this practice we don't really

377
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,510
want to decrypt financial information or
healthcare information was

378
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,230
really interesting used to put a
liability as infrastructure owners

379
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:43,300
potentially having a lot more sensitive
certificate any have a clue what that is

380
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,860
yeah it's the bomb right to predict
painting is essentially the concept of

381
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:55,040
saying I'm not necessarily worried about
see their whatever I'm gonna say this is

382
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,509
a certificate I expect a hard-coded my
application so if you present me

383
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,310
something else I'm gonna blow up a
network because this is the only

384
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,430
certificate so good example of this is
the Dropbox we called the sick line the

385
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:14,569
actual Dropbox sync agent so not the web
inner space program that you would stop

386
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:21,290
and so in this instance we see that we
have our association quite low service

387
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,120
although some cases we did you get back
I'll that's not cool

388
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:36,210
amount fatal and let's look at the
specific error message so here we can

389
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,210
see signed by Funkagenda certificate
this job market even get a peer review I

390
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,440
can we see package in order so that was
the CSS that's where it's the actual

391
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:54,120
error message

392
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:02,380
training in use around that is we know
what drop boxes we know what drop boxes

393
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:09,310
servers are we know what to look for
that application

394
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:15,380
testing as a sell the first point i
think is the most important are using

395
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,670
SSL TLS where we should there are a lot
of network services out there that

396
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,940
transmit more information that should be
just thrown all over the network so one

397
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,040
thing to look at is what i text
information flowing second question do

398
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,550
you support strong ciphers so yes it's
over and we're using modern appropriate

399
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:43,990
in Cyprus we selected is that is strong
as we need to be questioned whether PTI

400
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,189
deployment certainly good for finicky
little things they have expiration dates

401
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:53,440
and they have tendencies with chains and
sometimes they have host names that

402
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,250
don't match the name people are using to
connect the device to want to check all

403
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,270
the six because what we don't know is we
don't want to culture with their users

404
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,009
where they open up their browser to get
the big certificate warning screen and

405
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:12,930
then click that's what we want to avoid
so for some basic testing just scoping

406
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,620
things out in your network we can use
and net tak SP just look at services his

407
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,770
move quick service audit on a system
there's a lot of tools do this but this

408
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,680
is a good free one attack because just
list of services that are running and we

409
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,730
can see here that we've got two
different held up instances into your

410
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:35,950
reports using a cell phone now it's down
a little deeper and STS itself so to

411
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:46,129
tools to do that anybody ever used
either of those ok so we have a couple

412
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,370
scripts scripts that we can kick off the
SSL cert script will pull the script

413
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:56,190
down I'm sorry that you're difficult
down and the SOE num- script ciphers

414
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:03,430
supported ciphers essentially these
tools are doing very similar tests I

415
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:08,180
prefer SSL scans included in Cali to the
source for us I like you just get that

416
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,480
uses color

417
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,330
ur it's easier to read and look at all
the roads safer than those who read

418
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,100
using bad only got some yellow yellow is
OK

419
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,240
should look at that no greensboro is
there some green of their vulnerable

420
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:36,540
that we can specify any ports is not
tied in reports so we can throw it at

421
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,640
whichever service if he wants if we want
to test the question was what else can

422
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,529
you non-standard ports yeah we can point
it out like 63 64 3269 whatever which

423
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,050
are the hell that best serve reports
whatever in city funds you methodologies

424
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,780
used to use nmap

425
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:58,880
for services using SSL and then go back
either within or with an SL skin and

426
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,160
testers instances in make sure they're
using secure versions make sure that if

427
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,399
you have availability management program
you have a large-scale vulnerability

428
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,940
management tool like a necessary and
expose they will do all this for you and

429
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:19,250
automated pretty reports he has that so
here's a couple of days now

430
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,490
public-facing they're facing internet
this is a great sites are trustworthy

431
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:29,069
internet or is partially funded by koala
see a bunch of money at this but one

432
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:34,460
thing they threw out of that school is
the SL labs testing new so if you go to

433
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,750
show through the Internet dorgan you
look at the cell poles essentially what

434
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:43,710
this bar graph in this little pipes are
they took the Alexa top one million

435
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,690
websites in of their the ground all the
SSL instances they took a hundred and

436
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,540
forty-three thousand of those and they
tested on a regular basis

437
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,440
group that just smattering that simple
across the internet they found that

438
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,720
about 30% have acceptable facing so
there's a lot of people not doing so

439
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,279
great with their SSL deployments in
either their deployments are behind the

440
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,880
times

441
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,539
their sporting some really old times
that are negotiating we say so let's go

442
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:19,299
ahead and tell you that looks like
throwing a domain that the domain of my

443
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:31,609
employer which I'm sure they gave me
permission to do so we see support

444
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:39,690
protocol protocol is not supported well
we saw how supported on the bottom we

445
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,069
see that three is not supported
incidentally we know there's a sultry is

446
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:51,470
not supported because Windows XP so
great a strong cipher suite good for

447
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,598
specified so it's a quick easy test in
this is free and available for web

448
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,470
applications

449
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,089
the bad news is it doesn't work great
for internal cost them out things like

450
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:06,308
LDAP etcetera but for outside public
places tough it's quick easy testing one

451
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:12,160
side of town that they do have the wall
of shame by default

452
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,009
you're not gonna wind up on the wall of
shame this little box is checked just

453
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:19,619
make sure it stays that way I'm not
really sure if somebody doesn't like

454
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,549
these folks in assisting them in in
putting them on the wall just don't like

455
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:30,259
themselves I don't really know but let's
look at one of the better so this

456
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:34,230
particular host got in and it was a
bunch of different vulnerabilities

457
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:42,829
essentially the biggest issues we were
very very weak and it's also using our

458
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:49,619
c4 and so there's a FedEx this may have
been a deliberate choice they might have

459
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:54,390
decided hey I think this is University
of Phoenix and after maybe they have a

460
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:01,930
TV program we can sign up for and they
decided that they're gonna go through

461
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,669
just to say we need to support Windows
XP

462
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,990
maybe they have all kinds of the kids go
to school maybe they have a projector

463
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:32,939
issues i don't realize that I promise
you guys this is essentially OpenSSL

464
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,960
comment in here this is a tough
encounter all the time this stuff I want

465
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,380
to share with people converting file
formats is something we've run into a

466
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,010
lot of removing certificates around
between two separate systems level IPS

467
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,880
etc I also set up this year with
openness and basic commands and

468
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,360
basically means I welcome any feedback
you there's anything interesting you

469
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,130
wanna see all added to this can be
available later today up on Salvador and

470
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:07,190
I know it'll be in conflict with you so
many questions on his stuff for me yes

471
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:32,670
sir

472
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,920
right to the question was around using
PSO loading and that's what limitations

473
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,549
we see particularly with the security
appliance in that section is I didn't

474
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:47,930
really touch on this lovely decrypt with
the Palo Alto word angry the key

475
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,450
exchange Dr SE in essentially what
happens in that his senses if you don't

476
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:58,410
use the RSA key exchange mechanism to
decrypt it because it since using p.m.

477
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,520
that's so yeah there are instances where
you have to carefully architect that if

478
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,349
you want to have the strongest possible
encryption but then also used to capture

479
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:32,560
devices within your architecture

480
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,870
questions and OCSP OCSP stapling an OCSP
has to do with certificate validity

481
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:44,109
checking yeah and see if you can toss
the path in basically providing

482
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,580
illegitimate OCSP response and you do
not have a couple different conditions

483
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,620
going on there but yeah that's a
completely legitimate point if you don't

484
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,759
have a serious piece

485
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,790
enabled on your device which is a little
tricky essentially you could mendel OCSP

486
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,960
part which doesn't allow the server to
validate the lady whether or not it's

487
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,730
been revoked and so you could be
indicating with a revoked certificate

488
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,450
you wanna talk more about that

489
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,600
Moxie marlys Fike as talks here by
tomorrow's bike hits that way better

490
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,330
than I ever could but he talks about
specifically the OCSP issues in a bunch

491
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:35,850
of other trustees using PKI in general
so yeah greatly appreciated
