1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,860
of scanning prickly and thanks for
coming out this morning that they have

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,900
what i think is a fun project something
that I enjoy quite a bit and a program

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,159
called cyber majored in Jason would
actually penetration tester security is

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:33,260
my background is that of a system
administrator so a lot of time you know

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,519
being a bouncer bounce back when Windows
and Unix having a good time responding

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,930
to outages and although and obviously
I'm involved in cyber preachers I work

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:01:03,610
with her begins from probably 11 to 18
and kind of a fun experience so

8
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,870
one of the first things that I always
get when you start talking about cyber

9
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:15,310
picture what the heck is a cyber
preachers and why doesn't however what

10
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,340
is that this was actually an exchange
account on Twitter earlier this month I

11
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,080
made it somebody was complaining about
the use of cyber too much for one that

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,520
was debates about it and I made the
comments again to make significant

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,070
slowed why do we talk later this month
about cyber picture and I got this

14
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,460
response what is really what this every
page readers an airport sponsored

15
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,250
program that is designed to teach high
school middle school and actually this

16
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,259
year they they've extended it down to
enter school about program for an

17
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:58,130
elementary school kids the tease him
about computers computer security

18
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,710
difficulty buries the only injury school
bids

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:12,370
did you know much lighter experience and
insecurity than the older kids

20
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,900
but the idea behind this is really to
get kids interested in computers

21
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:26,010
computer security and if not that kind
of STEM education and just get him

22
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,798
interested and engaged the kids I'm
working with right now have all kinds of

23
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:38,299
different insurance some of them were
really into the idea of what they just

24
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,409
loved beating up on so so excited to
have their hands on the keyboard at all

25
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,890
times you've got a couple of kids you
know I would describe as animals in that

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,048
regard

27
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,579
setting up winning servers and in turn
around in the second of Active Directory

28
00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:01,000
domain or something rather Linux servers
or laptops too many changes that you

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,250
walked in that was just happened over
the weekends from last time we met so

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:14,150
Tuesday when when did this happen what
are you doing down to kids who they're

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,980
just interests you know one one of my
kids wants to do video game programmer

32
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,429
at school and the him just the
opportunity to work with the gym the

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,519
kids stuff like down and learn about
computers in general is what he's hoping

34
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:39,450
so it's a lot of backgrounds there and
what they're interested in every page

35
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,129
regarding starnes around 2009 was the
first season and they actually have the

36
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,970
set up in a competition format

37
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,260
the ideas they give them broken systems
that secured like to capture the flag

38
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,489
for blue sea really assists the nearest
analogy I given and it started out with

39
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,720
just a high school hasn't started out
with a small amount of program with

40
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:15,310
maybe ten schools and expanded out for
now I think this is this year's season

41
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:22,060
aids that we started the guts of things
and I haven't worked with yet

42
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:29,530
air force Association cyber dance week
one type of experience that you can come

43
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,359
over the summer

44
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,880
sounds like something I would like to
try out but I haven't yet and now this

45
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,610
year they've like I said they've
extended this down to elementary school

46
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,390
kids get more of an experienced here's
how we used computers here's how we do

47
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:54,289
this here's how we stay out of trouble
on why not be soon start talking to my

48
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:02,360
new friends who may or may not be that
way so that's fairly new to really

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,340
describe the idea here is that the air
force and other companies that are

50
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,880
sponsoring asleep and say hey we've got
an issue that we need to get people

51
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,139
interested so that they can rekindle his
wife for jobs that we're going to be

52
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:28,930
so that's kind of their in their
interests in several pages so now what

53
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:39,969
time is my time that I have cyber of my
previous line answer was 55 should

54
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:48,310
adhere to launch was joking around with
Kevin Howard one of the guys here and he

55
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,629
was elated about be used about his job
to job title which include cyber in it

56
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:05,110
and I so well my presentation you gonna
have your fill of cyber for a month but

57
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,900
why do we use cyber so much well to be
honest with you is just because it's

58
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,669
literally sponsors they've cited that
that's the term so you know like it or

59
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:24,409
not forgetting communicate with them
that's that's what it is so I guess

60
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:30,849
there's competition that's involved with
us and we start out with its season it's

61
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,789
really kind of interesting stories we
have some kids are coming back from the

62
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:39,339
previous year and we've got some who you
know they know how to get on with their

63
00:06:39,339 --> 00:07:14,090
video games

64
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,789
getting them to understand hey here's
how you use the computer system beyond

65
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,860
just firing up whatever program you want
to mess around with here's how you made

66
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,540
your work and they when we had our
competitions which we're actually coming

67
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,540
up on our first one here in about two
weeks

68
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:44,740
14 the teams get basically a downwardly
coaches get a link to pull down some

69
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:53,450
virtual machines and all those virtual
machines they figured terribly they've

70
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,229
done things running on her acting as
back doors so you may see neck

71
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:07,419
girl script or whatever I'll turn on
things like tell the other nonsense and

72
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,109
the idea behind it

73
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,380
the premise behind it is a guide you
have been hired to take care of us

74
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,760
company's network and you want then they
want to do some with security now

75
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,320
they're doing they got some problems
there were its massive improvement go

76
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,150
and so they give you these machines are
they also give you some requirements

77
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,838
around them to where you know these
people were authorized users these

78
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,240
people are drawn or actually stay with
the operators are you figure out what

79
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,180
your mission should they have on the
system works have too much too many too

80
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,890
much access the system and other
services that need to stay up throughout

81
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,449
the competition

82
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:01,870
to do that they have what they call
their scores on running on each system

83
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,970
and when they start up the PM's to get
prompted for their identity

84
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,250
team has a unique identifier so they put
in their hash it connects back to

85
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:22,630
scoring server over the internet and
checks in and now every time they make a

86
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,980
change this partisan you're watching

87
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,210
reacting to what they've done so they do
leads for example a user that shouldn't

88
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:41,240
have been they lose points they take a
check on the Linux box as they set on

89
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,750
fire while the block in and it was
supposed to stay up because of the

90
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,460
company's web server lose points if they
turn off health ins and that was

91
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,740
supposed to be there is no road access
they get points regarding your policy

92
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,930
you know this is automatically happening
and they actually get some feedback on

93
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,660
that there is a web page at May accident
slowed believe it is giving them their

94
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,270
school or as this happens there's
several different divisions inside the

95
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,949
pool

96
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,070
several major competition we've got sore
all service division that's aimed at

97
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:28,700
Jared's agency Civil Air Patrol is the
group's leader focus on some kind of

98
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,800
military experience now we have the open
division opened vision is any school in

99
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:43,040
a group and even school right a group
can get together for most teams ina and

100
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,920
participate without having to join it to
some ROTC squadron we go through a month

101
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,189
multiple rounds the way the season
progresses it's designed to kind of

102
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:03,670
bring them along a learning curve so we
start out with virtual machines I think

103
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:11,829
the Junior High School does this year
one virtual machine for their first and

104
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,490
so they start working with that the next
round three virtual machines and for the

105
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,360
high school kids they start adding
insult questions around Cisco networking

106
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,770
and so we have to start teaching them
how to configure routers which is things

107
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,579
like that

108
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,420
the next round them but they they they
boosted up a little bit more they're

109
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,520
always changing the operating system so
it was competition you've got Windows 7

110
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,030
and Windows aids of the next one year
deal with Windows Server 2008 and

111
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:52,020
excitement something else entirely
different Linux Linux distribution sales

112
00:11:52,020 --> 00:12:00,160
increased a big 2012 systems
requirements that it has but in that the

113
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,560
by the third round of high school kids
are now using packet tracer which is a

114
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,140
simulator and Cisco banks where you can
drag in routers my bag next console each

115
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:20,040
router and set up all the boards instead
of security controls and it looks like

116
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:27,270
pounds and have to save that file and
upload them submit for grading later so

117
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,650
that's that's always interesting to
watch the kids they've been very focused

118
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:38,140
on Windows and Linux because thats vast
majority of the other score and then you

119
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,870
know we start heading into networking so
so the kids really dive into that others

120
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,560
are not very noticeable they've added
what they call a forensics component I

121
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,459
always hesitate when I use the term
forensics in this case but typically

122
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,810
what's going on is they have some kind
of questions that need answers so we

123
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:06,979
were doing a practice round with the
teams that I work with my actually work

124
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:17,840
with about 20 27 kids that were forward
and one of the questions was always play

125
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,930
these things up with the username so
what's the address the question was

126
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,439
what's the name of the movie the Tony
start down there on this Linux plans and

127
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,330
so they're hunting around now there's a
readme files says by the way this work

128
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,390
machine as opposed to the movies or
music or any other stuff on these

129
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:45,630
machines they gotta find out as well and
so they have to look at that forensics

130
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,250
question

131
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,800
find out what the name of the file is
put into a text file but scoreboard is

132
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,449
checking and get it right then it check
census yet they've answered that

133
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,550
question correctly the forensics
component can be kind of fun though

134
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,449
because they sample which turned out to
be a comic on video

135
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:15,000
the kids sometimes will skip checking
the the forensics questions burgers and

136
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,090
they're running through their doing so
yeah we'll get to those later and they

137
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:25,170
delete the comic-con video that say and
I'm finally they get around to check in

138
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:32,209
the brand's a text file I realized oh
crap I don't know what the name of that

139
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,170
was it's gone

140
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:44,510
well I do like the guys you take the hit
that's what you say so it's kind of

141
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,560
interesting in that regard

142
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,420
watching trying to figure out which were
to do things in the practice rounds were

143
00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:00,660
trying to push along on what we're gonna
make sense but you get into competition

144
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,829
that kinda goes out the window sometimes
and competitions will we do that for six

145
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,949
hours long in the way that works as a
give us three days that you can be doing

146
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,109
so we don't want the person she is going
to set up on its own but we haven't

147
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:22,820
fired him up yet and once he said we can
use our party or something on Sunday or

148
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,930
Saturday between whatever well we
typically meets Saturdays about nine

149
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,439
o'clock in the morning works machines we
put our house in it so he put the

150
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,180
hashtag clock starts ticking the entire
team whether we fire up 13 machines

151
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:45,130
you've got six hours from the starting
point and there in the competition you

152
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:52,240
know first managers and coaches for all
and we have to sit here and just kind of

153
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,370
spectators and watch TV help them out
with something where they have an

154
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,070
underlying issue that occurs maybe with
one of their laptops running VMWare or

155
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,980
what have you been that's really all we
can do and you'll sit there watching the

156
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,079
first couple hours and this blast last
year they start doing us we do it again

157
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,269
this year where every time you get
something right

158
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,800
you have the sound

159
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,040
mario brothers as he went into the black
hole again this is the level of

160
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,120
competition that's all you hear is Mario
finishing a love for about an hour and a

161
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,130
half

162
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:39,010
papers on them then we have two hours of
dead silence as far as that goes and the

163
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,310
kids are getting really frustrated and
so you gotta watch how they handle the

164
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:51,599
pressure and six hours sounds terribly
long time but we use it every single

165
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:00,740
time up to the bell so it's a little bit
of a kick it with their the rounds we

166
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,900
start out with a couple of different
rounds the way it works is junior this

167
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,290
is from high school junior high school
is a bit different to the high school

168
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,409
students I surrounded two rounds and so
in this case that's gonna be beginning

169
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:21,410
of November December and depending on
how you doin those two rounds determines

170
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,339
whether or not you qualify for two
different tears over two year olds here

171
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:33,899
is cold sores on track for national
silver is now is out for nationals but

172
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,090
there are continuing to compete against
each other they can get to see who's

173
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,110
gonna win states to their individual
saves and then prepare they go on as

174
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:52,139
we're competing for reading and seeing
how they're doing that again as they do

175
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,360
this for whittling down who's got their
chances of making internationals

176
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,350
and by the time we're done we have
Nationals April this year and page

177
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,189
repays for the team and one of their
coaches to fly out to washington BC for

178
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,500
a weekend where they actually do kids
and they have the two-time Air Force

179
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:23,950
JROTC genes to top three Army Navy and
civil air patrol in the small service

180
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,780
division is how they range that they
have the top teams from the open

181
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,559
division come and compete as well they
don't compete against each other but

182
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,860
they're they're doing the same junior
high school they don't you can see there

183
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:50,209
were none

184
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,670
and something the kids really enjoyed
getting up Benedict who were showing him

185
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,590
stuff around easy Northrop Grumman's a
big sponsor of them so they're showing

186
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,280
you know given them to her as they have
their competition dinner all kinds of

187
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:12,540
fun stuff with the kids are they get
really excited about that so you have a

188
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,200
search for hacker on the Internet she's
always been there in the body and one

189
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,640
way it was actually from last year
during competition looked up to see how

190
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,590
the one of the two doing what is a
seventh grader house ignoring or pound

191
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:39,310
away at keyboards slump down just going
out and and this was later on in the

192
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:46,220
competition series pressure in the
competitions just never know what you're

193
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:53,010
going to see some new one of things it's
really interesting each year is your

194
00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:03,170
picnics and the kids you're interested
in what's going on

195
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,060
they're pushing their encouraging the
automatic with accompaniment leader

196
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:13,639
amongst all the other soon speakers they
know how to make this thing goes every

197
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,130
time you hear yelling for him to come
over and help them out with something or

198
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:27,520
what how you really get interested in
specific areas so one of the students

199
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,160
really like the Cisco networking and
also focus on now my first year the

200
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,640
stove into a literally well we had
another 15 others rather who are really

201
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:50,680
insist they actually freaked out if you
have a Windows iam do is this ok I've

202
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,510
got a seventh-grader this year down I
don't know what his parents are doing

203
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:05,660
what he's all over the keyboard loves
working on Linux and he's got a lot to

204
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:12,140
learn but for a seventh grader I'm
really excited about seeing you know her

205
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,210
grandson where he goes to really fun
things about this program is it start

206
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,740
out with a group of kids in obviously
we're gonna lose some each year to

207
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:29,070
graduation you get the sea of
progression what they're interested in

208
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:35,450
and how they improve how they grow up
one of my

209
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,399
right now begins this year I was a mind
reader last year and you couldn't get

210
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:47,389
him to sit still for five minutes he's
incredibly talented you know it does

211
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:54,090
really well into the debris in Active
Directory domains are we building

212
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,049
systems makes you know Linux on getting
them set up to it vindicates the

213
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:06,510
repository and stuff like that but the
first year then we could not i mean he

214
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:13,240
would wander around the classroom nice
that we're banks this year he settled

215
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:23,500
down for next year I expect so by the
time he gets told traders should be

216
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,750
interesting to see where he goes so we
have an interesting relationship between

217
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:39,409
the coaches or managers and the students
competitors like you said you were in

218
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,659
competition we can't open them and it
kills you sometimes you're looking over

219
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,200
their shoulder just

220
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:57,659
use almost can't say any thing and it's
really hard sometimes to keep your mouth

221
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,730
shut and keep your hands off the kids
during competition but you know during

222
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,559
practice we have we have a really pretty
good time there are a lot of fun to

223
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,260
interact with you never know what you're
gonna get out my first year involved

224
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,250
with it we have one of the students that
he was always asking about the stuff he

225
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,500
was downloading and games he was playing
and no luck with computers completely

226
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,600
compromised I need to reinstall because
I downloaded this game over tutorial

227
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:39,139
knows what I got on it but a chance to
finish reading this game and didn't know

228
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:46,729
you feel that you know the system reform
and read some not so I actually be ok

229
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:54,480
just don't do that on any versions of
the game

230
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,559
the bounds of how we break into
different names of its know that I do

231
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,990
penetration testing my job is to taxes
and so those are asking questions about

232
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:12,809
yeah some really talked about back to
watch some of the kids you know we will

233
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:18,910
I walk a little bit of line because we
teach them to defend against a subject

234
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:28,040
to explain what it is they're defending
against what's the problem

235
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:35,830
let's say you're not having a panic
can't walk out of your system or what's

236
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:43,750
the problem with this time against
passwords and they usually have to talk

237
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,980
about how this health counselor to the
ground coming into town at the same time

238
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,040
here for some sponsors don't want us how
to do that they don't want to buy tools

239
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:04,690
a show to go for this so for me at least
I have to to be a little careful in what

240
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,150
I say because I get excited

241
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,670
here's what you do this you know what is
web app here so we can show you have a

242
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:20,980
website but you know our our job is
really to just teaching the basics and

243
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,320
hopefully see sounds of the point that
they start teaching each other's his get

244
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,409
more experience you find it one who are
older and have done this for a while

245
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,679
are now the ones you're trying to some
hail you to go seven practice and get

246
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:42,740
them started to walk through setting up
an exactly what we don't act like

247
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,830
basically the checklist of things that
they're gonna run you approximately

248
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,570
one-quarter down so they remember what
they're doing they don't miss steps it's

249
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,050
a work with other teams or the newer
students and help them create their

250
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,070
attack so you really start depending on
when you get a lot of fun babe Annika

251
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:14,300
wants to know what time do you know what
i mean that you're already but he knew

252
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,270
what I stop by the time I met him and so
he was asking me about stuff right here

253
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:29,010
how do I and custom firmware Android to
buy so don't back down his big things

254
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,650
you want to strip this thing down so you
got some use resources available to

255
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:42,140
establish so it really varies how we
interact with is just depending on their

256
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:50,230
insurance now we do how some resources
available to us as part of the program

257
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,080
one of the things we get us once
prepared presentations by side

258
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,220
refrigerator so if you want to start out
at team which is kind of a daunting task

259
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,050
in some ways what do I need to cover you
know what do we need to do to prepare

260
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,389
them to compete with a bunch of
presentations of BRT how so

261
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:22,070
torrance some of these presentations I
will totally well I'm teaching the kids

262
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,290
because they'll do things like my
favorite is probably the palace words

263
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:37,330
that start out you know this is a really
bad password 1234 ABCD 1234 a tiny bit

264
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,860
better but it's still more durable than
they get to the point where hey we've

265
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,559
got this nice long braids but they were
moved everything they make it into their

266
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:52,360
/ password 12 characters or whatever it
is I start since ok see this is what

267
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,000
they're saying a strong password news
but he's used the sentence that was up

268
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,679
above that much better off and it's easy
to remember because it's got symbols all

269
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:10,060
through it and it was right to screw up
some of the stuff they bring up

270
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:16,659
look at you go well that's nice for
madness compliance perspective but

271
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:24,600
whatever but at least that gives us
going Microsoft has actually set up to

272
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,000
where it needs of the teams get access
to transport which is analyzed in this

273
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,300
light so we have to do it

274
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:44,790
operating system applications and stuff
like that we can set up for them to get

275
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:51,110
them experience and so what I started
doing like with white seen this year

276
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,540
Sorenson media gave us a bunch of old
servers the old servers and disk space

277
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,670
training they had they were using
anymore we broke up with his 2008 on a

278
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,910
label hyper-v rule using her
street-smart license and now when I set

279
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:17,170
up practice images the ends that you'd
like to use images or premiums but so

280
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,810
now instead of trying to companies
around the laptop's USB sticks which

281
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:27,090
takes every time you do this and their
problems on some system I bring these

282
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,730
things up and say okay here's your SSH
access access via remote desktop go and

283
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,820
it's really easy for you know years 1
p.m. when we create more copies of that

284
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,939
colonel

285
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:50,990
figure and now it seems wrong to the
racism and 15 minutes so it's 39

286
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:58,220
to have that kind of research grants
cisco has said that everybody gets

287
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,980
access to the network account so they
have all of their their training

288
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:09,880
materials found or were like seeing a
kind of it's not completely this back

289
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,380
regularly but so what of information and
get something where they set up for

290
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:22,429
hours which is why I know how to plug
them in and what they're doing and it's

291
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:28,890
really whatever you can put together so
you have to just think about you know

292
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,600
they were there was showing up in
competition practice images and stuff

293
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,490
like that and then we make a practice
the animals running loose on that

294
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,880
earlier this month I gave the kids each
year one thing that they can always do

295
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,220
it right now there's some kind of back
toward the end which is really important

296
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,850
to find because when you go to Nationals
actually have a red team attacking

297
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:01,750
system that you're trying too hard
they're at least find someone nice to

298
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,940
the high school and stuff like that but
you've got to get rid of these back

299
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,420
doors were great team is going to dive
in and start messing with internal

300
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:20,920
firewall back off again changing
policies on your toes was so I created a

301
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:27,070
practice that had three different when I
called back to worse they needed to find

302
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,220
that was all it was

303
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:36,169
so I had to tell them running on it only
gets found that really sounds I had set

304
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:45,690
up basically starting at boot and so
that fired but was running and i think i

305
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:52,260
suck down on some some random high port
but at least then they could see the C&C

306
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:58,490
done txt running and then I actually set
up which are better service

307
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,840
persistence on system so that was
actually running under the services MCI

308
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,559
when those bonds so it's a little bit
harder to find but you must do things

309
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:18,059
like the port numbers 31 337 hopefully
we'll catch the ride but the exercise

310
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,649
there was a we struggle every year on
the back doors every competition

311
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,030
here's a set of separate don't focus on
anything else nothing else matters just

312
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:33,500
find the back doors just an example of
how you can put things together put

313
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,940
together some practice and you can also
use really whatever software tools you

314
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:46,809
can freely available for sale to also

315
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:54,740
you know going out and I don't know
plugging it into you you're really into

316
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:01,960
tripwire throwing down a you know he's a
compliance standard on to it but that's

317
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:10,249
not allowed some of the forensics but
they ask you can use any commercial

318
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:20,129
forensic 2013 something the other teams
would have access to as well but there

319
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,100
is an issue with that because when you
go to Nationals

320
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,498
he makes up to the Nationals you are
married what you can bring in so

321
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:35,570
dependent on the idea of hey I got my
shell scripts God's power tools ready to

322
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,009
go its gonna run their industrial
bridges knock out a ton of stuff and I

323
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:45,249
can focus on the last ten percent of
stuff going to find when you go to

324
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:52,279
Nationals you can't do that you can take
many electronic media drive DVD that

325
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:58,019
united with all your scripts on it down
so you did they have to know what

326
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:04,899
they're doing with them so they don't
want to get too dependent on the goal is

327
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:09,609
to educate behind it rammed into a
competition framework and everybody

328
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:13,500
wants to end its to learn new stuff

329
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:21,560
some things I usually get out about this
one

330
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,460
you know people start asking about the
terminology why is it so I repeat do you

331
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:35,320
know what that's a very nationalistic
sentiment may even been handled it like

332
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,550
well you know sponsored by the Air Force
what you write

333
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:51,590
and national focused organization
doesn't require you to put together a

334
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,520
team under a charity seeger

335
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,930
got the open service division said you
could get six kids in your neighborhood

336
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,419
who wanted to do this and you can
compete it's fine I just need a coach to

337
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:14,330
sponsor them go through the process and
help them all military focus on in the

338
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,759
program

339
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:24,770
honestly really don't see very much
about it all I work with seeing set down

340
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,370
the road here in Riverdale Road Utah
military academy military focus charter

341
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,350
school college prep school so we have a
lot of that has to do with the school

342
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:44,049
cyber picture I have no military
background and all you know come in for

343
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:53,010
permission to get in here I don't care
about that after school guys come on do

344
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:58,410
we teach them to have my son no we can't
do that that's actually part of what the

345
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,890
airport sellers we have to agree to
teach them how to have once the season's

346
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,390
over however will you things like that

347
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,759
weather has a capital offense of boat
this capture the flag for high school

348
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,610
students will go down then some butt out
of these cyber Patriots

349
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:26,020
why don't we teach them to hand over her
right now we're going to teach kids how

350
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,950
to go run around and compromised
websites or system or whatever and

351
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:40,439
they're gonna go hog wild have a couple
of other might be a lot of enthusiasm

352
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,630
and they build build build 'em before
they came how much time with much of my

353
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:53,260
time is it gonna take down the fence so
when I got involved in cyber picture

354
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:00,230
archives working with it said he I'm
working with a civil air patrol squadron

355
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:07,410
which I had never heard of before that
they have this program every page

356
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,350
computer Syrians kind of cool stuff like
down to check it out if you're

357
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:18,460
interested in volunteering now his case
his team doesn't need very much for

358
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,430
these simple and very much in very much
so does take a whole lot of his time

359
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:32,120
between the time I work with the
school's principal is very into this was

360
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,009
a Clearfield high school is the ROTC
instructor there and major workman has

361
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:44,339
had a couple of teams go to him back
there is no major

362
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:56,288
ok so clear so high went to Nationals
have several bands and then have won

363
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:04,109
every time but they've won nationals as
I he's very focused into that so I'm

364
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:08,960
there Tuesday and Thursday nights for an
hour and a half each time and then have

365
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,809
a six hours turned on petitions we can
take up a lot of time to take up a lot

366
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:18,630
of time with your bird building images
of them to practice on what's really

367
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,069
kind of up to you if you want to start a
team it's actually pretty

368
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:29,099
straightforward you USI per page read or
go to the registration process and you

369
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:35,569
don't need a ton of stuff it's Stephen
countdown six members man you can have

370
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:40,190
side competing at any time in the sixth
one is an alternate then we found that

371
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:47,140
useful because typically by hour and a
half somebody's brain is mush and

372
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,160
they're useless and they're getting
frustrated with smashed and so you pull

373
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,868
them out and or they will usually doing
pull themselves out the alternate sets

374
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:02,569
in and takes over their spawn for the
remainder is also nice if somebody can

375
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:11,549
make it for some reason so few students
you need to have the minimum to students

376
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:16,690
whose team are junior high school team
several times did when I shoot with to

377
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,150
do

378
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,920
which did get awkward when they had
three virtual machines to work with but

379
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,150
you can do it that way you need a few
laptops and they need to have enough

380
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:34,980
memory and Howard 22 least one of the
year so no minimum more is better to be

381
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,349
displayed as a sophomore forward to some
kind of reliable internet access said

382
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:44,079
this could be a problem if you're
working at his home when we were at

383
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,779
Clearfield my favorite or systems we
were using were not allowed on the

384
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:56,119
school's network and it didn't have
access to what's going on and check down

385
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,950
so that was a bit of a problem them
something we had to be aware

386
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:05,799
fortunately H&E actually sponsors
several patrons in defense team asked

387
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:12,619
for it they will send out wireless card
so that you can use your competition

388
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:20,670
they do put the restrictions on it but
this is only 45 per page you're going to

389
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:29,789
be watching movies or whatever but it is
it is a way to doing it is some costing

390
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:35,730
me probably where there is less
distractions

391
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,400
distractions as possible as we need to
get their attention was drawn to you

392
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,710
certain about here's how we can serve a
firewall and here's how individuals are

393
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:59,710
this and the other to their site ok sure
but we need some kind of place to meet

394
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:07,770
where they get together and then
practice can he said it's gonna be in

395
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:18,240
time but it's a good time in my opinion
well as I have a blast working with so

396
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,580
there's a high school section where I
served now working with several pictures

397
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:31,730
I put it out there has to be a mentor
when I registered I didn't have a team

398
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:41,800
and anybody who was doing it out and got
very quickly for gun with

399
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,710
we are in there he had another true
there which was great because I had no

400
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:53,960
idea what I was doing and how this
program words and worse here and we have

401
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,270
a group of about 10 kids never take but
I we're done about seven who were active

402
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,180
who were competing and

403
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,290
as the year went along we started out
kind of slow we did ok thanks friend was

404
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:14,420
alright a little bit better but around
the team really stepped it up and they

405
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,500
actually qualify for nationals

406
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,970
so they included EC this picture here is
actually from the stage really liked

407
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,598
your page

408
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,040
the good teams competing

409
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:40,460
there's some cool experiences for people
recognize the guys they found paper

410
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,910
rounds to look in on the competition see
how they're doing a really funny story

411
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,970
about this business sitting here working
away the system he doesn't know the

412
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,379
skies over to shoulder right now he is
focused on starting the competition is

413
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:03,079
just sat down and so he is he was pretty
tunnel vision and all of a sudden

414
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:10,290
general proud tradition older sets so
you talking to the hackers startles I

415
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:22,558
know I'm just trying to login and write
back snubs and walks away from him this

416
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,480
really rattled a kid's Katie

417
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,619
I liked every time I see the age I like
to pull that out and throw it out of a

418
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,740
kind of time watching turned red as I
didn't know blue was so afterwards major

419
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:46,700
workman comes up you know that was no I
was a previous secretary of state but

420
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:53,669
they get a lot of exposure and it is
fairly night for about her former

421
00:43:53,670 --> 00:44:01,230
Secretary of State and general coming to
check things out once a competition is

422
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:06,880
over and done all their tours and stuff
like that they have their own their

423
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,180
words dinner so here's the team just
before they were certainly go to taking

424
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:20,520
pictures of each team everybody's dress
up in their best and lo and behold one

425
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:29,450
national championship was the team I was
first working and so pretty cool to

426
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,580
watch that happen no I wasn't there I
had this thing called work and told me

427
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:39,790
that I had to be an insight into client
somewhere else so I didn't get most of

428
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,560
the kids now in this picture

429
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:51,820
graduated the tool on the right hand
side were seniors of it was a really

430
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,830
good experience for them and they really
do it one of the things that I found it

431
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,880
works good when you set up a team if you
want to find some

432
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,500
is interested in the day to be the
leader and I still big-league Naveed

433
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,620
everybody's going to gravitate to the
kid with the most technical ability

434
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,460
those things that just gonna pull that
direction

435
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:23,440
hopefully not only technically down here
she's not likely but now but mature

436
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,610
enough to actually run against
assignments and try to keep things order

437
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,770
to really fortunate and and a team that
won Nationals we had two seniors who

438
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,350
really get it down one of the things
that I have found this is difficult

439
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,069
nowhere near you I'm a working with a
larger group of kids in junior high

440
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:48,560
school is bouncing the different needs
between junior high school and high

441
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,790
school junior high school kids say just
how much shorter attention spans ordered

442
00:45:53,790 --> 00:46:00,730
from the bogus we also found sometimes
whose great less hard wearing and

443
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:06,960
internet access available in Clearfield
team when I was with them we had no

444
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,540
sense computers admin scavenge together
I managed to raise money and get a

445
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:15,980
couple of other line through the laptops
W solely for cyber history and they were

446
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,910
very focused when they're in the
classroom next year you tell military

447
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,029
academy started we had a number of
computer system and we didn't tell the

448
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:31,100
kids very quickly shut the screens log
out yet on connecting but your phone

449
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,600
down because it was just too distracting
so sometimes you know you have to work

450
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:52,299
to try to focus and none of them

451
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,430
something

452
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:01,259
percent yearly selfish reasons it's nice
to get away from work where you're

453
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:07,690
dealing with projects that are due
reports he'd be written stuff like that

454
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:13,140
and do some where everybody is really
excited as you cheat on their energy

455
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:20,890
their enthusiastic this is all new to
him and amazing and what you take for

456
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:37,629
granted is is not a look at it as to why
I do this where do I start down but I

457
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:44,339
didn't know very much and I had folks
who came along and help me and this is

458
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:51,339
kind of my way in a knowledge of those
guys who run me long time helping the

459
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:55,859
students go home and you can really make
a difference in in some of these kids

460
00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:09,490
lines couple of examples he gave was my
first year a countenance is now at the

461
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,689
University you tom was a really good
student I don't want to take any credit

462
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:20,220
for anything can be accomplished but it
was a medical student got is the you

463
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,399
hear on the scholarships together that
this college is paid for I didn't do

464
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,200
that through an ROTC scholarship that
even though he was in the urgency but he

465
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,710
was able to use some of this is
experience that helped him get those

466
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,430
scholarship

467
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:41,470
two internships North the group one is a
high schools and weaknesses internship

468
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,879
because of northern province of managing
pretty good we put you on stuff

469
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,740
breaking what she thought was a pretty
good and candid and now he's working

470
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,569
during development while he's going
through knowledge as well we have shaped

471
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:04,000
from last year it was our team captain
rusher in one of the kids who won a

472
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,079
couple years ago we were states and he's
been able to in high school was working

473
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,430
in like see the company as a part-time
job that beats the heck out of what

474
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:24,710
numbers and he got his start his
experience in cyber pagers and working

475
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,079
with the other students and bouncing
ideas on something you really can make a

476
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,670
difference in the lives we got something
like seeing now that you know had a

477
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,680
bright future ahead of him I'm excited
to see how they how they develop and

478
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,328
grow so

479
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:46,459
if you have any interest in doing
something like this is a great program

480
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:52,469
yes there's some verbiage that we have
to swallow adverse to use the word cyber

481
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:57,249
you have to deal with that as it's there
but it's a great program and it's a lot

482
00:49:57,249 --> 00:49:57,919
of fun

483
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:08,719
the competition as a black the
enthusiasm is totally refreshing you

484
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:11,660
know it helps meeting not good

485
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,769
overloaded and so do you have any
interest in doing and I finally

486

wives and they say you're paid back to

487
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:30,430

489
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:47,830
no sir

490
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,549
so they do have an official curriculum
when they start out you know hey this is

491
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,080
what security is confidentiality of the
building and energy and all that other

492
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,009
good stuff we start talking about
Windows fundamentals this is where you

493
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,600
can bigger firewall is where the hell
does so we start getting into Linux

494
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,799
basics then from there he did a
mandatory in the operating system starts

495
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:19,780
opening up just general products do we
deviate from the curriculum yes because

496
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,450
it takes a certain point one the
creation of boring now there's things we

497
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:31,230
need to cover and they're just gonna be
boring but it is boring and to start

498
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:37,480
adding on to invest in getting a more
information on trying to get my hands on

the keyboard every week as much as Han
Hui and so they're actually doing

500
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:51,820
something going there

501
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,220
