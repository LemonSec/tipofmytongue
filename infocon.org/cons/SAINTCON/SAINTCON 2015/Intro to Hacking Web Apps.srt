1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,140
thanks for being patient on the ground
white and when I talk to you today about

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,110
hacking web apps in this is more kind of
an intro for people that are interested

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,190
in getting an InfoSec or as your
developer and wanna learn how to secure

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,640
your own code or anything like that it
says dear towards helping you get

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,310
started it also shows what I do with a
10 tester from client can't wait to

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,970
report delivery and again

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,960
constraints gonna have to keep certain
things but this will give you the

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:50,160
groundwork to go Google and figure out
where you need to basically redo the

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,319
client we have a kickoff call and this
is where I was checking out the rules of

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,940
engagement with the scope is when can we
scan is it ok if we look at this

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,100
application 24 by 7 network its
introduction may be the only one testing

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,009
on off hours so we're not messing up
anything this year what's the URL or

13
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,310
whatever the application is so we make
sure that were actually hitting the

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,340
right in the end in case something does
go wrong if we do break it or we

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,420
actually have now service is something
we need to have the points of contact

16
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,720
that we can call and say it's three

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,820
we broke his stuff and then hopefully
that doesn't happen very often

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,720
evidence gathering so we're doing these
assessments

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,100
a report is expected so the more
evidence you gather going through so

20
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,089
much easier going to make your life when
you gotta start writing the report when

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,720
I first started you know and tester
doing this stuff they were to assess

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,539
into the beginning where they had
ordered shut off access and I didn't get

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,850
good at screenshots or I didn't capture
the correct get imposed on us and our

24
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,910
ability but I had to go to them and ask
them for temporary access that I could

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,100
write documentation of course that's
kind of a bigger say in their best to

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:32,910
make sure that you're recording as much
evidence that can gathering so keep

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,970
everything that I find it there's so
many tools out there that you can use

28
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,590
that are three things that I like to use
personally keep know it comes

29
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,890
pre-installed Kali Kali how everyone sit
it also has an installer for the Mac OS

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:55,268
X or Windows compatible with everything
about it if the client wants to see all

31
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,900
of your raw notes outside of the report
you can easily export everything is a

32
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,220
HTML file and they can see anything as
long as i have a web browser

33
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:15,590
my information so there's a couple of
ways the more you do this figure out

34
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,910
what works best for you and what I found
works best for me if I have several

35
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,200
applications that I'm working on a
single by my group the vulnerability by

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,489
the host or IP that way I can break it
out her application to hand for single

37
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,830
application oldest documented by
vulnerability and as you can see a

38
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:43,450
different color coding and the green
references such as the Cisco credentials

39
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,679
that they have provided me so I know
that I can just sort of ignored those

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,670
when I'm reporting that dark red nose
with your critical direct would be your

41
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,309
serious or high and so on

42
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,120
to me that's just a personal preference
in ashes to quit this or references to

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,190
territory I found it and how it's going
so far

44
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:16,410
you document what is considered evidence
earlier about the get requests in the

45
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,470
response you're sending to the
application that make sure that you are

46
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:30,010
documenting what you're sending as well
as a response to see just a course for a

47
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,490
job

48
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:37,350
cross-site scripting don't just show
that the pop up with the wider dialogue

49
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,810
make sure that you're actually showing
that this is what I sent this is the

50
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,700
parameters that was vulnerable injuries
to respond

51
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,090
wrote that I've actually seen some
consultants get into some deep water

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,729
over don't have her shares closed half
but he did for a client

53
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,910
not a good idea you're probably under
some sort of non-disclosure agreement

54
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,920
anyway so distracted that what's your
friends that you know maybe you were

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:16,410
yesterday you can trust or sanitized
make sure that you get relevant legible

56
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,010
screenshots and more ability to reports
comes through our QA process where you

57
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,110
didn't really tell exactly what it was
that they were trying to call out in a

58
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,450
screenshot so make sure that you are
coming in and actually showing hey this

59
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:39,099
is where the problem is not obvious
example sequel down corn assessment that

60
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,330
I did I wanted to really show the
information but obviously if I were to

61
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,200
take this image in a report and had to
shrink it down you would really be able

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,770
to read it so when you have to figure
out how to take areas that are really

63
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,049
just going to show the importance of the
vulnerability you sound zoom in and make

64
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:08,070
sure that it again you heard me talk
about HTTP request and response example

65
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,130
to sort of how I dotting the code in a
report and you can see the hard part was

66
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:23,600
when I actually sent to find more
ability so what is easily the report

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,660
they can easily see what the problem is
and try and replicate it themselves

68
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:37,550
your testing all parameters and
application don't decide about someone

69
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,160
perimeter and then move on to something
else you're looking at every parameter

70
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,030
and if you do

71
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,109
injection make sure that you are testing
that matters and then document every

72
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,580
single parameter in your report that's
far more that way their client isn't

73
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,729
saying how about how bout them the
password parameter for each other is

74
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,130
horrible to you can't answer that it
looks like you didn't do it for a job so

75
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:15,870
methodologies are great thing to have to
go by citizens about the methodology

76
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,060
these are displayed good enlist help
keep you on track so you know especially

77
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,440
as pen tester reduced several
assessments basically one right after

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,880
another and so this is a good way to
make sure to make sure that I'm looking

79
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:39,680
at each section is sort of a guideline

80
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,980
just something I want to mention to its
don't sell to the methodology that

81
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,990
there's something that's not listed in
there that you know should be added

82
00:07:46,990 --> 00:08:22,980
you know jack that two methodologies are
good guideline and helps you to reach

83
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,470
the party there's a previous hack then
you can find you know credentials are

84
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:38,970
you can notify them by doing this data
base side found higher benefits humans

85
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:45,360
have also found test accounts that were
posted on a development helped that were

86
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,089
still active so you're gonna go

87
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,370
development to get help make sure you
sent it I just don't give the real data

88
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,230
base name of the rule table names and
then you get someone on your test

89
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,790
account make sure when they're done is
we've actually been able to leverage

90
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,120
that quite a few times were open source
intelligence there so many tools

91
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,160
Google's great tool then you have things
like this cover by leaving here this has

92
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,559
many many options that are built into it
to help help you get through this

93
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:34,389
assessment pretty quick after all there
are several reasons why again as I

94
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:42,319
mentioned I usually do you expect an
automated scanners are covering a wide

95
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:53,860
range of things very quickly and they're
good at finding as what you however

96
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:03,190
can versions that can so does that mean
it means that it's just quickly scanning

97
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,140
it doesn't do really much about dinner
accident things that humans and do you

98
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:19,079
don't rely on it and to those that say a
bone scan is again with automated

99
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:25,359
scanners you have to verify the results
don't don't trust was perfect right

100
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,200
they're good at certain things quickly
but don't trust him so for example if

101
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,950
their response and scripting
vulnerability or something

102
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,320
make sure you go check that see what
it's a replay the request and see if

103
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,310
it's legitimate how much further can you
take that more ability if it's not then

104
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:54,329
marketable move on again there's so many
of them out there remember it was saying

105
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,649
they're the ones that he's a regular
basis

106
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:03,730
Nexus is a Grade IV MS stands on a
regular basis to really get it deep dads

107
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,779
on applications

108
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:15,480
gonna grow by three times in the next
two witnesses actually built in the Cali

109
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,990
already you can also install it on
whatever other destroy you have again

110
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,260
it's equipped with automated scanners
it's good for people add me

111
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:36,150
10 voters were back of 54 looking for
basic CDI water deliveries and so on so

112
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:46,920
it's a good time saver DreamWorks
DreamWorks whenever it's built on

113
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,240
Wordpress cold fusion for Joomla Drupal
or anything like that makes me very

114
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,750
happy because I know it's gonna be a fun
assessment things like WGC can those are

115
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,570
available in there dude specifically for
you know frameworks like WordPress for

116
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,980
example bogus numerate

117
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,900
version that's installed it all and
numerate they have so you can search and

118
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,949
see if there are no next words for those
plugins and you can also a numerate user

119
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:24,840
names which you know brute-force
brute-force the login

120
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:35,770
but basically any meaningful words
commonly named for workers there are

121
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,790
huge risk for foreign names where you
can actually do it true brute force for

122
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,360
not only soldiers profiles as well and
by using this school several times I

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,830
have found backup bad sequel database
files that I could just pull down

124
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,790
because they weren't you know any sort
of authentication security by obscurity

125
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,610
was a good idea and and that's not a
good idea so this helps finest things

126
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:14,340
again have many more options in Cali I'm
not quite sure what the menu layout is

127
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:21,600
the new version but and the last word in
Cali this this is then you listen menu

128
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,600
layout is where you were trying for
ability scanners experts

129
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:37,449
automated scanning don't just open the
standard and put in the URL and click Go

130
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:42,339
taking a chance if you do that you need
to look at the application and see OJ is

131
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,709
that this is how it's handled good about
traffic data tests in a little bit and

132
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,670
see me know if you have it open as it is
it gonna kill those gonna knock

133
00:13:51,670 --> 00:14:01,029
something over you don't have dental
service checks available on certain

134
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:07,310
those certain clients request that you
don't really care and again as I mention

135
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:18,050
the number of threads at a time

136
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,599
transmitters are functions that you want
to avoid with the automated standing in

137
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,380
time you'll find that there's a contact
page or maybe a sign-up form that it's

138
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,480
ok if you test manually but if an
automated scanner it's gone flooded and

139
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,620
put you know thousands of requests and
their data base and then some guys got

140
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,839
to clean that up and he's not too happy
about that

141
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,750
again if it's if it's a test environment
it stopped production but if you are

142
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,509
testing in a production environment just
make sure you ask those things and then

143
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:59,889
go on but those exceptions in the stands

144
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:10,160
and everything and you're ready to go
then then hit start testing I wish I had

145
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,160
a little bit more time to dig deeper
into manual testing but again we're kind

146
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,868
of going back to the scan results so as
I mentioned before anything that

147
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:23,259
automated standard gives you make sure
that you're going through and manually

148
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:28,309
verify their signing those so if it says
that there's you know again

149
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:32,238
cross-site scripting vulnerability or
something instead of just documenting a

150
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:39,689
wide problems or something like that can
you actually bring in a malicious

151
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:45,549
javascript and then start blogging how
far can you take that so make sure that

152
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:55,269
with manual testing you're really trying
to leverage these things as much as the

153
00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:01,619
application again rely on the automated
standard to do it put it through a proxy

154
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:09,959
like 30 or a proxy for several others
out there to make sure that that you're

155
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,899
trying to get a very accurate view of
the application

156
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,019
a spider at you when it goes through and
there's a content discovery option on

157
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:25,259
dirrty bro that it will take no names of
URLs and things that it's already bound

158
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:32,610
and see it sort of information that
might be linked pages thats cool down

159
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,580
already

160
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,470
disaster response sometime

161
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,230
most of the time to reply will actually
show you what version it's running

162
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:51,630
whether it's the version number and
sometimes very riverboats and that can

163
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,490
help you save your exploits in your
attacker with more parameters I

164
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,580
mentioned earlier mixture your testing
all parameters and application if there

165
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,700
are several is make a list and down make
a list to make sure that you're hitting

166
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:20,720
each one that way you can you know if
the client to check for scripting

167
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,620
cross-site request forgery sequin held
up in Jackson Hole and remote file

168
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:33,810
inclusions those are all things that are
great British accents and still find

169
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:43,190
quite a few of these results
unfortunately

170
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,770
okay so it's sensitive information being
passed to get requests instead of those

171
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,580
there are quite a few applications i've
seen where they actually cached page to

172
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,480
the browser with the URL username and
the password for the user ID or

173
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,100
something that can be leveraged its so
while optimizing that machine and and

174
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,790
doing some simple forensics that I've
been able to grab gather credentials for

175
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,270
an application so you want to make sure
that any sensitive information is

176
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:24,970
actually being center post requests
looks or look at the source code that's

177
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,840
incredible how many three DS if you want
I've actually sound source code

178
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:39,419
developers into each other saying hey
this causes the fog let's fix this and

179
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,760
whatever Jan test with this account and
so they told me what the bug was and

180
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,080
they gave me credentials to log in and
test and all of this was found as an

181
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,990
unauthenticated user so you know you
wanna come over its its all time

182
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:03,300
consuming but come over each page
response sometimes appliance and get

183
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,999
information

184
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:09,179
death by PowerPoint for a second

185
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,710
have to do it

186
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:27,240
going back to the source code so there's
so many times again that obscurity or

187
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,020
security by obscurity where they'll
utilize JavaScript

188
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,770
admin wings so if you're using him as an
admin it won't show you on the screen

189
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,740
the and leads but if you look in the
code that is right there so can you go

190
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,429
to those and still see them even though
you're not a little user to see those

191
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:55,190
things as a not been indicated user so
you want to make sure to tested from as

192
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,919
a dedicated and indicated user and see
the links and things that you find what

193
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:09,420
did you get to that you're not supposed
to see

194
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,590
looking just just focusing on the
application itself

195
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,220
host that it's on there have been times
where the host has been outdated

196
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,550
unpatched and we've been able to
leverage some of those extra weights

197
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,440
again at no damn roots you the box so
check that is well-known excesses

198
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,130
scanner for that we're just looking at
yourself look at the response to see

199
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,910
what the servers running and then again
you searched and searched or something

200
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,050
just fine

201
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:50,080
exploits to turn to track weapons that
have been portals get talked about the

202
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,860
adamantly

203
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,090
available something that you can brute
force be like tom cat or something

204
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:04,039
cPanel so many things you can look at

205
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:13,789
directory traversal are they using
dangerous HTTP methods there have been a

206
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:20,499
handful of times where they've had been
able so I was able to use a lot of

207
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:26,629
scripted PHD's order asap and the
antivirus and catch it and there I had

208
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:32,529
you know basically ShelterBox just from
crafting a request and then when I was

209
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,159
done

210
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:41,869
method to get off something like that
and you're not able to remove it

211
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:47,789
yourself make sure you keep a note to
let the client know there can take it

212
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:53,090
off so you get clean up its better for
you to tell them instead of a year later

213
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,119
when some guys going through a what's
this you know what's the shell script

214
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:03,639
that's on there you know look and see
what what a gorgeous what services are

215
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:08,770
open with using something like in map

216
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:19,389
pls see what cipher suites have enabled
us 012 RTOS 1.0 who are you know some

217
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,220
weak ciphers leads so these are things
that you can check them know what they

218
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:32,390
need to get rid of what they need to
enable or disable and then again as I

219
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,710
mentioned methodologies

220
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:44,200
just getting into the US so that's a
good way to help keep you on track and

221
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,040
make your own notes something that I do
I am not very smart so don't really

222
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,210
remember demand really well

223
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:57,810
savage I ganic cheat sheet I guess you
call it but I made using cheap no broken

224
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,740
things down by vulnerability of war by
tool a reference that hasn't tried those

225
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:09,200
things over and over again on defense so
keep practicing figure out what the best

226
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,460
way is to your notes and then when
you're ready graphics and web sites are

227
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,490
we doing on time

228
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,920
good cool so make sure to leave some
time open for you and I if anybody has

229
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:38,809
any questions or anything or we can talk
afterwards I know there's a Chinese

230
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:44,940
cleaver a high level to make sure to fit
everything in you say about our talk so

231
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:58,230
thanks for sticking with me

232
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:13,220
told him the author but it's got like
the picture on the front of it there are

233
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:24,730
so many resources on YouTube and Google
Web App Store suite 403 videos and

234
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:36,320
walkthroughs to help you can see me if
you have any questions
