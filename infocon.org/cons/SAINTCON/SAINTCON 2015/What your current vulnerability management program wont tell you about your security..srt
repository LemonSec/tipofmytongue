1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:11,009
it's a no goodnight not done my job as a
prisoner but things are internal network

2
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:18,240
and the targets do not work we're not
going to be talking about external just

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,278
gonna say that up front so a little bit
about me or my name mcconnell

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:33,250
adults and one of their red team members
networking mobile security so I'm

5
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,480
generally not the guy that's going to be
honest I'm going to set aside neither

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,640
britain remotely working on boxes on
your network reporter mobile

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:52,340
applications by me my mom three node is
laying out the Dec one channel GMAC also

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,620
much better if you have questions want
to know anything after this my email in

9
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,519
McConnell

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,290
works for me gmail.com so I wanna do
hoon here is responsible for your

11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:17,080
organization's security and I T three
organization that much everybody so

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:24,250
russia now everyone you are responsible
for your organization's it doesn't

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,000
matter if you're not if you're an
employee for an organization

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,880
you are responsible for security so what
this isn't anything new advanced we're

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,050
not going to talk about the tax we're
not gonna talk about many things we're

16
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,979
not covering anything super in the
reason why I don't need it because I'm

17
00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:02,170
attaching and that works as a red team
member whether it be physically break in

18
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:10,830
and whether I get in touch whatever i
dont not need to exploit I don't need to

19
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,320
use super advanced on your network

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,609
compromise your data what I used is very
basic simple attacks but rules that are

21
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:32,330
already on your network to access their
street years in my mind of what security

22
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:39,890
information system security you have
your human aspect and this isn't just

23
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,559
presentation

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,750
information security reason being that
I'm gonna try to explain this in such a

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,590
way that makes sense that you're human
aspect you cannot assume you can't

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,160
change and the psychology about train on
a human being is so real documented so

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,130
wrong now it doesn't matter I rolled
their retailer we someone in your

28
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,190
organization

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,230
no questions asked and you can assume
that if I get one person to click on a

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:25,299
link in your organization compromising
on your network there's just no

31
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,590
questions about it

32
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:35,090
the second thing about it is this a
security problem you're gonna face

33
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:42,030
there's two real dilemmas one there's no
way to keep me out of your building

34
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,730
unless you work in a missile silo that's
buried under you know hundreds of armed

35
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,429
guards and there's only one point
otherwise I really wanna I've got enough

36
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,940
seats for a term I am coming to a wall

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:08,030
yeah the door I'm given your building
brick through the window you know those

38
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,770
are very destructive violent attacks but
now let's go to him or her side of human

39
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:26,750
and physics to carry such as tell you
you know that's how many times have you

40
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,820
to someone carrying a box aesthetics UPS
guy and you're building a couple boxes

41
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,969
what do you do

42
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:43,339
here let me help you as much as I love
all do that all day every day walk on

43
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:48,979
your network settings boxes down
somewhere good luck my devices networks

44
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:55,889
and walk away you won't see it you know
what's there and now I've got a

45
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:03,689
compromise that is why for those two
things it's imperative that we talked

46
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,209
some information security those two
things are beaten every day

47
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:13,749
information security of your so there's
no emotion there's how ramifications

48
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:21,749
there's no instinctive response by
particular it does exactly what it says

49
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:28,339
goodbye and its guests now in May
behaved inappropriately because the two

50
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,809
attackers altitude but it is doing
exactly what I was told

51
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:49,689
examples of this job fairly early
lockdown lobby they couldn't get past

52
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:55,509
the guards so they can buy the physical
and human aspect to pave

53
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:02,190
started taking a piss everyone

54
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,660
been dropping to god statues everybody
comes all the other patrons took a

55
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
worker walks up behind them

56
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,039
the elevators when it was game over at
that point they walked out with access

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:29,100
about 36 hours everything they want that
one

58
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:41,330
focus on that she doesn't matter if you
don't build that you're protecting your

59
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:52,280
assets it does so there's this is not so
organizations

60
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:00,270
down approach how many of you and hear
how to deal with compliance ok how many

61
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,590
of you in here

62
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,390
directives from management that says you
have to secure your environment you have

63
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,789
to be security to make it so we don't
incidence you know that's not the

64
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:25,940
problem but it doesn't do anything to
security team members PCI HIPAA the year

65
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:35,280
two socks that does not sound
environment in such a way that it is it

66
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:50,969
is very much

67
00:07:50,969 --> 00:08:06,479
100 companies over a billion dollar five
hundred billion dollar company ninety

68
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,998
percent of their security was still
based on scams Nexus how we know that's

69
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:20,079
not buildings we have this is what our
friends this is how we do not follow yes

70
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:27,839
ninety percent of the time and where the
stock started from was that will not

71
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:37,708
catch this thing works it will not just
any day of the week and then here's the

72
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:45,849
other parts of you ensure an unlimited
budget in here have a very small tight

73
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,699
budget you can buy a new product or
maybe you can upgrade that machine you

74
00:08:51,699 --> 00:09:05,378
need for most stuff from here built
environments from the ground up with

75
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:13,029
security in mind how many of you in here
at something happens we need to put them

76
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:20,329
on our VPN where we need to put it in
this day on her email or we have to set

77
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:28,040
stricter passive policy because every
user having the password really you know

78
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,149
it doesn't make sense we have to build a
top we bought today it's not in our

79
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:42,120
environments and that's why I try to get
slapped why don't you dance this is

80
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:51,069
right now it's actually dive into some
of the actual things up I will exploit

81
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,339
on a daily basis

82
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:02,179
tax compromise network how many of you
and hear how such a structure that you

83
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:08,589
will turn up you can secure and the new
go back and disabled every pore except

84
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:18,459
the ones you need reports he don't need
because if you don't have free access

85
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:27,630
how many of you also actually figure
Europe for two specific match if you

86
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:45,519
don't do that I'm going to target device
to a PC devices to be how many of you in

87
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,990
here will actually do to keep your car
wash on DHCP for Microsoft

88
00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:06,720
say a lot of this is very much focused
for ceramics FreeBSD

89
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,730
environments however most corporations
that are most networks I see windows on

90
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:26,550
the network that I can use these acts as
if you you know it doesn't matter

91
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:37,969
also however I need to expand access to
data and continue to evolve or do you

92
00:11:37,970 --> 00:15:02,019
see Config configured to get for these
distracted us in this range

93
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:40,690
will you be

94
00:15:40,690 --> 00:17:13,380
that's a hundred million dollars

95
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:25,839
so I would say about a nine hundred and
ninety billion dollar company they do

96
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,610
they manage tight on money so
hundred-million to them but when a drop

97
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:41,850
in the bucket that a given in yet they
still into thinking about that the next

98
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:51,429
trouble here are some of my absolute
favorite doing here as ever and one

99
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:57,270
person couple people ran tom cat do you
know where the users are configured

100
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:06,590
within the comp project director about
it

101
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:19,949
capacity for all your clear text
interactive logon ko system access but

102
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,580
there's a good likelihood its operations
missions have been screwed up and I'm

103
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:33,040
able to just connect directly to it and
pulled out box up five got it now I've

104
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,800
got the child abusers Tom channel but
not successfully run system

105
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:48,990
be grabbed that user login tom cat
employees do I gotta show I can be

106
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:55,690
hashes I can dump everything in like
this since tom cat is also a fabrication

107
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:05,030
using to close its hot summer months
large tracts a lot of time domain admin

108
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:15,020
are seen as key configs where the root
password to the database they don't get

109
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,830
their asses they use room with the root
password database

110
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,250
lot of times people don't change their
passwords across multiple databases so

111
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:34,799
the root password for one database is
the same for every database great

112
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,450
wonderful the last week he isn't sure
how many of you in here have an internal

113
00:19:41,450 --> 00:20:49,940
Richie SharePoint something that you
used documents

114
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:05,049
shared

115
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:47,670
going through that

116
00:21:47,670 --> 00:22:22,980
500

117
00:22:22,980 --> 00:23:05,930
monitor every time my laptop fire up
here to pick Cebu your network as I

118
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,970
start to image in your image to
employees generally speaking what

119
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,510
happens when you deploy again

120
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:22,990
can get it wrapped ready and then what
do you do it's actually the next thing

121
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:32,150
you want to do for that machine anybody

122
00:23:32,150 --> 00:24:06,400
done prior to joining machine to the
elevated

123
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:33,290
day one

124
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:46,070
reason you're not going to hear what I
want to monitor your pics of your

125
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:52,460
deployment watch

126
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,050
yeah

127
00:24:54,050 --> 00:25:00,550
I didn't think about this either and
tell the sex I actually I don't have tax

128
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:06,820
imaging you build a golden image you
deploy everything we need

129
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,950
k road works your workstations needs to
be able to fix the computer quickly run

130
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,510
too long there they don't want to
transform back and forth so they do they

131
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:23,510
put a minute hidden directory on the
SEDAR after they put on some work very

132
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,990
detailed hey we need to be able to put
around these tools so I used to know I'm

133
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:40,970
not gonna points a finger at the most
users don't go but I will I gain access

134
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,380
to one machine and I started poking
around just a little bit but here's the

135
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,130
same record as all these systems are you
have system configuration scripts I

136
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,920
wanna times descriptive hardcoded
credentials so that they can run up and

137
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:06,430
leave you know some of them will
prompted it just really depends so that

138
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,060
being said though there's an attacker if
I sign that contains a skirt initials

139
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:17,210
are sworn enemies so strapped by
temperature was to do something else for

140
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,250
me

141
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:27,940
that's great that's not that's the least
you're looking at that scene admins on

142
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,220
people's walls and security you need to
be thinking about what you're actually

143
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:39,350
put it in your images are you leaving
behind

144
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:48,560
configuration management SCCM from
Microsoft

145
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,629
question for you do you go back and
invalidate all your packages after

146
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,420
referring to deploy

147
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:03,460
machines

148
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,700
next question have you ever pulled apart
the strategist who struck say you need

149
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,529
to install something or driver for
what's required elevated privileges at

150
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:20,020
least machine and likely it's an account
that gets used but is also linked to the

151
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,908
domain sometimes yes sometimes no but
there's an admin account that allows it

152
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:27,820
to check in a rock and a sec

153
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:36,539
that allows it to do the place of these
machines so what do you think might

154
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:51,629
happen if a crowd was able to compromise
that

155
00:27:51,630 --> 00:28:06,570
so we could sit at the admin prediction
stress gradient we when it rolled up our

156
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,350
own she'll put it out there looks like
we did however reduced cover department

157
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:19,010
I'll get to that but we've got a shelter
every server on the network running his

158
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:29,960
administrative privileges sooner we want
an hour we're on the train ourselves we

159
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,140
could stop are deployed and redeployed
to machine so Monday morning when all

160
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:45,270
the users came back in wrong back in our
culture over 5,000 more shells and we

161
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:51,160
couldn't handle the temporary census was
the amount of shells we had coming back

162
00:28:51,160 --> 00:29:04,840
just an absolute bad day bad times and
code towards doing here transactions

163
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,409
4000 test

164
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:48,770
actually

165
00:29:48,770 --> 00:30:04,970
everyday man and i right

166
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:13,020
administrative privileges on that box
box almost guaranteed administrative

167
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,160
purposes and then I'm in the house
somewhat elevated privileges based upon

168
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,600
who ran into our studio secured the
boxes were it actually turned down but

169
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:35,800
it is a sure way to get a show and to
some 200 limited to do you got a

170
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,830
structured in or go to Google

171
00:30:38,830 --> 00:31:59,240
to search out there just encouraging
consensus out there on the way

172
00:31:59,240 --> 00:33:23,110
and what our intelligence building your
network broadcast I'm looking for Ashes

173
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,959
on your network

174
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:33,400
sure I send the masai I've got a big 25
GPU cracking groups that I have access

175
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,490
to so many of you your masters in here

176
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:52,250
password minimum no

177
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:58,100
ok then what's troubling what's the
likelihood that a password is gonna get

178
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:04,110
cracked just lost users are always this
summer

179
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:19,489
2016 special exclamation capital letters
capitalized the first I've got my

180
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:39,629
special characters and i got to
understand their I don't forget to ya

181
00:34:39,629 --> 00:36:15,390
but it's very predictable

182
00:36:15,390 --> 00:37:42,799
things that are you know

183
00:37:42,799 --> 00:38:30,249
and I'll wait 10 minutes I'll jump to
another box run number to try to stay so

184
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:44,468
I can grab driving season box you name
it at that point it's just a matter of

185
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:49,100
time before I find what I'm looking for

186
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:57,100
I'm actually backed out whether the 3G
modems whether it be booked another

187
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:04,620
possible compromise or if I've got a big
enough so hard on my cock sucked up on

188
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,630
your network about my guy on the ground
go back in full up box back out

189
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:34,520
everything is all too soon after I miss
considerations are looking for systems

190
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:43,900
have been to God going in there but even
so hundreds of organizations I've got

191
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:51,340
what I have ever seen anywhere in 2002
at a remote desktop on their internal

192
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,690
networks because of an old my setup
would secure the perimeter weheartit

193
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:05,310
down and everything kind of Russian side
mister in there is a lot that is at this

194
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:13,000
point where I am and my attack all your
data will call you this whatever I came

195
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,190
to find

196
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,630
now the question is what I was just
talking about here thinks it would

197
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,030
actually depicting gonna hear things
that actually noticed you nominees in

198
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,350
their traffic or in their service
communications the gym was detected

199
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:36,589
after their networks and here's to rock
and looks at the deal honestly feel that

200
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:43,240
they could stop their first dance attack
using basically the TAC towards on their

201
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,430
network

202
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:55,529
so that's so what does any of what I
just told you have to do is your

203
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:08,330
organization has any of what I just told
you about any idea what kind of discuss

204
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:14,250
shared a minute how to fix some of those
other problems kind of what you need to

205
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:21,490
do better as the day if I could just
give you had a six days problems give

206
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:27,770
you the carrot 2006 discussing this
right what happens when it comes out and

207
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:38,030
becomes a very basic anatomy so I need
you here

208
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:45,570
jennifer Love paradigm shift lights
fundamentals you know there's been some

209
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,430
discussion Stevenson discussions going
on at this conference

210
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:55,620
you know what miss any of those matters
if I can give you a great day for

211
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,720
underlying issues in it

212
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,930
it doesn't matter what I do write
anybody does your environments not built

213
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:12,089
in such a way to be able to detect
attacks and respond to it with a new

214
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,500
mobility in the way of things don't
worry your perimeter how many of you and

215
00:42:16,500 --> 00:43:53,609
your views of cloud-based solution but I
don't ever tell me now this should

216
00:43:53,609 --> 00:44:29,759
shouldn't I don't want to hear your job
is to make that showed it looks good I

217
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,650
made mistakes but think about it is a
time on your networks I am going to make

218
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,690
mistakes but the first couple of days
I'm gonna try to access to research

219
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:46,819
I'm gonna try to do something I don't
have some issues to jobs to find it and

220
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:54,380
see those anomalies not your job to be a
hundred percent rock down third-round

221
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:03,940
robots they're not they're not they
don't focus on their motion that is why

222
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:11,550
we need to take and send it to buy it
area and not try to stop users because

223
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:20,410
it's always going to happen so we as an
industry we have to be better at

224
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:25,160
teaching diploma with users yes they
should be better yes they can be better

225
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,450
but no we got to stop blaming them for a
compromise we need to start checking out

226
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:50,618
over some sort of yeltsin have any ideas
what next step should be what

227
00:45:50,619 --> 00:46:02,109
saying you know what we did first thing
she takes a step back

228
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:08,640
go to your management building your
business stakeholders find 12 gold

229
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:23,328
two-year environment is for sure
couldn't tell me every piece of critical

230
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:30,470
data on their network where it's located
the Commission chiron down it is in such

231
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:42,038
a way that walk down and say ok this is
where my girls this is where I have to

232
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:53,499
be the most secure anybody know where
all your completed because I may not get

233
00:46:53,499 --> 00:47:03,359
a compromise was your big billion 220
billion dollar company also you've got

234
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:11,589
twenty thousand employees 30,000
employees can still and that includes

235
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:18,200
our healthcare formation which means I
can turn increase healthcare information

236
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:25,140
if your software shop where is your code
let me ask how many of you in here

237
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:53,040
basic public open source because you
need to know where it's at then the next

238
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,720
thing you need to find out

239
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:02,149
good business stakeholders not just use

who to call the stock and bond markets

242

laptops where are all of our competitive
market analysis its losses that you know

243
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:28,930
how to start struggle but like I don't
understand where all that is critical

244
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:38,598
all of that document you need to go sit
down at an accomplishment

245
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:45,460
shares always stated this is where it
now works protected given the mall to

246
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:53,289
buy off you continue with the status quo
nothing will change your environment

247
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:59,210
will be still wide open records obtained

248
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:06,989
builders don't know how to lock down
their own environment how to reach the

249
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:13,059
spektr state once you know where this is
going to management said look there is

250
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:19,609
every bit of time I know exactly where
to move data we've moved servers we know

251
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,339
it's all right here

252
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:25,479

retain so come here you know your target

258
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:15,930
or Home Depot there's limited choices
but it's here just a small mom-and-pop

259
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:21,210
shop and there's a couple other
competitors out there and your credit

260
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,410
card in all your information sleep and
success summer it's likely they're going

261
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,279
to go elsewhere

262
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:35,570
how's your business to handle that you
need these kind of questions what she

263
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:42,400
have it in you know this is how it is
and you put that fear of God in your

264
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,740
management that is used to screw this up
we go out of business I lose my job

265
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:56,720
everybody else loses their job you know
and if you're a healthcare company are

266
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,859
you personally liable under some of the
HIPAA laws now healthcare executives can

267
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,590
be held liable

268
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:14,670
and serve actual jails a nuclear reactor
standards coming out just what it is no

269
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:20,770
longer onus on the banks that there is
gross negligence failure to do their

270
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:28,290
part correct we can be held liable so
targets insurance the bank's kind of

271
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:34,120
took care of everything kind of all got
our target handle having to pay for

272
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:40,640
credit monitoring lots of every game and
then lots of other merchandise paid for

273
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:50,750
by those fraudulent cards today like
they're big enough but still put a huge

274
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:57,980
dent in their evidence you need to ask
those kind of questions once you have it

275
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:04,020
map out your security means a larger
projects I would have you in here n roll

276
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:14,090
San upgraded or at old servers domains
it needed upgraded why not when you're

277
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:22,480
upgrading take increased your budget a
little bit and insecurity right sit down

278
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,710
and actually map your security needs to
these projects and build it now you will

279
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,620
change your security and saw the ball to
get on top

280
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:36,750
you're doing it at the time but it's
already being rebuilt so it's not done

281
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:42,770
correctly and more securely just makes
everybody shopper reviews Jeremy and and

282
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:55,200
it continued strength and I'm sorry say
again even if your job title doesn't say

283
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:04,299
security and it it is your job as an
employee for every new works for secure

284
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:10,170
whether that be being cognizant issue
making sure that you're setting strong

285
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:16,360
passwords you see something just doesn't
feel right

286
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,360
recorded automatically load up the
manager said well this doesn't feel

287
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,730
right

288
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:33,430
this just continue to be that squeaky
wheel types of issues get resolved that

289
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:40,868
is your job as a user and even more so
this year and I T person

290
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:51,259
be going and complaining demanding but
recipients of documentation to know

291
00:53:51,259 --> 00:54:02,230
everything about you I wanna know what I
want to know what's database

292
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:12,819
configuration once running gives me she
helped so much detail on this you see

293
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:17,400
one minor variance you know you have a
breach because it's out of the normal

294
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:29,839
for you have a user and the Machine you
need about to say we need change this

295
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,849
mindset

296
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:39,779
operating in a responsive motive to
operate in Minamoto we are 24 by 7

297
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:46,720
compromises are always compromise
environment and we need to continuously

298
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:53,160
react in such a way that it varies from
the norm

299
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:59,788
reach until we can prove otherwise not
your luck and exceed monitoring

300
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:13,009
monitoring is she just that's affecting
your ideas your firewall so big so they

301
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:20,430
protect you from some of these assistant
at me ask you an honest question do you

302
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:24,399
know why you Joe at 3 a.m.

303
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:31,830
walking speed development server when
he's an account or do you even know that

304
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:43,830
he is why is your sequel sure you do
your domain controller on 36 airforce

305
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:51,910
all the time now why does that normally
happen and Sarah any of you that don't

306
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:57,350
know how to standard default warrant
that medicine that is slowly payloads

307
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:02,360
and mature proposal it's generally run
from the shoot that's just had a basic

308
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,720
willy nilly

309
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,000
rising why do these things top why are
they doing that any of you and hear that

310
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,120
would be checked the secret service to
ensure on your environment

311
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:23,730
your web server on some say non-standard
port could you tell me why there was

312
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,970
talking on those terms

313
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:33,290
you can't tell me that if you can answer
that kind of a question you don't have

314
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:42,540
enough profile of your government to
know what it is and what's not

315
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:49,529
and I'm gonna tell you that's why I say
monitoring is to this because if you can

316
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:57,900
not see families in your network what's
going on you can respond to a breach

317
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:04,540
until the FBI Secret Service comes
naturally bill Doran says we notice yes

318
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,830
you're serving this or we trace your
credit card week back here in Business

319
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:21,630
Bureau alrighty sids our firewall hasn't
said anything worth 40 devices actually

320
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,550
see it now

321
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:30,670
away from that we just had a new device
plugin for this device is now change MAC

322
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:38,750
Address see those kind of things how can
you expect to harden your source not

323
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:44,020
protection

324
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:53,670
locked in your physical locations be
better about your physical security be

325
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:54,800
better about yours

326
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,440
information security don't read things
just don't read things just running make

327
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,960
sure users are actually machines are
talking about even if you have to be a

328
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,810
stickler

329
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:14,509
five minutes of inactivity I'm going to
scream General about and check under

330
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,880
your keyboard I had to do that in a very
large grammar one of my tasks on a

331
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:36,020
Friday night after he'd be harsh your
job's not to make sense to protect us

332
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:42,980
mean he makes an inside straight but if
that compromises your retirement

333
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,220
security because of it

334
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:53,990
some work since last summer in time rome
wasn't built in a day you're not gonna

335
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,759
hard and everything go back sharon today

336
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,370
garden everything down and be good

337
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:09,920
you gonna take start with the most
critics start to build a primitive there

338
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:32,470
and then continue to build but you have
to know where you start

339
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:37,129
I actually started
