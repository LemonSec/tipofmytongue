1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:11,209
women I'm kinda sorta vision software
engineering institute Carnegie Mellon

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:18,119
University on the situation awareness
team and general analyst trainee

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,930
researcher myself to be a lot of people
think about the problems of the

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:38,399
conversation and bottom out an indicator
where customers can tell lies they tell

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,010
me about the state of the law normally
detection me anomaly detection versus

6
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,440
signature detection thinking about this
and I think this really comes down to

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,929
where a lot of the people who are you
don't necessarily have a good

8
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,550
understanding of what he is just what I
see no trades

9
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,920
let's talk about that a little bit today
but more quietly what I wanna do as I'm

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:17,540
gonna find you as an analyst we are in
discussions that don't believe how fast

11
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,240
your job so I'm gonna present a way that
I have come to you and start to think

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:40,690
about even in ways I can come out and
help me find someone talked about was

13
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:46,450
security use a series of actions I'm
ready to one event is not just have one

14
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:53,650
of a number of security landscape that's
made up of many devices computer

15
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,940
components of your reputation is going
through security landscape

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,890
the impact of these contacts didn't hear
you by events are not just actions are

17
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:14,760
you free that's not an event to event is
part of what makes the security men and

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:24,500
some reactions causes harm in some
manner is very much an organisation

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,980
people

20
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:34,609
not seem man in a few different
depending on the organization for

21
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,459
instance not over realizations standing
as a teacher Thomas just something that

22
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:49,739
happens it's really big deal when I
think about a fence organizations have a

23
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,430
good handle on how to respond to numb
your friends but a little bit harder

24
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,269
when it comes to hunting for you don't
have an alert to earlier today what's on

25
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,190
our presentation of Pope wear either
those types of organizations once I

26
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,629
haven't action ones that don't know they
can we don't know you can check that's

27
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:18,709
really hard training analyst position
because we don't know and no you don't

28
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,970
aren't told what we should be looking
for told that we should be looking for

29
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:32,450
something to think about when we want to
hunt

30
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:40,299
to identify people care about so do we
care about this game is that we're gonna

31
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:50,300
hunt usually more than incident response
team activity and filtration approved

32
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,400
for us and for our organization and we
care about the we need to go hunting for

33
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:07,349
you know that when you start identifying
be that make up the S&P analyst finance

34
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:15,399
event in our dogs are under since
nineteen architecture you know the

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,340
actions

36
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:24,219
a lot of those actions make up with jim
DeMint communications or as well which

37
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,020
would not be an event so friends and
when you have a tax increase in network

38
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,370
traffic and you can see the Network Time
wow does not have legitimate chance to

39
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:43,889
even hear what is it that the actions of
an attack would indicate that something

40
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,500
is legitimate identified that

41
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,270
but the ones that are most likely to
meet likely to be legitimate it's not

42
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,280
looking for those actions first assuming
you actually have a century architecture

43
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,359
history behind the action really want to
get a hearing for an analyst we need to

44
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,530
define investigate the actions so we
don't say that an associate professor

45
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:21,619
attack somebody just got a large number
name use your idea to tend to track each

46
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:32,340
server to do know its stars Nina
communication start opens communities

47
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,080
ever since potentials get messages
repeat some number of times that would

48
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,479
be a set of actions that would define
the S et tu brute force attack in

49
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,940
addition don't define you can't blame
user policy is taken mister next year's

50
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,440
slides his examples the National Center
for Education Statistics and they're

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,610
simple Acceptable Use Agreement policy
organizations will do fine

52
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,990
events

53
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:14,130
based on intense not intentionally seek
information on WoW intent and delicious

54
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:21,180
of an attention getter in concrete and
used for commercial purposes is

55
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,640
prohibited content can you intend
estimate based on most definitely happy

56
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,979
to have this subtitle types of events
that are definitions that are arbitrary

57
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,900
disabuse

58
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,679
generative what is an inappropriate text
as determined by the system

59
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:52,690
administrator that is very subjective
matters I'm sure we have the analysts

60
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,920
need or something closer to the still
doesn't get down to rubble where we

61
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,110
analyzed and optimized Association of
software games attributed establishing

62
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,120
that were internet connections are
things that we as investors start to

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,310
work with because we have a good
understanding of what this actually mean

64
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:19,650
so it's especially workshop do as I'm
going to talk about and that means an

65
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,140
indicator that talked about how I like
to think of designing new men's swim

66
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,469
more accurately the actions that make up
my mind there's something that I am

67
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:37,370
as of right now calling the definition
matrix and then I'm going to social

68
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,380
discussion where I had there on the back
seats on each side of the room and he

69
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,850
want to get one can you don't you don't
need one to society's recession of

70
00:07:49,850 --> 00:08:04,030
actually applying the initial consult a
tax refunds based on generic landscape

71
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:25,590
landscape in any organisation has a
landscape landscape is made up of

72
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:33,610
different this is very generic but it
gives you a pretty good idea when that

73
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,320
weren't any number of organizations
companies with assets we have devices

74
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,920
that users interact with users will have
to provide services

75
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,180
users may or may not interact with this
drug and devices that can sign

76
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,719
writers

77
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,380
users themselves which are also in
addition reputation isn't something I

78
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,050
normally people but it really is and if
you don't really think about this group

79
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:19,089
grade you were in addition to our nation
and in some cases like me and you and

80
00:09:19,089 --> 00:15:27,490
it's so maybe you can you email Twitter

81
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,230
wanted to send given no description of
the next one of the actions and makeup

82
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:40,010
and beauty and 20 P Town service attack
I just ate something like a response

83
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:57,899
volume and coming back to one ratio that
you can do the same thing with the same

84
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:58,970
thing when

85
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:07,420
and i no description and could be
enacted when I G address can contact the

86
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:16,310
DNS server but it doesn't use in know
the answer just don't really know

87
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:25,520
but it does set of characteristics and
isn't expected behavior and i no

88
00:16:25,520 --> 00:17:19,260
deviation you might have something like
the device supports me think of you and

89
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,890
applications do not indicate yes and and
the location there may not be an actual

90
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:39,450
party triggered by Martin characters 16
may actually provide replications of

91
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,060
action

92
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,929
prices for packet capture picture
backgrounds for your network and see

93
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:53,410
what it does when we did when we make
our definitions based on the actions we

94
00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:01,040
have to make our definitions used in a
region defined we can't use the detailed

95
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:13,889
real-time an end up if he only the most
basic skills and location in Windows she

96
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:26,820
indicated by the author

97
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:50,980
go back it's pretty basic kitchen when
we gonna look for security events will

98
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,529
not be able to do we need to think of
what we want to find once you've done

99
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:00,399
that we can identify the actions of what
are identified and actions that are

100
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:04,850
least likely to be legitimate and then
build some sort of definition pretty

101
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:14,918
sure those actions its definitions 10 be
one of these six types so I'm going to

102
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:22,080
give an example and then I would like it
if not I'm not really sure that I have

103
00:19:22,080 --> 00:20:57,460
anything hours

104
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:11,460
season started this time since you can
say yes

105
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,590
simple never did you can sample the data
you may only get us your sensor me only

106
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:27,220
pick up information maybe 100 closed as
not very useful if you're interested you

107
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,100
need to cheat in fact occur while you
only got one one-hundredth of your data

108
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,120
how do you know that your event not
occur in the other 99% of your data is

109
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,928
another way to see a friend and that is
that instead of complete in which he is

110
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:49,149
somebody is going to be off because it
only seen it so you may have you may

111
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:53,418
have a communications and media I sent
you tend to get that if I might simply

112
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:54,890
run out of a hundred

113
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,539
11 out of 10 jacket I'm not gonna see
that I sent you want I'm not gonna know

114
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:38,070
that I am what I received a record of
everything ok

115
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:48,929
unidirectional in other words I sent you
that's one load you send your responses

116
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,720
back to me that's another slow their
space you can put the clothes together

117
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,650
and see which side had more
communications and it gives me more than

118
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:13,740
I sent you I don't know that in a home
where does so just stick with their

119
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,990
unidirectional sessions but either way
actually works he just doesn't know the

120
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,560
difference

121
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,310
definitions you don't you don't finish
it appropriately there are other

122
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:33,250
variations file does not have the same
kills it depends on the quality is never

123
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,720
closed the store the network low
probably need to use to analyze it

124
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
almost

125
00:23:41,520 --> 00:24:03,270
included the source and destination IP
addresses and ports of call later we

126
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:14,090
start time and duration but you can
calculate ICMP type the code

127
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:31,320
and a 94 this discussion will include
don't break out between initial

128
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:45,070
inspection center scene which network
programs will call I like it when they

129
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,620
break it up

130
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,879
financial system helps you understand
specialty turkey he started the

131
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:57,539
community he said and not an act you
know that person that side started a

132
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,400
communication device itself

133
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:10,070
sensor location that's very important
because that challenge you will only see

134
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,460
it on your border and see a different
set of actions and if you see internally

135
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:30,230
specially if you have between 7-8 in our
discussion that all riders landscape as

136
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,650
you actually have a picture and he was
picking up their back there and not sure

137
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:40,830
if there's a hard cock there's an
electronic copy at this point are not

138
00:25:40,830 --> 00:26:00,760
forcing areas I am really do you guys
think about each of these scenarios but

139
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,080
with the atoms be and how would you
define this action tomorrow with his

140
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:11,510
speech group course alert

141
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:20,850
obviously there's something always a
picture in time which is sometimes it

142
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:27,399
came across a blog post or your boss 21
cents I heard about this thing what

143
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,250
happened

144
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:40,770
proposal learn what would be the actions
you want to get together on the other

145
00:26:40,770 --> 00:27:28,910
hand maybe I'm just starting out you

146
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,790
so you could see the flood was a two
different locations

147
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,030
flow at the first order reaction would
be wow we know that there's going to be

148
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:47,870
a sense since then you're going to have
another slow the first time it is going

149
00:27:47,870 --> 00:28:04,879
to be a call when you know that
eventually is going to be repeated to

150
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:13,250
get me some one direction one side and
behinds 1771 gonna have hired by

151
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:21,870
would be less likely to indicate
legitimate circumstances one of the

152
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:29,530
biggest problem this one where we have a
set of actions define them accurately by

153
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:36,470
a lot of things like this so which will
be held me tight read in germany circa

154
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:47,120
2001 things about you missed the stage
for stuart is the actions so we have

155
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,620
going on line looks like going back a
number of packages gonna have a number

156
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,840
but it will probably gonna have that
repeated a lot of times because you're

157
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
gonna have a failed attempts

158
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,670
eventually see how to start again most
servers home

159
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:11,340
32 started trying even if they don't
actually gonna have it may be trying

160
00:29:11,340 --> 00:30:48,990
times

161
00:30:48,990 --> 00:31:06,020
go back here and we think that is an
action involves an accent walls and

162
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,510
actor when I say I don't necessarily
mean a person means something like it's

163
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,350
a itself is a machine

164
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,800
usually on behalf of a person

165
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,570
location so format irons actually coming
to the US for having been worried about

166
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:32,580
what would have to happen first of all
we have to be more specific about how

167
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:38,610
we're very minimal wear what we wanted
to be i dont selling a tight but how we

168
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:46,479
wanted to spreading center how do we how
does the box say that we get it

169
00:31:46,480 --> 00:32:05,049
so then you get inspected by a spam bot
what are some reactions will be the

170
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:31,940
first action that would have to cover
for you to eventually have gone by

171
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,100
you can't really see anywhere is better

172
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:48,209
created the case people scream and did
well that's me and so he reads it sends

173
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,549
it somewhere which is asked to go
through her around our house to relay it

174
00:32:52,549 --> 00:33:00,940
so that connection then it goes to the
firewall the last few action is another

175
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,389
hour and then get it has to be rerouted
action gonna get somewhere where it gets

176
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:13,908
so that our kitchen has a project that
action and from there you know you don't

177
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:23,279
want to have a set of actions actions
disregard that only happened at work

178
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:40,820
flow would be most likely to indicate
that this is not legitimate if we have

179
00:33:40,820 --> 00:34:10,819
any action that would be most likely to
indicate that this is not legitimate

180
00:34:10,820 --> 00:35:05,190
if we don't have the wrong on our
website what would be the next like

181
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,600
reaction that would be nice to know that
this is an event

182
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,430
is there anything I would have used to
infer maybe there was some bad news came

183
00:35:15,430 --> 00:38:32,480
out maybe

184
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:56,010
what would be the first to be 1014
insider threat actual external so what

185
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:09,630
would be the actions that we would
expect to see so now in town fam hey I

186
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,880
have a dentist or maybe my database
server and the corner so for this

187
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,010
particular and exercise I'm going to
look for data that is moving from the

188
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,810
database server when it should be a good
thing about let's hope it's moving from

189
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,090
the database everyone I should be what
does that mean what would be some

190
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:37,900
possible actions wow it could be
somebody who is not user ID is not

191
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,820
authorized

192
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:48,690
the database server where to download
the database server because of trying

193
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:59,310
something like the root server is
restrained at out why is the root user

194
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:05,049
restrained and that was six months and
most scenarios I cannot imagine movies

195
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,990
434

196
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,600
there will be some other ways that we
could define that we have to find the

197
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:31,670
action of being removed from the
database server

198
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:49,760
somebody who normally post down as would
all be ways that he had actually time

199
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,290
for this particular change your
perception thereof as I can help

200
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:10,500
investigate almost hostilities is based
on somebody's doing a lot of data that

201
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:23,040
makes it easier to find indication end
networks so we taking action and one of

202
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,040
the indication that it feels that
there's a lot of data that is an odd

203
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,020
reason

204
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,320
trend on our network flow between
different addresses and start thinking

205
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:42,630
about ok and try when does it change the
change that would be probably one of the

206
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,910
ways of start looking so scarce again
because no one really isn't very

207
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,279
descriptive there's very limited

208
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,090
characteristics that we can work out
their dream job actual actions that any

209
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:03,340
of those characteristics and still going
to be a little hard to really like

210
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:09,150
certainty and that were close but it's
gonna get her closer to him into what it

211
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:43,269
is and even an error search

212
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:56,749
is what I have high-level data like that
one can use to search for an out and

213
00:42:56,749 --> 00:43:02,058
narrowing down my search so I know right
at the network level of the Jacksonville

214
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:07,729
like that of other things will too but
then I've just got down 90% the traffic

215
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:12,189
but I need to look at the ideas and I
need to investigate further then you can

216
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:16,489
go down and run down into more detail
ball and you've already been able to

217
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:23,170
around a lot

218
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:43,890
so there's no way to be certain people
tell them to look what are some things

219
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,328
here and do what are some of the actors
even expect to see it differently from

220
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:59,660
that might indicate

221
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:33,160
because

222
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:44,118
it's really important to understand
what's going on here in our normal

223
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,059
routine and not only that actually
understand the actual layout of your

224
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:53,030
network so it really helps me know that
you have the section over here that has

225
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,980
his forces and their you tonight is down
here these are my servers I don't like

226
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,609
what I see so you don't even have that
level of detail because they have made

227
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:09,140
some really nice network diagram time
they don't have to the network diagram

228
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:23,038
of the update and then have to come up
with ways to get around so they may also

229
00:45:23,039 --> 00:46:14,940
be

230
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:25,650
be a number and signature I often see
people don't understand how they overlap

231
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,599
or don't know and I'm sorry you really
think about it is just anything

232
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,410
unexpected places I think it turns some
sort of characteristics that define and

233
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:42,040
there is some overlap and organizations
don't realize that those saying give me

234
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:49,180
something that is not only to talk to
detection products because I already

235
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,259
have entered into action I noticed that
a lot of things that are labeled as an

236
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,869
object detection really do their anomaly
detection based on teenagers get into

237
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:10,280
the bed to the round where they're
starting to actually deal with TV so I

238
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,690
really high chance to turn away from
that terminology and thinking about it

239
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:57,550
turns out that something that I find
events based on description

240
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:11,020
at least when I get the requirements I
don't work internally in nineteen

241
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:17,450
customers give us a presenting this
comes twice then not interested they

242
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,350
don't talk about it that way they also
talked about senators and anomaly is

243
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:31,339
sometimes really when they mean when
they say and only today means something

244
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:36,200
that's new do they mean some deviation
not always here and sometimes even when

245
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,279
the team document will be talking using
a team wants me two different things

246
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:52,720
because they don't understand the
concept and I exactly yes I think we

247
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,149
should have a way to get them to move
away from that a little bit and make our

248
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:04,920
job a little easier to maintain started
pressing them more ok so first of all

249
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,650
how to find me

250
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:13,030
what is it that you don't tell me that
you care about you more details you care

251
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,670
about internal and external access to
care about any large amount of data

252
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:25,910
being with your network more only offer
specific highest ranking US and China

253
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:34,950
India and impact the adverse event is
adversely impacted cracks in their mind

254
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,730
really helps assisting in the west to
the actions that we might actually find

255
00:49:40,730 --> 00:50:40,770
an unsecured

256
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:57,130
going to come down so and I am very
concept makes sense and it's ok

257
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,730
everything out there are you should
check out what protocol eventually gonna

258
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:09,360
get down to business where data where to
start and close all have the same sort

259
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,560
of character is very hard but she did
you get the same thing if you can

260
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:20,200
actually get your data really I think
about you only to see that all this is

261
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,350
when things are wrapping all the same
thing happened to me maybe there's other

262
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,279
things happening but there's a

263
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,560
characteristic that you're talking about
network slow they have the same range by

264
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:42,170
your range time range that's fine you
can start signing starts against st. are

265
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:54,530
these related or the same attack is a
bigger eventually it might be good to be

266
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:29,210
able to start the machine learning yes

267
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:48,140
good when she can induce an expense on
most networks you probably know that

268
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:53,589
it's subtitle ok fine just pointed it at
that point it's not good at least you

269
00:52:53,590 --> 00:53:01,700
can start a family and driving drinking
problems is when obviously come in to

270
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,910
authorities and now you need to
determine what's normal

271
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,240
well that's not all maybe the fact that
you are already compromised and we have

272
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:19,540
no way to check it out I don't know the
answer to that question i my hypothesis

273
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,130
and I started playing around with this
kind of area town gotta try not to

274
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:33,810
actually see any results are be able to
sit here is that each of you to think

275
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:39,110
she needs a comparative basis to
themselves over time and you need to

276
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:45,260
compare devices consumer devices when
you gonna be able to start seen

277
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:52,050
differences go to my own historical
behaviour change and reply if I'm

278
00:53:52,050 --> 00:54:00,050
supposed to be doing the same thing as
you going to have two different views in

279
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:36,720
20

280
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:48,589
so don't understand or don't have the
ability to ensure their network in the

281
00:54:48,590 --> 00:55:01,340
way that answers the questions they
wanted to get in though I think the

282
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:10,170
basic problem that is that a lot of our
customers and whether there whether the

283
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,620
government as we are enough apart easy
do occasionally have commercial

284
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:21,279
customers is that they weren't so where
did they needed to answer the questions

285
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,410
that there now now when asked should
have no way of getting so when you have

286
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:46,740
events and actually turned out to be

287
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:56,990
they don't understand that each action
has workstation quality need to see

288
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:02,209
actions you need something that tells
you that we leave that to you as well as

289
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:08,140
they look at logs and then look at login
or from a performance perspective ok

290
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,700
where I belong to monitor my performance
when am I not at the wall to not

291
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:18,480
entirely wrong in his exclusive watching
gives you too much information deposits

292
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,990
so there's a lot of reasons for
organizations not to love and they don't

293
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,069
understand the reasons why they should
be and where they should lock from a

294
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:37,600
security perspective

295
00:56:37,600 --> 00:57:05,259
it does imply that this number implies
that there are even no matter how well

296
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,200
we are skilled are certain things that
you're never gonna be able to tell and

297
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,399
it's really frustrating and analyze when
we have my station management come to us

298
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,360
and say but what about the false
positive rate you just give me something

299
00:57:19,360 --> 01:00:46,210
where everything works

300
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:52,540
as an analyst but sometimes you run
across concept while but I don't have

301
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:58,460
the ability to spell potato you need wow
you manage that are there some ways it

302
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:06,330
can go outside and what is based on how
we use it and then there are so many

303
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:25,200
ways to treat you like a gesture there
are some simple data

304
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:43,980
so yes we're short and I think that's an
open source projects but when we

305
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:54,780
actually have access to services and she
said there are some others I'm not sure

306
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:05,470
that there are three in a row in street
so we have a balance problems very

307
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:05,868
helpful
