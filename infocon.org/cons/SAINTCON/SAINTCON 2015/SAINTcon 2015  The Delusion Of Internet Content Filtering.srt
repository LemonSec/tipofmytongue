1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:03:16,319
today we're going to talk a little bit
about there's a lot of expectations

2
00:03:16,319 --> 00:04:26,820
to declare publicly from the western
alabama and also uses its research and

3
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:36,940
see if it's legit don't know how to
proceed

4
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:49,300
happens everything is currently you have
a bit talking to self interest thoughts

5
00:04:49,300 --> 00:05:16,090
three companies limited method which is
this type of something

6
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:29,859
you have to be in the middle of the
traffic pretty pictures to work for the

7
00:05:29,860 --> 00:06:05,550
clients you're talking about the club
house that lacks the filter out here so

8
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:23,240
it's all part of a public key and the
words of the clients in the heat of the

9
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:43,620
day to the weather service has ok I'm
not home and it's it's ridiculous and

10
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:53,840
this message was received and stuff like
that someone is in the middle because

11
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,830
you get to communicate

12
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:46,250
and it's something with the filters and
injected certificate from the standpoint

13
00:07:46,250 --> 00:08:03,410
of the team is important because
basically stops this entire process this

14
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:39,290
is precisely what bill in the house one
this message and that's in the operating

15
00:08:39,289 --> 00:09:01,860
system in the UK you can do it in stock

16
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:24,970
and so it's a good thing for privacy
over the great when it comes to climate

17
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:35,810
and it looks and acts as a certificate

18
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:53,290
the pencil in my closet it's finished
it's over today

19
00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:08,779
these are the companies in which they
all doing it because of privacy they

20
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:21,589
want to keep their users probably don't
want to come out and say that day but

21
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:43,990
needing to change the way we picked me
up feat

22
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:57,089
to very little about technological

23
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:16,820
it's no great on the site when you get
so who do you like to make because you

24
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:47,600
can go to the websites that are
realizing it into a website to these

25
00:11:47,600 --> 00:12:11,930
videos or maybe but there's also
something which new technologies so it's

26
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:26,920
time to change the way we think it's
time to change these teachers

27
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
administrators

28
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:49,089
this is what do you think of something
changed Google which takes world's

29
00:12:49,089 --> 00:13:12,400
capability to filter now we can take
search after the only these videos they

30
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,990
can't get to anything else

31
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:44,420
work now so there is ways to do this is
what to do this but class you know what

32
00:13:44,420 --> 00:14:11,810
that means the kids so sometimes I can't
control the rest of the back in nineteen

33
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:36,739
there was no we didn't have the schools
did not come to school districts there

34
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,920
was very little impact

35
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,579
do you can supervisors

36
00:14:47,579 --> 00:15:01,489
dealt with those issues that they have
created this monster that some

37
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:32,750
technology can do it we can take it can
we get a room with school and they're in

38
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,310
the bedroom

39
00:15:34,310 --> 00:16:05,268
you know katie is the only way to stop
it is 70% 30% technology but the only

40
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:33,640
thing that's going to stop he can do and
we think it's only do anything with no

41
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,600
longer

42
00:16:40,600 --> 00:17:35,030
kids can view on this

43
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,860
tell you
