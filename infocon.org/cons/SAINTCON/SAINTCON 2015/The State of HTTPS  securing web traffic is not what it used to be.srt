1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,439
dozens of us right now

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:13,929
today the deployment of a CBS summary
should be used for everything there is

3
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:19,440
no longer non-sensitive web traffic
should be a default this is probably old

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,380
news to many of you are obvious to some
but hopefully to those who is not wake

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,040
you up to

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,320
to icrc default everything please make
you aware of with the way the web is

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:45,480
moving myself Jon Jarvis independence
very enthusiastic yes on my own time

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,218
it's not a job for me not yet come to
take on for a few years 2013 is awesome

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,510
you have to be at last year I did
presentation on consumer drones uses and

10
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,780
misuses of them and how can it be abused
or penetration testing this young

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,700
talking about 80 DPS website to advocate
advocate for it called secure Utah dot

12
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:25,000
org and my philosophy we need all the
users I'm here to defend themselves so

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:43,660
everything we thought to be online we
PDF 421 being loaded later today because

14
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,560
your interests

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,370
look it up later I'm gonna skip over
some technical details and nuances just

16
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,310
and stay focus I do touch on some stuff

17
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,810
documents

18
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,890
this is a lot to clean presentation his
name was revealed as summarized my

19
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,720
preferred to some of the links deal to
pacify material so many here as parents

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,410
do so

21
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:23,500
jeopardize that likewise I'm making the
best effort accuracy so I do my best to

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,440
do my homework forget something wrong

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,910
well means person by email

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:39,620
let's discuss it later correction so I
like this talk of the background and

25
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,610
disclaimer about HTTPS what is for what
it can do then go into the abuses of a

26
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:57,410
CTP common in Texas City DPS and cases
for which is pretty long as I'm excited

27
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:09,310
about the future how we can apply to
adhere to YouTube and pretty said

28
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,140
researcher said it one of his
presentations and robust tweets from its

29
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:24,458
creators quote smolder smart guys seems
to work well for me presentations here

30
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,209
but there's a summarized what is
integrity make sure you get with the

31
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,980
Service and Privacy you're the only one
who opened it and I think to the server

32
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:45,018
is who they claim to be pretty simple
but has a very targeted user base is a

33
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,579
quote from a woman named in Boulder who
works for get her wonderful story

34
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:58,090
reckoned in reading again just arguing
in favor of basic ass everywhere

35
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,260
college debt

36
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,489
not necessary but has been good to know
details as a technical targets for

37
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:13,879
high-level HTTP or HTTPS and essentially
HTTP server TLS first step is a tunnel

38
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,440
is created between you and server asked
about traffic flows because the internet

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
is an insecure network is designed that
way you don't know where your dad is

40
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,030
going you don't know who's going to look
at it on the way how tell us who works

41
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,739
at least there's a good explanation of
it this afternoon so but has a target 3

42
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,460
p.m. to technical details

43
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,590
recommend coming to that certificate
authority is they've got problems I'm

44
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,869
not going to go into that it's a big can
of worms but it's tomorrow we have

45
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,940
mostly works as a whole new the talk but
one thing I do like to bring up a

46
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,590
season-best doing this they do
certificate pruning meaning the default

47
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,609
search that are installed a new OS
sometimes don't need you need addresses

48
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,120
from Brazil France sometimes we just
installed by default in some companies

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
will remove those just reduced the
attack service employees computers

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:36,300
networks whatever after that was release
logical started paying attention to it

51
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,930
yet there started campaign lots of good
article coming out in paperback

52
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,010
advocating for it however at the time
they support the same thing privacy

53
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,870
integrity however there were some
definite technical hurdles that we

54
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:56,930
stopped for adoption so there was an
uptake in an uptick in

55
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:06,320
websites using it now widespread
adoption so cryptic communication few

56
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,060
notes on that Indian christen that's so
hot right now that's what you want to be

57
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,669
doing a lot of services lot of ads to do
in user to server and could soon and

58
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,690
then a passenger service and service the
recipient that's not good is a server

59
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,310
can be back toward can be complete in
some way so for communication is HTTPS

60
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:36,509
email as minor as soon as employees use
applications by mister systems great

61
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:43,440
company whether Android or iOS they have
apps apps use off the record message in

62
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,820
Iraq slow directing and crippled things
just another website that has more

63
00:06:48,820 --> 00:07:00,310
information for people to get what we
can do to protect yourself is using the

64
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,810
NSA or some other entity that's going to
be a flag protection not so much because

65
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,760
you're an American suspicious because
they don't know what it is they don't

66
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,080
know what the content is stepping down
as they can't excluded because I know

67
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,820
you're American be collected to cripple
and I just know that could be

68
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,229
communication right now has a higher
chance of being collected but the answer

69
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,900
to that as aggressors great your
outpouring contribute to the covered

70
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,859
make everything didn't make it normal to
make it stand out this great your

71
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,820
camouflage encrypted into the only one I
can help you quit Side Story 2013

72
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:50,240
Harvard student in one take a final exam
in a bomb threat overt or service or

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,780
tracks that way however when the FBI
investigated it and looked at the

74
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,989
Harvard wireless network there was only
one person using tor morning

75
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:10,160
they approached him to confess with
encryption you're much better off plain

76
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,230
text people whose about what's going on

77
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:36,200
does not do all that metadata is
recorded it can lead to traffic analysis

78
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,730
attacks said he's on how web pages can
still do what they are even over a CBS

79
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:49,860
channel based on different sizes the
dynamic website transfers of data you

80
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,360
can finger print web site web pages and
sometimes with high accuracy is your

81
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,880
patient enough and your homework DNS
requests bring your proposal DNS over

82
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,560
TLS IETF draft is like two weeks old

83
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:17,900
latest draft since they kill us

84
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:29,150
has happened and I i think is brand new
and maybe but you probably know more

85
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,160
this next year I was necessary from a
CBS what has to happen for us so just

86
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:46,699
another way to leak itself does not
protect that at all if it's leaked it's

87
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,660
broken and so we have to get used to
target they can be grouped into

88
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:02,180
4400 teens keys every day every week so
there is some sort of the entire traffic

89
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:15,640
isn't until 2030 2011 2012 two notable
problems with CA's where some of the

90
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,250
agency was well as ticket was issued
that shouldn't have been responsive that

91
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,760
Google created this transparency project
website Cty seine net is a public water

92
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,980
all around there's an added actually
worked on semantic accidentally issue in

93
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,440
the search for google.com because of
these logs so really it's just security

94
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,190
should be audited should be open source
is this a good example of public

95
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,680
information being used to make something
more secure your problems with

96
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,959
certificates really any ch New Zealand
certificate for any website they don't

97
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,800
be certain but it can happen as what
happened with that did you know tire so

98
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,640
that you can get one CA only one chus
difficult for google.com and that's what

99
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,990
public keeping those other potential to
criticize access to it so it can work

100
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:26,339
with a well be careful when it

101
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:43,059
client again just for the verification
of distributed fairly remote

102
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:50,829
extensions an added onto a CBS help
increase the security doesn't prevent

103
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:56,378
these certs convincing domains can get
certificates because it's Catholic

104
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,439
doesn't mean it's not legitimate content
company called Nick crafted web site and

105
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:06,910
Alice's complaining about this visit
sites gift certificates should prevent

106
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,620
this

107
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,649
someone should stop it was kinda outside
exactly what what significance or

108
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,999
environmental or so it's kind of like
the fact that users don't know what to

109
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:24,860
do and what protects against likewise
mobile browsers sometimes a green icon

110
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:40,519
cream bar is displayed so you're
connected over and against cancer back

111
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:48,550
toward your own server doesn't seek us
out there that's what you want but not

112
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,620
begins things that are not because the
internet really this is going to reduce

113
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:02,110
security the next 10 years all the ways
it's gonna go round but these two quotes

114
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,209
some of my seat for me why is a free to
validating or so

115
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:20,449
home you know cold blast of air you're
okay so things that does not protect

116
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:27,099
against what is it good for dinner cases
every time I see free wi-fi that's a

117
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,899
sign that goes on in my head i watch out
it's free wifi because of traffic that's

118
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,939
going on

119
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,449
access point to be looking at what
you're doing people tracking you as move

120
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,628
across different websites ISPs are
looking for traffic is you across our

121
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:50,920
network entities that might happen to
the backbone of the internet and to

122
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,099
monitor it anyone's gonna mess with you
during your cooking those are

123
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:03,160
unfortunate malicious people injecting
adds anything and nations he just want

124
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,879
to get all up in your business so again
you really need a CBS verifies you're

125
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,959
talking to a user to talking to you

126
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:24,258
defense against tampering really the
position i'm taking here is not using

127
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:30,110
HTTPS what's why you not implemented
because there's no technical reason not

128
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,730
to do at this time is now just for me my
family matter of willpower of course I

129
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,850
don't know your demands you haven't
managed one company that does you know

130
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:50,899
best but at least they considered it's
time to switch OES for everybody

131
00:14:50,899 --> 00:15:06,759
your special website owners or other
entities there's a nice reason to

132
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:13,429
refrain from 2006 great website the
upside down turn it essentially what do

133
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:22,540
you want some free wi-fi blocking off
traffic ticket MAC address and would

134
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,050
slip everything is upside down just
harmless fun make you worry you could

135
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:37,290
replace everything with kittens have fun
you can have however ISPs obviously take

136
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,069
a different approach it was my time here
quick know that everything here is is

137
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,118
focused on us' if I was given this hard
in different countries different

138
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:59,079
examples different emphasis on different
things so cute I and U S Video ISP will

139
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,209
be tracking users to interact
advertising tracking users to locate

140
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:09,989
them so you could tell them to prison
for government-related ISP looking us'

141
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,709
it seems to be limited to tracking for
advertising purposes there are a ton of

142
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:20,319
examples of its goin on our backs 2008
inspection to sell targeted ads

143
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:29,889
JavaScript like this just the norm rice
peas a company that actually sold wifi

144
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,360
monetization strategies

145
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:43,730
recapitalize injecting as well do it for
easy access points at the end of month

146
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,689
ago eighteen others were injecting
tracker tracking beacons and all mobile

147
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:55,319
traffic after leave your phone in your
network

148
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:03,440
advertising partners seat is coming to
them so if you have AT&T rising

149
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,980
definitely the website lessons learned

150
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,810
best see if it's going to be in his
presence articles to read more here to

151
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:19,379
find out more about it it's an opt-in or
opt-out service right now but it goes on

152
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,530
to essentially it's it's attracting I T
and get an ad network that's cross those

153
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:36,330
websites track any public montana
behavior and track users around comcast

154
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,520
also just two examples that I found
quickly exec magazine you data caps

155
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:50,370
almost user your bill is late try and
use the WiFi point where we go

156
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:57,310
JavaScript to temples I pulled there are
so many out there people noticing this

157
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,750
and I didn't find it when all this
happened because this is possible

158
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:12,410
because it's all people coming over HTTP
nice reminders I mean it's it's it's

159
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:22,010
widespread prevalence so another reason
for HTTP nation states like it you can

160
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:29,830
see the whole network maybe you're not
too nasty nation state and used to

161
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:37,760
target tracking target injection and its
capabilities revealed 2013 Canada UK's

162
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,890
signal intelligence agencies also done
some stuff in the same thing I mean you

163
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,309
find a way to track people across the
way because they had access to so many

164
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:58,149
nodes in the network that last image
there is a shot of light from a keen

165
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:05,789
they got really owned this summer and
won this one of their resumes exploits

166
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:15,200
over HTTP to get your targets so this
was an interesting you say I did you

167
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,769
think about until after I started
researching this some governments like

168
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:30,860
to censor what their their their
residents look at examples

169
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,779
website is a good prices content not
just like a thing but maybe a video for

170
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:43,789
impose some small person website was
like to have a website Wikipedia they

171
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:50,379
couldn't walk one page website which I
get up so they tried to buy part of it

172
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:57,779
and it didn't work and the point of
getting to this quote again from then

173
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,980
bolted the last night it was to me the
CTS is about more than keeping things

174
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,960
hidden about keeping things seen entire
website is over HTTPS they can suck a

175
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,419
black one page every block the entire
thing is that way you know this is jeff

176
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:22,809
is happening you can see it happening
over HTTP and as one page that she

177
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:27,139
doesn't like they can be great that page
they can in certain content they can do

178
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:32,590
something a bit more so everything over
HTTPS then such a surprise is blatant

179
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:40,129
and can be challenged were recorded and
served

180
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:50,030
so easy to get my protocol protocol that
be on the edge routers using my networks

181
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,440
you to communicate with each other and
tell you when you get two different IP

182
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:01,870
addresses very insecure in a lot of a
2008 YouTube went dark for most of the

183
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,729
world content so they essentially
publishing you round tables for you to

184
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,750
YouTube that's according to Pakistan for
a while until I figure out what was

185
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,960
going on

186
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,010
demonstrated that and again just a few
examples in the most recent years

187
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:28,250
happens where traffic gets routed out
somewhere and go again its net is an

188
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,010
insecure network you don't know where it
is going to go

189
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:43,580
KCBS can help protect you want to go
somewhere you expecting a 2002

190
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,590
so this isn't as much of a problem than
us' the web traffic you carry you want

191
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,330
to analyze it

192
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,310
USA has no mandatory data retention
that's a good thing except you consider

193
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,570
that nearly every ISP will hand over
data with a warrant subpoena or

194
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:09,030
sometimes it's nice to use we give us
that we're just gonna be aware of and

195
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,830
not trying to

196
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:16,399
don't be scared of Comcast other reasons
be spared him but not like what you wear

197
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,270
your data is stored as 280 days since
early when I could find someone specific

198
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,720
exhibition is awesome as always be
confirmed by email don't like anything

199
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:37,060
there traffic traffic is these various
amounts of logging but we do retain some

200
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:46,210
information what I say he addressed to
what website where you can search for

201
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,250
something go to encrypted web site after
that go somewhere else

202
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,660
what someone was looking for it we're
looking at sort of parts of your your

203
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:01,430
activity and some aren't metadata
collection in France traffic analysis

204
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,430
can be done

205
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:11,170
see what you doing here where it's just
recorded retained it every year

206
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,350
privacy policies privacy policies can
change is if you're just assume

207
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:23,750
everything you do is track and watch

208
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:36,960
for website owners that are probably
known to many people in the past 12

209
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,080
creases server performance overhead its
extra cycles computing google has a

210
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,389
website with the website is still as
fast essentially yes it is these days

211
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,900
can handle it could have been improved
this is not a strong objection more

212
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,860
hands-on experience with this but I'm
relying on other experts here to say

213
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,899
it's possible to do this so my point
again at least mister service and less a

214
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:16,720
first for just rejecting that is kind of
an older excuse it has been gone by the

215
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:28,940
wayside Ave apts sharing domains hosting
essentially website interesting that s

216
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:38,490
and I smile analysis is looks at what is
the main aim or hidden encrypted now so

217
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:46,570
it wouldn't another reason why websites
don't do it can serve those wonderful

218
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,419
kisses advertising as a time when
there's so much and really right now

219
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,840
that's a good thing for obvious reasons
I'm sure the one has noticed that going

220
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,189
on your mobile websites are filled with
that sometimes York Times article about

221
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,700
how some websites are 50% adds that's
half your data being used for

222
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,170
advertising that you're paying for your
leasing article in Bloomberg Business on

223
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:20,920
the economy is full of click fraud
network sixer malware I mean I could

224
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,250
pick any number of a dozen events in the
past year the point is I had networks

225
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,830
malware

226
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:36,918
in other news guys will sweat it happens
the norm now because it's over HTTP or

227
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,820
because it's and there was a compromise
between eighty HTTPS is one way to stop

228
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:52,539
sorry some people don't swing state
issue DPS because they can maintain

229
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:58,450
their revenue comes from their ad
networks google has go to support as

230
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:05,399
over SSL should be linked their kind of
his with executives came out saying no

231
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:10,199
we've got to change this obviously their
hands

232
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,860
existing to the reality of Evan plucking
them the IAB is Interactive Advertising

233
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,580
Bureau two weeks ago they had a
statement a mess up our ads are bad we

234
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,470
know it must change it was trying to do
more lightweight encrypted just make it

235
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:38,190
more user more user choice and able to
post content principles for content

236
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,340
walking since the principles for
determining why and how content to block

237
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,879
the browser

238
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:53,970
the center of the process so they use
these principles for how we're going to

239
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:00,529
develop our browsers our products have
restructured we work we do and this is

240
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:07,980
kind of comic right now has a plan to
allow content walking the browser

241
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,290
so again there's people walk as their
bad but the industry is changing to

242
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,740
allow for you

243
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:26,390
over HTTPS against some great quotes Dec
20 website websites arrived to do that

244
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,910
but the reactions are so great I mean
I'm sorry want to execute random told

245
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,410
that you know where it comes from my
machine that's how you make money

246
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:46,600
directly to rate comparisons and see you
next week its network of networks use

247
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:58,780
the same basic techniques based tickets
cost money right now let's encrypt is

248
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,540
now invaded a partner with Akamai to
their customers I think I've heard

249
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,928
hundreds of websites that are receiving
certificates with them it's basically

250
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:17,850
certificate for three anyone who wants
it to make it as simple as possible

251
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,020
started this offers research has its own
made up as we see it serves a bundle and

252
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:35,179
features and services to justify the
cost so concerned or get one obviously

253
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:42,100
not easy however it is hard but now
there's there's guides everywhere you

254
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,980
can search online for almost every
situation how do I install it sir how do

255
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:58,669
I maintain it has a built in their
office near universal universal notice

256
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:07,130
the question mark if you don't have SSL
and TLS between you and them even though

257
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:14,730
it is from here to visit our web host
shared hosting register as they offer

258
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,010
guys how to install a secret

259
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,480
it's not hard to figure out how to get
one up and running for simple sites I

260
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,230
see the pic I really do but it's just an
example of what these few websites USS

261
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,260
Cole and semantic domain name in the
report

262
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,930
see what what secretary using that you
shouldn't what used to be upgraded know

263
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:45,240
what's wrong with with great body great
for understanding and great for pointing

264
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:56,910
out website hey did you fix this this is
fixed your sis 11.com and symantec has

265
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,650
got a really long wing

266
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:36,610
available for download today are you
available on slides also right now

267
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:51,909
start it's it's out there is you need it

268
00:30:51,910 --> 00:31:00,240
deployed and and HTTPS

269
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,850
people get confused by the warnings they
see errors happen has been a big problem

270
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:15,530
chrome is handed in his past year
examples from earlier this year where

271
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,770
they have some of their warnings up on
top of the old season 1 the bottom I was

272
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,510
making it more easier to understand
abusing make the right choice

273
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:29,549
PDF and the video link to that research
is interesting the hearing to user

274
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,200
experience and user interface

275
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,169
going process obviously people want
morning suit to work so chrome is aware

276
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:44,429
of that working on it scrupulous where
that likewise I just need to change how

277
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:51,460
easy to BS websites are displayed you
remove the yellow icon Nico seems pop up

278
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,840
on websites how it's a CBS but there's
no Greenock why because there's a reason

279
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,070
it is using the week

280
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:06,200
cipher got it should be expiring soon
what is no longer marked as pure as its

281
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:14,780
not fully secured my security should be
in as it could be richly website bad as

282
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,330
a sold-out combats tests your browser

283
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:24,040
shows a browser reacts to different from
that happen elsewhere in the address bar

284
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,690
morning that might come up so it's just
a whole lot of use cases when it

285
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:37,799
encounters a SSL certificate that's not
implemented correctly

286
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,179
not so much an objection the website
owner but for the people who handle

287
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:51,669
corporate networks so if you have to
respect traffic you'll find a way to do

288
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,399
it

289
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,350
domains of these selective description
if you have a website to find a way to

290
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,149
do it really worried about my website
will be accessed by such and such crowd

291
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:11,738
they need to find a way to get to it and
lastly indifference and read some people

292
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:16,950
who like to do it I don't care and like
I said this might have been excused

293
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,519
right now with for a number of reasons
I'm getting a second really I don't buy

294
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:29,169
anymore I'm making a judgment here that
website now is the time to switch to you

295
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:39,129
don't want to do it and find someone who
does maybe you like before taking a

296
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:45,719
position because when researching this I
kept coming across new reasons to nearly

297
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,230
CBS justifications for it but equally
resonate with anyone who owns a website

298
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,840
or likes to serve content

299
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:21,679
obvious connections to stop someone from
http to your website name

300
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,418
downgraded Jackson somewhere in the
middle stripping that encryption service

301
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,429
ID and it sent to the client base it on
the client can only connect to me the

302
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:38,950
ACPs something called me just years
freeloading this is too is not on the

303
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:43,830
client-side chrome goes this from your
website you say hey this is a browser

304
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:54,098
web site HTTPS so chrome has built in
most websites that you can actually it's

305
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,869
great for like you know government sites
financial site some long-term you know

306
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:05,589
you can maintain the client service on
this connect to make sure that they sit

307
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:15,440
ups happens and supported by all major
browsers this website if you do any kind

308
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:25,240
of web development web site called can I
use dot com really cool stuff like that

309
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:34,500
compatible in the press will be
compatible and I'm certain you they're

310
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,190
available right now you can take
advantage of them really limited

311
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:45,250
technical hurdles to take advantage of
HTTPS so browsers themselves are moving

312
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:55,760
away from http the kind of picked up
some dust and defecating on security CTP

313
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,130
since they're committed to focus it what
it means

314
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,710
with a prisoner was a community-focused
scene

315
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,260
new development efforts on secure web
and to start moving capabilities from a

316
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:15,940
non secure web 281 break is just going
forward we're gonna focus on encrypted

317
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,570
communication so when they accuse that
was on the website then read one of them

318
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:29,070
is nothing secret on my site why should
I bother with encryption HTTPS isn't

319
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,650
just about encryption it also provides
integrity you can be modified and

320
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,400
authentication so users know they're
taking to you and not as an attacker

321
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,670
lacking any of these properties to cause
problems in other words as long as your

322
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,540
site is not secure it can be used as a
weapon against abusers and against other

323
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:58,570
websites more not if your site's overall
deprecating ACP explain it but it's

324
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:04,119
moving away from its not my mind since I
can happen like next year but this is a

325
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:10,220
t-shirt how was this is the way its grip
it only affected and dCTP hopefully will

326
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:17,919
fall by the wayside niceties likewise
chromium security team also wants to

327
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,339
change the icon browser http be marked
with this icon it'll be explicitly shown

328
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:30,430
as non-secure so people are aware of it
was also Tuesday to you I like that are

329
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,368
kind of big people think about things so
we searched going to websites and

330
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:45,540
non-secure reactor that again though say
the timeline is having made a statement

331
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:59,310
that I could find about HTTP but follow
the WTC caisson about them is the World

332
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:06,960
Wide Web Consortium beer since the
industry's standards bodies that should

333
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,010
define protocols and roadmaps and how
things to be done

334
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:16,380
credit for the way they had a number of
statements come out about various ways

335
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:24,610
to improve web site security and
education this year upgrading security

336
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:31,810
West sweeper website say you have a news
website you got eight years of web site

337
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:37,860
web pages all kinds of things are hard
could it be the domain as coming in

338
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:43,860
those cases of URLs as if they're HTTPS
the resources are served over HTTPS

339
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:52,160
links don't say it was just a speedy pas
to save the website to go back and redo

340
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:01,890
hundreds and hundreds of web pages to
play it again another way that browsers

341
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,609
and what's that gonna start working
towards making everything served over

342
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:15,200
HTTPS so it can also reduce tracking on
simpson meaning not authorized by the

343
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,870
user or by the website owner 3 seed they
tagged with a technical architecture

344
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,790
group they made a statement on 16
Trenton on simpson's tracking is harmful

345
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:34,970
is not under the control of users and
not transparent and PCR are big on user

346
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,750
by end user choice to be aware of what
you're doing what's happening to you

347
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,360
online and then sanctions tracking that
is going on

348
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,850
consent to the use these statements
these principles to guide their

349
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:56,180
development again going back to the rise
in with a well that's huge customer base

350
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,009
a huge tracking they combine that with
Apple and Google had ideas you've got a

351
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:08,700
really attacking capabilities that
that's going on which they can't do that

352
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:16,828
if you cancel website vs

353
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:43,099
guys sharing things to know national
security what you want to show your kids

354
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:49,410
details that situation we don't want all
disclosure but if it happens to be able

355
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,859
to know what's happening too talented
passionate observe it so principal and

356
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:02,940
I'm against it any GPS it does help stop
that happening that censorship some

357
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,799
websites

358
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:15,890
a lot of us have before the network is
essentially hostile consider that that

359
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,489
that way and that appropriately Matthew
green is equipped with a cryptographer

360
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,910
for work he works at John Hopkins
University he's got a great blog about

361
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:32,249
photography and security applications to
post hostile reaction to relations

362
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:42,479
between AT&T and NSA be coming out there
is no network security third parties

363
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:47,140
responsible family man having your data
network to ensure that we looked at miss

364
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:57,390
you and your self destruction to go into
you say was something we can't suspected

365
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,469
knew about this you like hard evidence
of it you know you're like wow that I

366
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:08,029
didn't realize it was that bad that much
goes on as long post and I recommend

367
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:11,499
reading that network monitoring by
tennessee is again one of the topics

368
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:17,769
that you once is going to either way
good looking at the ramifications of

369
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,839
everything approach to surveillance and
how

370
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:29,670
in SA has its faults but they're doing
it that don't have some protections and

371
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,819
checks and balances it does have
happened elsewhere a dozen other

372
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:44,779
countries will follow suit from East
Orosi back in to the network is filled

373
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:50,190
with malevolent entities in Pakistan
have the worst possible effect according

374
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:58,440
to extend it again as possible is routed
to BCP attacks happen without warning

375
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:09,749
without you knowing about it can be
militias must have facebook facebook

376
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:19,769
engineer saying i'm talking on a tour in
server same applies to https users so do

377
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:28,038
this for them make it easier because
he's a friend to connect you with a lot

378
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:34,650
of contents on a try to go again with
every elected you don't know what might

379
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:41,259
be suspicious or win great post from a
security researcher has something to

380
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:51,710
hide you know it's not have nothing to
hide my months passed just because it's

381
00:43:51,710 --> 00:44:02,740
supposed to help you increase the
privacy of your YouTube

382
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:14,330
big example here is three years ago the
website information and it will be

383
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,790
difficult location of its awesomeness
and find out information that a user

384
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:25,670
sensitive and private sector taken to
task for example of information leaking

385
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:33,000
at financial is not you know high
security stuff but it is sensitive and

386
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,060
making a list of making this list
there's all kinds of topics that could

387
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,690
have included some say anything that
could be politically sensitive could be

388
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,210
stigmatized in some way that you don't
want people to know you're looking at

389
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:51,040
Google search history for example is a
common thing that I found out your

390
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,290
browsing history some people have
expectations of privacy that they

391
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:04,460
shouldn't but look at online is not
repealed and is to be a super over

392
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:12,340
websites of privacy to anyone looking at
the information you provide again

393
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:18,900
long list of things that you want a
protected with politics with with you

394
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,770
looking for help

395
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:28,310
look at the news you know what are
tracked and put together to get their

396
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:34,070
profile on doing anything with security
you want to make sure you get a clean

397
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,500
ISO download the white paper download is

398
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:44,880
is not been corrected so everyone is
doing it again all these standards wires

399
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,050
coming out saying how it should be

400
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:55,250
should be enabled it needs to happen all
the links on himself to read about these

401
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:01,570
are people who helped save the web is
built house handle major web companies

402
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:09,200
moonies UPS website has switched over
they've got big needs are used for such

403
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:17,339
a challenge is that after the amount but
it's happening UPS wats down there the

404
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:24,730
bottom and quality goals will track the
adoption of EVs many websites just wait

405
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,680
to see what's going on

406
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:38,160
examples of media and blogs which to it
and go to hear Google+ squad posed to

407
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:47,319
you by default so justification from
these websites and blogs privacy

408
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,570
security integrity I since I mean it's
all the same things are heating up

409
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,380
buying into it you don't use all sides
during a trip to the posture can

410
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,960
security serious websites that are
making this change because they believe

411
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:11,890
in the federal government earlier this
year made it was released what they

412
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,900
called a CBS only standard essentially
all with federal websites by the end of

413
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,600
next year

414
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,569
need to be served over HTTPS transport
security enabled everything so moving

415
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:33,430
out of government to make that happen to
be the same stuff I said before no such

416
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,129
thing as nonsensical web traffic

417
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:41,370
everything to be considered sensitive

418
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:45,960
by next year the gold have everything
over HTTPS and it is a good option

419
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,260
already they have their own tracker
attracted outmoded good news is this is

420
00:47:53,260 --> 00:48:02,370
this is on get hurt it's open source for
customized come back then the second

421
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:09,980
again I'll talk about the website owners
what they have to do their best to and

422
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,710
why they should do it and what is it
with a CBS for clients is pretty easy

423
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:21,730
update your browser BOS and usually
covered tester browser to see you can

424
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:27,520
connect correctly couple things HTTPS
Everywhere extension forces HTTPS

425
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,580
connection to happen you block origin is
just an extension that blocks

426
00:48:32,580 --> 00:49:40,569
advertising websites so HTTPS can be

435
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:45,009
level federal level yes eighty percent
of missing is happening but nothing on

436

the sale of a business that is what is
the world's oldest said it's responsive

437

engineer and convincing make it

443
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:42,200

sensitive content I'm gonna be seeking

444
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,689
out really all kinds of events people
are different in different groups

445
