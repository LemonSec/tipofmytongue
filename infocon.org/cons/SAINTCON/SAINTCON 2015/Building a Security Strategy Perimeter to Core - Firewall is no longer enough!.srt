1
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,090
okay thanks for attending the session to
session titled building a security

2
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,150
strategy perimeter decor firewall is no
longer enough we're gonna explore

3
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,729
several elements on the network firewall
of course being one of them

4
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:10,990
the access media switches wireless VPN
will also talk about an indication

5
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,440
Indian Point integrity and then the
visibility an audit trail that goes with

6
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,420
that all of it kinda designed to work
together

7
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,410
wanna talk a little bit about the threat
landscape what's going on out in the

8
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,649
world that we live in and how are
addressing that production companies try

9
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:33,030
roberts I'm with Jordan it I run their
secure wireless access technologies

10
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,850
division so everything that accesses a
network using come through one of the

11
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,140
technologies of my groups and charges so
hopefully as we go through this what I

12
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,619
want to share with you guys are some of
the best practices that we're seeing out

13
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,789
in the industry how are people securing
their network outside of just the

14
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,130
firewall some of the things that they're
leveraging some of the technology that's

15
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,350
available today and the take away that I
hope you guys leave with is how to put

16
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,598
together a strategy whether you're there
today we're trying to get to that

17
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,340
security that sense of security that you
need in your network if you're not there

18
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,410
hopefully I'll share some ideas to give
you a great plan to execute against and

19
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,230
show you some stuff that's actionable
everything that is out there today and

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,989
for some of the previous session great
examples some of the breaches interests

21
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,880
that are in the world that we live in
today we're gonna take a look at some of

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,519
those are going to look at what the cost
of some of those breaches are there

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,390
penetrating the network and make sure
that as we examine the different

24
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,500
elements along the network path that we
talk about some of the things that can

25
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,739
be done to prevent this so we're gonna
look at really four key areas we're

26
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,300
gonna look at next-generation firewall
and unified threat management look at

27
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,230
the LAN and wireless LAN onboarding and
then in 2010 gritty I can't really want

28
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,619
to share with you guys what

29
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,390
other people are doing and i guess i i
kind of you know in the title I had the

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,540
firewall was no longer enough I can't
compare this to the olden days if you

31
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,220
live in a castle and you have a moat and
a dropper it you're pretty good security

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,430
rating in the beginning because you're
gonna swim the most scale the wall and

33
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,400
attack the castle pretty tough to do
that with any type of force very similar

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,190
to the world that we live in now right

35
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,890
firewall used to be enough but even in
the days of castles and medieval knight

36
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,529
they develop certain things rate
archer's with arrows and other tools

37
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,129
they could attack this and launch
flaming balls into the courtyard of the

38
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:46,480
castle so pretty soon a modem driver age
or not enough and that's kind of the

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
world that we live in today

40
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,290
firewalls not enough great just having
something at the perimeter trying to

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,209
keep things out and not nearly enough to
level of security that will make us not

42
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,889
be vulnerable to threats that are out
there today so and to prove that we can

43
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,510
do a little math we can look at what's
going on and I only picked up one

44
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,899
protocol for today's examples and that's
the education vertical how much does an

45
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,918
average data breach in education you
would think well perhaps it doesn't cost

46
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,060
that much really I'm protecting our
student records staff records things

47
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,919
like that but we're gonna take a leopard
pony mom report the Institute report

48
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,198
that was commissioned by IBM and share
with you guys some of the costs of that

49
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,479
and then we'll look at a couple specific
examples and if you want to read how we

50
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,880
calculated the cost this is according to
the Ponemon Institute this is the method

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,510
used to calculate it a couple different
things in there are a lot of forensics

52
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,729
to clean up the mess once a breach has
been detected well the services that are

53
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:57,190
out sourced but there are a bunch of
indirect costs that are associated with

54
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,930
that will come to take a look at some of
those as we go through their these guys

55
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,860
used to formulate a figure out that in
the education vertical

56
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:15,310
data breach cost roughly $300 her record
that is reached so if we look at in 2014

57
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,729
the top 10 data breaches you can see
there and I apologize it's pretty small

58
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:26,280
University of Maryland College Park
309,000 record stolen 492 million

59
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,489
dollars that's just the cost $300 per
record and you can scroll down the risk

60
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,770
to lift and read some of those Indiana
University 246,000 records 43 minutes

61
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,020
twenty million dollars costs of that
data breeds they're very expensive and

62
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,818
very unpopular I think if we look back

63
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,620
2014 which was a huge year and data
breaches lots and lots of money being

64
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,439
spent

65
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,419
you did or breaches in when you are a
taxpayer paid into you becomes very

66
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:05,500
unpopular to have Peter breaches if we
take it down to a little bit more

67
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,729
regionalized example was gonna look at
some of the things that are going on in

68
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:15,080
the kids are 12 arena sweet as perot
over its school district

69
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,639
reached back in March of this year and
identified perpetrator it was ransomware

70
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,479
right oblique ripped the lockers
something like that and if you look at

71
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,758
what the impact was that's where really
the main point of the greetings in to

72
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,449
attack they were demanding 228,000 in
bitcoins there wasn't really any data

73
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,620
breach just files encrypted computers
have with data held hostage

74
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,469
crippled the school from taking Park
exams and point of sale lunch programs

75
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:53,599
were down a very inconvenient rate not
as much hard currency but definitely

76
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,080
inconvenient

77
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,839
New Brunswick North Carolina January
2015 students perpetrated the DDoS

78
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,689
attacks a distributed denial of service
attack on the school computer network

79
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,779
ports were overloaded and if you look at
the impact lost instructional time

80
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,180
decreased productivity inability to
execute

81
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,039
and that's really tough schools you're
all set up to do testing on a day and

82
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,120
you can no longer do it becomes tough
one close to a state school district in

83
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,229
Idaho and other targeted denial of
service attack intermittent access for

84
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,508
10 days across the district standardized
testing was interrupted many students

85
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:44,070
had to retake online exam we're seeing
this particular attack more and more

86
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,300
often so those of you that it looked at
like a detox protection system I'm going

87
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,060
to share with you a couple of things
that might scare even more about those

88
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,729
Denver Public Schools phishing attack on
the consideration for me talk a lot

89
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,500
about fishing you can see how easy
people are tripped into a phishing

90
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,740
attack rate this one targeted at teacher
seven employees click on the link it

91
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,020
cost 26 2010 lost paychecks and of
course then it forces everybody to go

92
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:19,680
change passwords and react to those data
breaches new drop high school student

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,000
perpetrator data breaches change grades
change scheduling access to network from

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,909
a smartphone and course anytime there's
a data breach like this what's the first

95
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,169
thing that happen people start to
question the data integrity right was

96
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,949
that change the data breach

97
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,089
relevant it still valid

98
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,360
high school data breach by students
again to students hacked into the

99
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,900
network attempted installing keystroke
logger software and student information

100
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,180
system then obviously the global
recession and all of the computers make

101
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,859
sure there's no heat stroke bloggers on
those reset all the passwords you know

102
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,410
if these data breaches in 2015 and
here's one from just two weeks ago

103
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:12,079
congress school district in Wisconsin
three weeks ago a group of students went

104
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:18,810
to IP stressor dot com and a $17 for a
denial of service attack you can do this

105
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,260
today any of us could go to IP stress or
dot com and for the cost of a week's

106
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,769
lunch money for a student

107
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:32,009
order denial of service attack question
I would ask is are you prepared to deal

108
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:38,089
with something on your primary IP
address for your primary and load

109
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:43,720
balanced IP addresses are you ready to
deal with this not to add insult to

110
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,429
injury and I didn't purposely make this
fine print but I captured one of the

111
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:56,499
pages out of an insurance policy
covering data breaches not really to

112
00:09:56,499 --> 00:10:02,279
scare you guys but the highlight that in
a data breach not everything is not

113
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,949
everything is covered and the cost
usually extend beyond whatever coverage

114
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:12,319
you have a great example think target
with a hundred million in coverage less

115
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,929
than 10 million self-insured retention
but the total data breach cost was two

116
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:21,420
hundred and fifty-two million and
believe me the 252 million that target

117
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,639
page to mop up after the data breach was
the chief part if you think about in the

118
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,730
case of target what was the customer
goodwill that was lost because if you

119
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,629
like me shop at Target how many guys
stop shopping at Target where at least

120
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,549
slow down for a period of time

121
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,959
write a bunch of us we felt violated it
was inconvenient that will cost target

122
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,489
far more money than the 252 million that
be spent to clean out so if you're a

123
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,990
normal business making that he'll just
get a good insurance policy that will

124
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,110
cover me for data breach that's not the
case it'll certainly covered help you

125
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:09,490
clean up but in most cases the entire
cost so what my goal is is to help you

126
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,860
guys understand how to avoid the data
breach some of the things that people in

127
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,699
the industry are doing to avoid that how
they're preparing their network what

128
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:22,049
they're building elements as and how
they're putting together a framework

129
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:27,739
that they can either grow into her get
to pretty rapidly so in education I'm

130
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:32,120
going to share this example with you and
I apologize at all

131
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,560
some of the writing I do have this this
is available as one of the presentations

132
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,520
doubts I have this in a one-page
document out of the four dinner table

133
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,000
out the lobby but this is our secure
student framework and what what I want

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,900
to do is walk through the different
elements of this show you some of the

135
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,360
features a secure student framework how
we piece it together how that might play

136
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,540
into some of the initiatives that you
guys are dealing with today and we hope

137
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,939
you guys figure out that you can build a
design that will keep you secure so we

138
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,750
start with firewall firewall is always
the core that has been in it probably

139
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,480
will be moving forward we're definitely
in today's world talking about next gen

140
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,730
firewall and next-generation firewalls a
little different than traditional fire

141
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,610
while it adds a couple element

142
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,370
application firewall intrusion
prevention so deep packet inspection

143
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,970
website filtering and anti-piracy bills
features have been added to your

144
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,980
traditional firewall and relabeled is a
next-generation firewall we're also

145
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,630
gonna talk about unified threat
management because most of the

146
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,689
next-generation firewalls today include
unified threat management and in unified

147
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,770
threat management what we've done is
we've brought together a lot of the

148
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,480
point products if you would go to the
web filtering maybe it was a standalone

149
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,410
product IPS antivirus grant them into
our next-generation firewall you can

150
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:12,270
platform collapse into a single box so
now you get all of these features in a

151
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,760
purpose-built appliance or maybe it
should be designed to do all of these

152
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,700
features the cool thing about bringing
all of these together and I'm not just

153
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,180
speaking up for tonight whether it's at
Palo Alto boxer checkpoint boxer 14 in

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,870
the cool thing about having all these
work to be in the same box is there they

155
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,200
are designed to work together so now
you've got things like bpm how control

156
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,970
IPs

157
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,720
web content filtering all designed to
work together and report back to each

158
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,980
other so that you can take security
action on those events that occur so

159
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,230
over the years it's been a little
challenging to make sure that that

160
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,579
correlation of information the activity
taking on the security events correlates

161
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,508
when there are put into the same
platform they're designed to work

162
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,540
together and do that so what we see is
that these new firewall these new

163
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,110
appliances are different from the old
one shoulder belt with standard CPUs now

164
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,110
we're seeing purpose-built 36 put into
these products as well to really

165
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,870
accelerate them to even though we
combine all of its into a UTM platform

166
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,420
we're putting additional processing
power whether that the network processor

167
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,329
speed up traffic or content processor to
do the things like IPS by her self

168
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:33,069
control in the same box so we're not
just taking a box and add more features

169
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:39,060
to it actually building a box it has
more content processing power more CPU

170
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,040
cycles to do that so now that I've got
my next firewall UTM appliance in place

171
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,879
but second question I would ask him and
a new type of technology that we're

172
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,439
seeing a lot of interest in me is the
question is one firewall enough that a

173
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:00,930
firewall at the head of my perimeter
protected do I need to start looking

174
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,670
statements some of the other portions of
my network with additional firewalls the

175
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,279
great thing about this is I don't
necessarily have to take as big a

176
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,730
firewall if I wanna segment office who
were division may be financed want to

177
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,850
put behind a second firewall we're
starting to see a lot more interest in

178
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,430
this and the reason is not just to break
up a network and segment it but it's to

179
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,250
provide the additional security services
that one division may need over another

180
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,069
there are some advantages to just take
medication it is much easier to breach

181
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:42,079
and exploit a flap network that it is a
segmented 10 just having a firewall on

182
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,800
the border is not enough

183
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,990
reflect that word

184
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,170
and if you start to take a look at some
of the attack vectors where threats come

185
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,399
from thats were internal segmentation
takes it makes a lot more sense right I

186
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,770
might have remote users might have
different cloud applications then I'm

187
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,579
going to placing some additional
firewalls and network two segments that

188
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,430
are gives you a lot more protection rate
cassini breach the perimeter firewall

189
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,989
but if they make it to the inside of my
network but any other division or

190
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,270
department because I've got a second
firewall in place that doubles my

191
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,470
chances of walking that exploit or that
threat so once I get my fire walls of

192
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,720
placing my perimeter firewall I got any
internal signet ASA firewalls in place

193
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,250
next thing in the framework to look at
is a look at the authentication and this

194
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,830
is where I see again this is a big part
of my world this is where I see a lot of

195
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,810
years over simplicity not enough
controls in place that enough policy

196
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,459
enforcement in place and a lot of times
it's very dependent upon a DHCP server

197
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,189
in Active Directory Server to provide
all of the authentication services and

198
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,520
features that are offered and I would
challenge that that there are other

199
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,949
services to offer multi-factor
authentication push-pull of certificate

200
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,589
or certificate based authentication self
registration there are other features

201
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:17,750
that augment at to keep the simplicity
but added layer protects and so take a

202
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,869
look at some of this one of my favorite
things is two factor authentication so I

203
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:27,849
would ask any and all you guys how many
you guys are using two factor

204
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:33,780
authentication on all your high tea
appliances and services certainly be

205
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,300
users but on the Active Directory
servers switches firewalls you guys

206
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,830
leverage two factor authentication get
some had not if you're not I would start

207
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,889
there it's a great place to have two
factor authentication make sure you know

208
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,320
who is accessing data

209
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,889
equipment and make sure there's at least
two methods of application required to

210
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:01,269
get into that service so strong
passwords are great

211
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:08,070
usually not enough especially in mission
critical equipment certificate authority

212
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:14,070
a lot of the authentication servers that
are out there today can also do be the

213
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,620
certificate authority I'm definitely a
believer in certificate authentication

214
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,229
info 21 X certificate based
authentication we are in an area now

215
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,350
where this has become simplified this
wasn't always an easy task to install

216
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,939
certificates on all types of machines
and make that process somewhat self

217
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,679
enrolling self registration or an area
now that you can do that where students

218
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,809
can bring in BYOD devices load their own
certificate except use policy and now

219
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,389
there are other network ID Act of the
directories or some other medications or

220
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:58,620
so a lot of interest around certificate
authority and all of the services that

221
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,739
go with them so once we get our
authentication in place then we take a

222
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,399
look at the accident media right so
we're listen switching and there's a lot

223
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:14,668
of different wireless out there we'll
talk a little bit about wireless and I

224
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,019
get a story goes one way or another but
you know with the Internet of Things of

225
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,070
all of the devices that are coming onto
the network we have finally passed the

226
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:29,610
amount of wired ports by wireless
devices 2015 was the year that we passed

227
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,969
when I come from a wireless background
we've been predicting that for years

228
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,490
that it would happen five or 10 years
ago but in 2015 IDC del Toro and some of

229
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,490
the other research companies confirmed
that we finally have surpassed the

230
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,070
amount of wired switchboards with
wireless devices and meddling in a group

231
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:53,120
right so is that is finals privilege
connection media what are you guys doing

232
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,090
to secure that you have everything in
place to do that there are several

233
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,679
different ways to do wireless controller
based wireless cloud-based wireless

234
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,870
private cloud public cloud and then
there's hybrids of that and each of

235
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:13,649
those brings with it its own set of
constants and negatives challenges as

236
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:19,580
well as benefits so I just kind of want
to walk through these there is a growing

237
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,889
interest in you've probably seen this in
some of the firewall vendors to have

238
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,160
firewall controlled wireless where the
firewall is the wireless LAN controller

239
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,080
and then there are those people that
make wireless LAN controller said have

240
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,260
firewall features so there is a lot of
security my personal preference is

241
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:45,140
controlled what we offer both ways just
so you know so it's not the company and

242
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,200
if it's my personal opinion has a lot of
things we can do in controlled wireless

243
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,910
community late the traffic that can't
necessarily do in cloud managed so in

244
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,090
this model and this particular model the
firewall is the controller could be a

245
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,320
regular controller sitting there traffic
is tunneled back to the controller we've

246
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,560
seen this type of technology for ten
plus years I've been doing Wireless is a

247
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,950
primary focus for over 10 years

248
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,800
controller subpoena round-tripper there
are some benefits in controller based

249
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,840
traffic all the traffic have to flow
back through the controller in some

250
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,459
cases especially with firewall
controlled it has to go through the

251
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,780
firewall before it can take any other
layer to traffic so get the policy of

252
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,710
course packet inspected application
controlled all of the security services

253
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,510
wreck happened right on the firewall so
great thing if you're looking for high

254
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,810
security wireless control this probably
gonna be your friend there is growing

255
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:48,750
demand in the cloud managed in the
controller list wifi there are a lot

256
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,990
more security services that are moving
to the AP itself

257
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,920
being able to do that at the edge of the
network challenged with this is it's

258
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,510
really tough of could face full deep
packet inspection engine on that EP

259
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,379
without consuming all of the CPU cycles
you have to build a purpose-built AP for

260
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,520
that you've got to have a lot of
processor multiple cores lots of memory

261
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,929
and now you're taking all of that deep
packet inspection inspecting every

262
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:25,650
packet pulling it apart looking for
viruses spyware malware spyware before

263
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,440
you left at traffic past so a little bit
of challenge in the club managed cloud

264
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,750
to greater reading for wireless internet
management of it having the security

265
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,350
services on the AP though it's critical
you gotta be able to do security

266
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,709
services at the edge security services
at the core and so we kind of look at

267
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:50,170
what the services our weather cloud
managed or controlled wireless many of

268
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,780
the services today at a virus right
that's a big one that's what we'll see

269
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,620
ideas are used for spyware malware but
we're content filtering again if I can

270
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,120
take the security services and do that
the firewall or do it at the edge hybrid

271
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,469
environment you attempt all I've really
got a highly of security and that's kind

272
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,230
of what I'm starting to see a lot more
customers migrate to is the solution

273
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,140
remaining security services for the
perimeter in the core IKEA's reputation

274
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,450
to your fencing a couple of new features
that are really having some impacted you

275
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,210
fencing not accepting packets from North
Korea Russia I ran you know really being

276
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,030
able to tell where the package come from

277
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,889
keep those out if they're not pertinent
to my office operation IP reputation

278
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:44,309
right command and control servers for
bob where spyware out only Internet zone

279
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:49,660
being able to tell that he had ideas
you've been used before I don't allow

280
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,440
any traffic ticket I could ever talk to
that time had a scheduling i mean you

281
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,679
guys run we'll just call 925 businesses
not open after six or seven guys have

282
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:08,629
have wireless shut off power of the day
at six o'clock if you don't great

283
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:13,820
opportunity to put them feature in place
no reason why you should be on after six

284
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,499
o'clock if you're never opened your bank
you're never open after six o'clock

285
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,059
right

286
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,230
Wiley wireless on all night so that
somebody can come to your party led him

287
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,070
to have a location-based taxes you have
your users to find a group to where they

288
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,879
can only login from certain points
little bit of administration to make

289
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,408
that happen but again if you're in a
very security-conscious environment

290
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:41,590
better to have controls like that
employs two factor authentication single

291
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,490
sign-on 802 annex all great things to
make sure your incorporating application

292
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,850
control this is kind of the next big
frontier become very popular in wireless

293
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,490
we're doing any wireless and LAN
switching being able to Deepak inspect

294
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,679
the traffic control it and it's not just
walking allow right cuz we had that for

295
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,860
some time but being able to do things
like that a quote on it so maybe I want

296
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,248
to allow people the option to use
Netflix Hulu or some sort of streaming

297
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:15,490
media but i wanna say hey you only get
eight minutes a day or you only get to

298
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,529
give the day being able to place a quota
met still allows me to be flexible to

299
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:28,249
offer that but we managed that or block
certain activities and block it a PC

300
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:33,190
application layer so nothing against
Facebook but maybe I won't allow reading

301
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,619
a facebook but I don't want to out
posting on Facebook or don't allow the

302
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:43,369
Farmingdale being able to do that at a
granular level in one of the things that

303
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,840
we're seeing is there's a lot of new
applications that come out every day

304
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,730
leveraging signature based application
profile II gives us the ability to have

305
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,769
a new application comes out

306
00:25:54,769 --> 00:26:00,619
posted new signature to traffic shaping
that protect against it immediately

307
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:07,369
hourly basis so that means you're not
dependent upon a perhaps or in an

308
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,879
upgrade to be able to see that so

309
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,460
having that in mind where lessons which
is great but we're also seeing I'm

310
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,570
switching trend is a lot of new and
enhanced features so we're starting to

311
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,510
see a lot of firewalls be able to manage
switches as well and join them into this

312
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,730
firewall policy important so i plug
switch into a firewall be able to manage

313
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,760
it directly from the firewall so take
policies that I created for wireless or

314
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,710
per user groups are device groups
pushing right down to the switch itself

315
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,270
so now when I plug an access point into
the switch the switch says hey I know

316
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,220
you're an access point and I will put
you on the access point he'll add turn

317
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,830
up your power I let you go to work or
plugin a student computer oh I recognize

318
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,790
you as a student computer put you on the
student feeling and not have any

319
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,050
securities concerns or at least a client
to rate security profile so that's kind

320
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,129
of the direction as switching is going
is to be able to be smart enough to know

321
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,850
when something goes into what it is in a
sign at the right profile in the

322
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,909
security environment very critical rate
is that what I don't wanna do is have a

323
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,800
student login and beyond the teacher
feeling and have access to resources on

324
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,649
that feeling Internet network
segmentation the greater thing though is

325
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:31,920
the security aspect in event correlation
they can take place on a switch that

326
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,060
managed firewall so what they've got a
user that it was part of one of the

327
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,950
phishing attacks that computers now
talking to a command-and-control server

328
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:47,600
outside the network I want backed
security event to be detected and then I

329
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,340
want my firewall to tell my switch
switch that user to remediation forward

330
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,639
or quarantine deal in shut them down and
take action on it said the user captive

331
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,110
portal that he's been his machine to
compromise and that he needs to update

332
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,919
as soon as security profile having that
level of event correlation at the switch

333
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,730
level brings yet another because of
security to switching that a lot of

334
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,310
companies are looking for so seeing a
lot of excitement in the industry about

335
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,320
this a lot of the switch hitters out

336
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,928
are making this a reality which this is
something in the twitching environment

337
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,679
that we've been looking forward to for
years right having that event

338
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:33,779
correlation and automatically taking
action on the switch port so we've

339
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,769
talked about access media don't want to
talk a little bit about the endpoint

340
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:41,779
security right so what do we do with
these guys we've talked about whether

341
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,630
it's a smartphone or tablet or laptop

342
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,950
we've talked about our perimeter
firewall how we protect the traffic

343
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,019
coming in about the axis media right
switching and wireless how they connect

344
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:58,509
to the network but how do I protect user
or if I've given that user that the bias

345
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:02,240
how do I protect me as the entities to
make sure that what happened on the

346
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,330
device is exactly what I'm looking for
so having strong endpoint security

347
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:12,279
employee protection should assist you in
credentialing and onboarding right if I

348
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:16,980
got a great in 20 protection system we
can assist with all those who care my

349
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:23,120
ups antivirus so having the best
solution there's usually a couple other

350
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,469
side benefits it can use it come with
some sort of BPM software definitely

351
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,019
does all of the access control we've
seen this today more in a unified

352
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:39,070
clients so a client that can do all of
this in one during spin agent but it's

353
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,120
on me in the machine itself very
important to have that Boehner bility

354
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,860
scanning right so making sure that every
kind of device connects to the network

355
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,600
it's checked

356
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,928
meet policy is running the latest copy
of the endpoint protection you know

357
00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:00,559
looking at that and then either sending
that devised to quarantine having it

358
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,379
updated security postures profile and
then allowing it onto the network is

359
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:11,699
probably one of the biggest things that
I see though is the logging and

360
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,919
reporting company you guys issue out
devices guys either give your employees

361
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,759
some sort of device so but you guys need
you know what they do when that device

362
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,309
goes off your network

363
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:32,690
you guys would like to know if they do
that devices on your network if you're a

364
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:40,879
state agency for some added the history
respond to some sort of regulatory

365
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:46,090
compliance hit the PCI SOX compliance
very important that you know what that

366
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,289
device ask your network we go back to
our education example if you're giving

367
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:56,779
students tablet devices very important
that you know what they do and they take

368
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:00,470
that device home so what we're seeing it
in a lot of the endpoint protection

369
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:06,240
solutions is the ability to enforce the
same policy that they would have it they

370
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,740
were sitting on your network so content
filtering antivirus deep packet

371
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,840
inspection even application control
better yet provide the reporting of what

372
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,959
they did with them so did they try to go
to sites that were block it they pick up

373
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,679
wires pick up threats that were blocked
what's going on with them machine

374
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,799
condensing that into a report that shows
them right along with your connected

375
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,570
users so now you've got full disability
everybody that connected to the network

376
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:42,320
either be at switched Ethernet port
wireless or now even when they're off

377
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,509
network so this is kind of the next big
frontier of where we see your point

378
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,740
compliance it's not just making sure
that when it connects to your network

379
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,110
its compliance but making sure that when
that device goes off your network

380
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,629
you've got the visibility you got the
reporting you got the audit trail and

381
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:03,519
you've got the peace of mind in knowing
that that devices being used for the

382
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,779
purposes you considered going to take it
to the next level and we got a familiar

383
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,049
with Sandboxie kurdistan boxing know
what it does the box was designed to

384
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:21,809
take unknown files unknown malware
antivirus send it to a box that will run

385
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:27,418
that program to load up in a virtual
image see what that filed then and then

386
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,179
deemed unsafe or even as a threat we're
seeing a lot more of the endpoint

387
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,020
protection solutions be able to do this
right from the imp

388
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,190
so I'm on a website I downloaded an
unknown style never been seen before by

389
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,220
my antivirus Nike reputation doesn't
know what it is to your fencing doesn't

390
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,240
know what it is automatically send the
file to a sandbox either and microsites

391
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,160
or somewhere in the crowd that file is
safe before I get leverage that open it

392
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,700
take advantage of that so we start to
see a lot of interest in doing that

393
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,900
specific government agencies were again
they need that audit trail of what was

394
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,920
downloaded what was it was a safe or was
it malicious so what kind of role this

395
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,250
you know what we see is a lot of
different areas of the network where we

396
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,150
can take a lot of advantage of providing
enhanced security services there's a lot

397
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,560
to think about what am i doing for my
course firewall what am i doing for UTM

398
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,879
services or do I need internal
segmentation firewalls in my environment

399
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,260
what are they doing all my wired and
wireless what am i doing for

400
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,970
authentication am i doing in point
compliance and do I have a solution to

401
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:45,160
do in point integrity and Endpoint
Protection and when we rolled us all up

402
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,260
it will fit into a very nice frame word
gives the customer for you guys

403
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,580
something planner and figure out where
the gaps are where the security holes

404
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,399
were in my folder so that you're not
getting cock on the back end up being

405
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,990
the securities for a breach big titted
they're protected by implementing

406
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,389
something along this path within the
solution

407
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,079
very high degree of interest in a
framework it's not a single point

408
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,510
product it's not one solution that saves
your network it's really having all the

409
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,389
controls in policy in place all on the
network to make sure that you're not

410
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,950
vulnerable to attack so I'm gonna stop
there

411
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,529
that's what I got for you guys I'd be
happy to take any questions or speak to

412
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:35,559
any of the element in a security
framework alternate over to you guys

413
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:49,679
any questions I can answer for you guys
have any questions you want to pick up

414
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,539
the the design guide for a security
framework be happy to share that with

415
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:56,269
you can expect that thanks for let me
come and present you guys today
