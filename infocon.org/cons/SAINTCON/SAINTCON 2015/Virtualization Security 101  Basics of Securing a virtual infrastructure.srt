1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:14,199
26 this year have been stopped in the
last four years so I'm going to find

2
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,700
some services this morning how many your
virtualization admins and that's all you

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,430
do I commend your friends how are you
are security people who have to do with

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,550
your thesis that many people who run the
virtualization piracy ok just do

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,909
everything to you the only major shock
over this will be a good introduction

6
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:43,710
take everything you learned the rest of
the week in the regulation off its new

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,539
this is a 101 courses will be fairly
basic not gonna die diva on specific

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,179
things because it's a one-on-one don't
wanna hear you too much for you too much

9
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,909
information so so you've learned this
week

10
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:04,440
security in general is more of a science
and an art sometimes art applies to most

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,009
famous science

12
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,920
you think having that didn't make it
passes through tests verify that we got

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,200
there is also expected in boxes again
did if process

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,899
they are per year arenas barbara was
speaking to an audience this is going to

15
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:36,250
be like a tinder boxes do their job too
young and very melodic about this but

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,420
science it's science

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,219
looking at the hard facts that should be
this way we're talking about part of

18
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:47,788
bacteria and it can we talk about the
day before school starts with the start

19
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:52,539
of actually doing security guard
advertises security operation of the

20
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:57,209
things you should do in your environment
regardless of its virtual numbers across

21
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:05,360
the board but needs to be specific when
segmentation

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,099
your network don't put your vCenter
Server Management Server on the same

23
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,690
network as the web server that sits next
to it that is hosting its managing

24
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,359
director web server now that you mention
it did across really easy to say

25
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,300
goodnight networks just a little bit

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,670
all your virtual host your virtual
management shall be completely isolated

27
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,390
should not have publicly accessible
connectivity can connect to get updates

28
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,640
and stuff but not connect directly in
from the outside your window system you

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,559
compromise over to your management if
you're running be sent out windows but

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,550
after that it'll come out of the news

31
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:01,920
planes i mean is a little bit better for
research so we got the happy family

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,660
everybody on one side and the
segmentation there are reports that as a

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,900
means of payment too much second
configuration management everybody's

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:19,410
running but Jeff sensible the Etsy for
Microsoft Microsoft 510 much stuff most

35
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,710
of us like it looks like the first
pictures are on the on the left second

36
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,440
papers written a few things must be done
here gonna get compromise should be what

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,950
it looks like I don't know pick it up

38
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,410
but you shouldn't look at moving to one
of these manager tools public Jeff for

39
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,510
example doesn't like a filing system the
back of your configs knows what you're

40
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,310
looking at

41
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,819
can tell you when they changed the
system changes convicted a you know why

42
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,140
do you have a way to go start
investigating what might have changed

43
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,549
and they're making changes

44
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,750
ok you have a reason why he's making
changes if you wanna meet center and you

45
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,150
have a better price fluctuations article
think all those profiles to get setup

46
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,489
but fairly certain you take those who
have running back for the hosts file

47
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,810
format and then you can tell all your
other posts apply the same for a while

48
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,988
you have a basic config you can actually
go in and look at the profile and easier

49
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,219
for you to look at and with that setup
as you make it you just need to make

50
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,139
them but it really can do find what the
house looks like it's cool enough to

51
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,600
move out of the plane from vSphere it
requires every day goes boots and

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,110
reconfigure the system based on that for
a while but it's really good planning

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,969
system so kind of configuration

54
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:50,199
Waverly every ready to take a break and
so the Microsoft managed to its kinda

55
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,349
knew it then powerful by the amount
orbit in five trillion billion by the

56
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:01,589
desired state configuration you see it's
gonna be really popular next year with

57
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:09,079
16 and hyper-v and now serving August
but it's cool to for the future

58
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:18,599
basic configuration and do some get
better at it at this number three

59
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:25,069
upon your blog steps or some other way
to put your life somewhere else besides

60
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:31,849
over there on gay couples 45 prime
something that a lot of free tools

61
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,479
there's a collective shoulder helps
thanks for that blk like the animal some

62
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:46,409
to be out doing it just sits log off the
box you can analyze it in the box boots

63
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,579
it was a tax and all those lights
disappeared because there are certain

64
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,030
memory special free sex

65
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,630
some routes you could have alerted some
of these tools are they see things

66
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,520
happen

67
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,440
hey I just got four thousand login
request that could be a problem on a

68
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,450
regular day that would you like to
request coming though you can set up

69
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:13,520
some monitoring on the dogs that are off
that box and also centralizing if their

70
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,109
own choices easier to monitor do you
look at that repository of data that not

71
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:25,460
all of these images economy lost my life
is like a box somewhere off the post

72
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,090
anything with him he that doeth hosted
by now hosts problem I have no way there

73
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:40,570
correlating that data to me ago
ballwig's just dumping them at a memory

74
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,180
when it reboots and so you miss
everything but in a larger even than

75
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,450
slice and dice it however you want even
the mark scott gets definitely use

76
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,770
passing through here like the crash
occurred sets talk on Monday about

77
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,479
patching excellent talk to our patching
looking like the demolition derby here

78
00:07:05,480 --> 00:08:04,139
hazardous business gets a six-hour get
that big Thrasher anything that

79
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,800
tracks

80
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,789
text that should be a patching process
again methodical documented known you

81
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:15,250
can see those matches you know where
your ad again along issue if you block

82
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,520
the longest said he was passing today
knowing that patches of white you can

83
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,030
actually keep track of where things are
at so you don't think I can picture

84
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,289
problems I want to fix it with the
patches importantly ok lets the art of

85
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,000
their operational things you should be
doing in general not specific regulation

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:55,120
per se because all your eggs were told
they could part of the company and its

87
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,820
concern about the run test and verify
that you're getting your disaster zones

88
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,519
so we're going to a science on top of
our age so recent

89
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,670
VMware has been very good for several
years they had a guy very detail more

90
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,769
details

91
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:21,519
talk about the current a little bit but
its directions and guidance on how to

92
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,059
implement some of the security features
that are already there more than

93
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:33,469
anything there are doing and is not to
give you specific about what to do but

94
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,739
as a tool to generate discussion of the
security team of how should we do this

95
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:44,319
where should we look at what can I offer
you from the feature cybersecurity and

96
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:51,589
can do that we need to look like and yes
and sign up to test it there's also as a

97
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,399
feature six there's a VCR security guys
a lot of the stuff that was in previous

98
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,449
guys actually now the security level
guidance about the options you can

99
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:05,849
choose from and why you choose one
they're spelled out said PDF rather than

100
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:16,279
the nynex LCD TV check out now go
download it could have been three or so

101
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,209
doing to it it's a free tool around the
PowerShell it will check every morning

102
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:28,160
as often as you want any email you could
satisfy your systems go through like

103
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,399
four hundred different checks underneath
your environment I think there might be

104
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,670
one reason you have to go check the
website look that big inside information

105
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,889
gathering comes here email you can look
for real quick you can choose which

106
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,699
plugins you want to run and then verify
which brings settings you wanna keep

107
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,040
track of time I know when I wouldn't
mind it actually point that hey you've

108
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,089
got these shots shots in your
environment

109
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,089
k quite a few

110
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:05,209
how long should you keep your stamps no
more than a couple days really sure that

111
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:11,550
we get bogged down in the future I got
some snapshots pro career had one that

112
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,189
actually crashed my storage because when
it was brand new install snapshot it

113
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:23,099
they've been added to terabytes of data
to the p.m. doing that snapshot emerged

114
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,559
that sent back into the base storage to
the doesn't destroy when it's working

115
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,889
with back in the day so i didnt have
four terabytes available on the disc was

116
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:41,709
sitting on my side of the day storm I
was ok but that will tell you how long

117
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:47,899
to get you so you know if you are too
long you need to go look at it again the

118
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,900
email reporting in your email

119
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,030
listen here for four days to call up and
say hey Bob will have another chance not

120
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:03,319
going to read it on over so checking ok
next week make sure we're done at an

121
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,920
easy way to keep track to tell you about
that

122
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,390
levels of talk about it there's like
partners and employees from all

123
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,390
customizable to what you need for your
ground so little deeper in the morning

124
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,900
i'd get a chance to be in the hold up I
have it on my laptop here

125
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,770
backslide had a picture of it get a flat
flattening space in previous versions

126
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,980
that were separate tabs in the
spreadsheet was really good read now

127
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,360
they're all of the poor music's I you
know what product to deal with and what

128
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,430
to bring attention to be here tells you
what is adding that gonna fly to give a

129
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,520
brief description of the risks of
modifying changing the setting that most

130
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,930
of the most of this bridge

131
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:54,660
talking like a really bright white table
in the parish of script amor I'm still

132
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,230
commands to go many genes that setting
this is very usefull how would you said

133
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:09,310
this on 15 2010 6:10 and we also don't
do it on way and severally again we're

134
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,199
going to configuration manager here we
started different way that we know it's

135
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,460
also the same

136
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:24,080
get methods to go ask various textos hey
what's your setting for this report on

137
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,040
that and say these are all the same this
one different you know which way to go

138
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:39,439
look at how it's ok looks like they did
a nice job offering some colors here

139
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,910
again he is excited and EP risk profile
level depending on your tolerance for

140
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:56,780
risk level 3 risk profile your we're
talking about the FBI has $0.00 in all

141
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,579
categories

142
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,380
121 is I'm a little worried but not
paranoid yet I'm judaism somebody's

143
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:10,060
gotta sit here to tell you the
definition there and that lengthy

144
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:16,189
explanation of what the settings again
further cost sheet there are the other

145
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,420
details on these three things that the
one in the middle there in the white

146
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,569
cells

147
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:33,490
you can tell which have to go tell her
to write them by default pic scratch

148
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,850
based on reboot a devotee network
settings

149
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:52,579
so we aren't saving the operational side
this is here to guide now talk a lot

150
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:56,449
about security hardening chosen for the
network where the talks about the

151
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:00,540
segmentation your network noticing
things were to put things certificates

152
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,209
that are on the hosts that are on
different components from single sign-on

153
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:10,160
had a hardon thats how to build out user
roles who uses roles in their

154
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:19,719
environment and research center in my
career working on use more roles but you

155
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,509
can find more than one rolls or group
can be assigned to more than one roll a

156
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:28,000
lot of things that role based in vSphere
to all designed to be roadways a bug me

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,339
all the time he I can do this operation
I gotta figure out what operation is

158
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:37,759
there to do more that they actually need
to add that to give them access easy way

159
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,089
to segment who can do what we're dealing
with Rose you're making permission

160
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,199
assignments on the themes and templates
you in the folders they're not imposing

161
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,310
coasters

162
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,430
killing 11 people that we should be
touching my house is probably me and my

163
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,229
father said networks and regulation I
don't need everybody much you're out my

164
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,160
servers making change this morning at
the select few but I do have lots of

165
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,110
people have their own GM's management
there so in this is mark the art

166
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:14,410
operational guidance on how to do things
and be here to talk about other things

167
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,120
it doesn't mention before migrations in
the last day you actually call you in

168
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,620
which the emotion and that's an
interesting report to look at and say

169
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,890
why is it taking 40 minutes to move this
p.m. between two nodes services to look

170
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,920
at the past year plans for capacity no
easy way to the days are small and then

171
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,469
panic when you buy another stand or buy
more days never could get to estimate

172
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,990
how much RAM CPU time you have left you
bill

173
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,610
I'm against version

174
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,070
it was the only part I don't like about
the report is a telephone call might be

175
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,750
out of date the environment and three
hundred and fifty of them are not really

176
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:15,790
used to date on top of the morning that
research about worked along the console

177
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,720
to see what had happened was that he
went up in 1852 and then some storage

178
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,100
stuff if you just get a slight of hand
said the check it kind of looks like you

179
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,320
don't mind games don't anybody you know
sometimes getting into my environment

180
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,000
and then converting under the system do
they know they are now in a little box

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,110
their medium ballooning tomorrow
balloons in memory way for me to tell

182
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,580
you which ones are being affected by how
much

183
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:59,399
says Williams has less than one gig of
ram assigned maybe don't care maybe do

184
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,900
chairman you wanna go she's like to give
them the more than to give this time

185
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,570
depending on your reports that was
actually nvm are great space coaster

186
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,770
tells me there's thirteen tell me how
much space is free I don't have to go

187
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,270
into every game and see that there are
other space heater to grow the hard

188
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:30,180
drive before when does your grandma does
face some interesting things like that

189
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:40,780
he questions of higher operational
science of the artsy stuff in their case

190
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,379
so I just want to be enrolled in
September for September is really

191
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,430
awesome I had a good time I did actually
go see the session person but I watched

192
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:55,730
everybody to me that really good here in
10 on what's your biggest fear the deer

193
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,280
were secure

194
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,879
what's your biggest fear

195
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:15,449
what's your biggest fear

196
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:43,039
really awesome guy their names were here
then if you want to go

197
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,330
reference the session so my my my
security team's biggest fear is the

198
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,189
signal yet somehow managed to break out
in the AM and that tax another system

199
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:01,059
protecting my razor other things like
that that is all directions there's a

200
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,639
lot of white papers are that's it can be
done in a proven that it can be done but

201
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:10,658
that's all based on fictional
hypothetical environments where you

202
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:17,600
control the control settings they ran to
ram through its not done on VMware

203
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,969
VirtualBox on top of windows they use
words about the Linux

204
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,990
if they do not have one hypervisor it's
a very old version with known

205
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,950
vulnerabilities that have been tasked in
newer versions on the virtualization

206
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,790
journeys in at least seven years we've
been doing virtualization if you're

207
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:47,200
stuck on yes X 40 or 41 the same upgrade
50 51 55 60 ton of changes a ton of

208
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,750
updated again we talk about this is
beginning dating I can help you

209
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,570
security comes with all those updates
are not as texts the other part of it is

210
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:08,030
improbable and very costly to execute in
a little bit more depth it was easy for

211
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,980
all of that and social media like we do
everything else political contest

212
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,500
everything else everybody we talked
about a lot I got out of this p.m. would

213
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,850
have a hacker challenge here it would be
easy does not easy because we don't care

214
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,179
about it hardly ever acceptance of these
doctor abuses in the world and spent two

215
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,029
years developing and publishing

216
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:34,139
so medications against attacks real life
cycle development is unreimbursed side

217
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,908
as they develop on the platform as a
whole

218
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,519
their components abbas says it's very
lengthy I didn't put it in the flight

219
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:49,909
deck but it's very development process
there's a lot of circular Bucs tix test

220
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:55,049
this doesn't work actually get down to
you a before tax to get published

221
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,800
to us then users within itself

222
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,030
there's isolation between the execution
of instructions and increase p.m. and

223
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,690
hypervisor so they all were inseparable
container rebels separation between the

224
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,340
memory there's no memory collusion there
each one is owned by a separate process

225
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,399
32 p.m. the member mental component the
networks action each p.m. get its own

226
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,750
network stack buttocks through the
colonel and validate the input and

227
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:35,960
output of the devices I'm USB drives
other other devices that are in there

228
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,240
the network devices those each running
their own bubble as well

229
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,280
p.m. so there's no real way to give
between p.m. is good there's there's no

230
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,510
communication mediums independent
comment on stories as well as its own

231
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,600
checks and balances that go through once
you go through if you do manage to

232
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,399
escape the p.m. causing it is possible
to demonstrate its possible on older

233
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:05,270
code type one code per text to your
workstation

234
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:11,730
VirtualBox to journey back to you some
other fun stuff we do those type take to

235
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:18,270
get you can break out and explain again
most windows which is fairly common you

236
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,639
do at that point if you do manage to
escape type 1 hypervisor there's no cell

237
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,940
bash bache interpreter no Linux commands
work because it's near your the

238
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:38,540
environment they're doing Piz call and
there's no you know i text you cross a

239
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,170
few instructions have you taken a
similar class not execute assembly

240
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:51,530
instructions on x86 platform miles ahead
I'll often do you do miles member so he

241
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,670
knows how he has another long time so
chances are that way there might be a

242
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,210
few people out there they did mention
the people that know how to get out of

243
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,280
the VN and executing instructions I
would actually run a check in the

244
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,750
hydrate yourself to make sure that this
process should be running this

245
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,690
instruction 6 for any random instruction
has to be something you're allowed to be

246
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,580
either works or VMware or they know
where they live

247
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:21,439
served on a very short list of people
that there there were two get very hard

248
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,830
when you get out there is nothing there
to give you a wake up to do anything you

249
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,750
can't inject yourself certain to go on
that network's down there okay so the

250
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:40,050
facts are facts in here to talk about
this is back to where we started

251
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:46,600
operational security here how do you how
do you operate in your environment my

252
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:52,500
credentials getting X ray more
vulnerable in my ESX server going to be

253
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,890
amusing escape yes you can compromise
them into the West running in that name

254
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:03,130
once you get into the harbor waiver of
nvm again your contracts to my kids are

255
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,600
really easy to get to a person I make
mistakes like social engineering to

256
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,620
finance NBC R

257
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,969
either way there's lots of ways to get
my car engines

258
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,830
back your rolls conversation with these
villages not widely implemented by

259
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,559
implementing my world trade not even I
have to walk into a separate special

260
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,360
account of the Super Admin ago due on
Sept

261
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,620
very limited to do what I need to do is
add a 2d version of any delay in doing

262
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:41,949
its segments of my accounts their common
passwords every host to have my moment

263
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,260
permeability warning don't technically
the password to the through these

264
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,408
demands that way should they have only
one word bastard nobody chose to have

265
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:56,030
its own adventure movies way to manage
that right now and cheese then on a

266
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:02,860
regular one hypervisor you probably
going to raise funds usually enough to

267
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:09,110
get you where you want to go again
compromise the admin to get access to

268
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,740
the rescue for structured you compromise
my account you not only on my piece here

269
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,299
but you are about to be in the room on
top of the research

270
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:20,499
access to other things get in the domain
controller made a reliever hypervisors

271
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,649
you got everything on top of it never is
just gonna they're giving research

272
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:34,090
communications you do to prevent to
adjust automations to limit the admins

273
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:40,080
access other users access to new york's
voter little bit automation is great if

274
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,739
you're not familiar there's a jew
companies here or should it comes to

275
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:47,139
these fears free kind of building the
package has been for several generations

276
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:53,269
very JavaScript heavy but hopefully you
can learn a little bit of Remington

277
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:59,330
forgiving JavaScript enabled the game in
the third their discussion VMworld

278
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:05,999
premiums daily on a daily basis for
somebody I got maybe three or four week

279
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:10,179
most weeks

280
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:16,160
on there are some daily tasks

281
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,890
to do that when they've been given that
script execution inside of these jurors

282
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,430
later specific villages throughout
Greater text you this very diverse and

283
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,220
doing it doesn't have any religion all
users notify the web site and says the

284
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,870
scripts and executed by other means you
can live it kind of some of your

285
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,290
exposure to other other bad things
myself if I ever they changed the script

286
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,980
is easily to do this bad things again

287
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:56,260
patch testing the new medications I know
a few years ago there was a couple of

288
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,450
news feeds about some of the VMware
hypervisor code getting suppose to be

289
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,860
got it together they would get the
source code

290
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,939
that's great for that was the virgins
ago none of that code is actually still

291
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,920
use it if it is it's been pardoned and
reviewed several times incentive to move

292
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,570
forward another question

293
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:27,159
pick you up in that discussion we can
issue though they might mention that he

294
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:34,340
had a survey asked the question so how
much of my memory management now there

295
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,770
other other parts of those that we broke
out on the VMA other isolated in the

296
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:44,950
past those are all done in somewhere in
this week has suffered more normal human

297
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,929
rights met somewhere in the test it was
done in software since then

298
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,570
intel has added instructions to the
tribute to offload some of that some

299
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:02,559
person ever in order to enhance security
becomes really really easy that they're

300
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,629
also working on a personal ppm chip so
you can validate your VMs running inside

301
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,840
and then they move around its doors that
open

302
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,289
is the game moves between host of
measures that seek to do

303
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:22,100
gestation and the vertical air as well
as the host later coming out at second

304
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:28,629
on patches and media releases secure
management interface of her voice was

305
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,100
back to item 1 segmentation I'm actually
looking one of the tasks you when I get

306
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,559
back to my office next week is able two
factor authentication might be severe

307
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,870
and since then have a proxy server that
I said is that you got rough indication

308
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,668
in my LDAP from my research service
gonna get better

309
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:51,460
you won't know you're going to factor
until massive on your phone says hey you

310
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,549
need to sign in again to this other
mechanisms 2008 your county directly

311
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:04,129
wanting to sign in to be sure to some
extra security at airport currently so

312
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,429
basically just talking about that
restriction the team escaped detection

313
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:14,070
again the move are there representing
costs and the green representing

314
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:22,168
probably very costly or time-consuming
go to do once you get out and again very

315
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:27,190
few very low probability yes it can be
done by mistake and the probability wise

316
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:34,000
if I change my mind me correctly if I
have segmented everything correctly if I

317
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,690
catch if I've got central locking and I
got settled in Costa decoration you're

318
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,659
never really hard time not letting me
know you've gotten that far

319
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,580
something's gotta change when you do
that on the flip side the operational

320
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,100
security problem which have you heard a
lot about this week might have heard is

321
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,309
very vulnerable takes next to nothing to
get into my pictures even an email right

322
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:02,168
now before we started telling me to turn
off my father discovered network win a

323
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:07,120
proxy configuration settings again
that's easier to sell my still my

324
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,229
credentials there to talk about some
good players will be spared this weekend

325
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,850
is mentioned on there are many ways to
my grandmas we had our security out in

326
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:23,149
the parking lot with third exercise
morning twenty express my own tried to

327
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:30,360
access their AP on my way into into the
office it's easy to walk in the library

328
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,770
in the parking lot walking the office
they have my credentials let them take

329
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:39,149
anybody anything to do that personally
I've since moved just the same account

330
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,419
that is not the case in my funding to
the white flight

331
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,090
to have separate account for my
administration but that's much easier to

332
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,330
compromise get into and once again those
principles not only did it might be

333
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:58,760
easier to get my 82 mean what other
servers that not important part you can

334
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,560
do it all over the place so I spoke with
any other questions

335
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:19,770
security yes the SSH disabled unless
you're planning on using it for

336
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,210
something in the past I had a visitation
able to my backup agent getting back in

337
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,650
town of censorship products as it is now
disabled that's an excellent thing you

338
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,440
can do it with the script is it safe to
say there's actually a warning by

339
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,870
default and video that shows a fire hose
says unable to get a script that ran

340
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,489
frequently

341
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,420
you know right away if it somehow got
turned on there's actually another city

342
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,720
investir to disable that warning signal
that the disabled morning and then turn

343
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,880
it on and he was getting boring but you
can still get weary from external script

344
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,610
and know that it was on down there so
when I get turned on my back of asian

345
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:06,340
guy who was on it was intentionally on
but now that I'm not using that I wanna

346
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:27,480
know but simply that attacker could
disable the morning and then turn it off

347
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:36,950
two factors so I'm not in the studio
with us at 1701 service we got in on a

348
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:45,750
deal I believe was last year with 20
through either I to or not was not sure

349
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,580
we got it really cheap at the time
apparently that deal since expired

350
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:56,179
they're not very deep licensed everybody
so in general for most the windows are

351
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:02,480
reversed with the dual agent on there
for RDP in the walk-in simpson be a

352
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,330
Windows authentication scheme that works
for most things we do to phone calls

353
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,540
we've got money tokens for that almost
as much as I have the app on my phone

354
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:17,219
and it brings the app when I walk in I
personally have I believe 45 potentials

355
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,879
in there so many of my accounts try to
get walked in I have to cut my finger

356
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,609
where prove it and by means of my phone

357
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:32,918
open the app and type in code
syndicators so that's a Mercedes so far

358
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:38,049
moving towards some things using a proxy
server the does to back on the back end

359
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:43,788
so it's an LDAP Aradia service if the
proxy user doesn't know they're going to

360
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:48,210
factor driving as the reader like a box
for the application of the criminals

361
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,859
over

362
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:53,768
indicate a DS you can have indicated ed
it won't do that you better be so you

363
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:57,598
have to get your password to the strike
and it'll pass the two factors for the

364
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,640
two vector secondary education i'm ok I
talked with my another one of my Edmonds

365
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,910
I work with are looking at moving some
of that sounds easier 67 integration or

366
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:16,890
so that the samples Dec to manage when
I'm liking this app I need to factor in

367
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:21,750
then if I haven't already done to better
recently it'll filmmaker calling and dad

368
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,510
from but again there are you a chance
where that's coming down the street a

369
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,980
couple years that's already on shiftless
would be the same way back into the

370
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,750
negation piece together a sequester that
the answer question miles any other

371
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,320
commercial basic security question or
grad students began stuff as a guy was

372
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,770
gonna have to play the beginning here is
that if I am I'm whatever works for you

373
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:52,880
you have been doing work stuff for eight
years now start with person to 25 back

374
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:04,920
in the dark ages of fertilization can
come up through there was a different

375
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,260
apartment that it was kind of a science
credit rested given a few features

376
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:17,990
so we had to move to their server 2005
Microsoft's and that one was it again

377
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,049
that's over there actually filling out
some remote sites with a single virtual

378
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,440
host does it was a small patching
problem has to match those takeover in

379
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,900
town that's why was it bad to coast and
they don't have a redundancy

380
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,830
cluster failover it is the only host
those scenarios it's just dumb settle

381
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,880
down time sorry tonight

382
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,940
Thanksgiving down for 20 minutes wife
had my house to get up-to-date nothing

383
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:55,340
changed me overcome with some scheduling
sued reference for those under your feet

384
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:02,750
read the texts so there is actually a
cool thing I get emails all the time

385
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,279
they're slightly annoying because I care
about sturdy little bit I wanna get them

386
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:12,279
there's a financial security advisory
every time they had something for their

387
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:16,759
demeanor believes they've become aware
of as they are usually campaign with

388
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:27,369
TV's most of the recent 17 Jabu Jabu sex
updated using 1971 @ 6:01 OpenSSL and

389
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:31,199
hurt lead in Google and all that came
out there were several security advisers

390
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,140
on those things and they tell you what
product versions are vulnerable like

391
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:41,109
peter has like five versions on their
kid what you need to upgrade to text to

392
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:51,739
read actually security hardening guide
HTML on there it's a great little email

393
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:56,369
at just come out maybe twice a week and
what's going on in other developing they

394
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,749
said you multiple copies of the same one
as things get updated if you wear this

395
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:05,439
is one bility and then the next email
comment will say this vulnerability and

396
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:10,209
patch update to this version of this
bill number and you can check with

397
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:13,499
automated hopefully my semiannual

398
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,660
pretty consistent subject one host and
no environment

399
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:23,140
but were cement would never need to be
at 9:01 accept money my update when I

400
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,920
get a few sigmund incorrectly if they're
isolated from the internet now there's a

401
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,010
website out there I don't know the link
to the URL you can actually there's

402
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,280
thousands of ESX servers

403
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,510
directly connect to the internet you can
be treated like that happens but

404
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,500
something in front of them sigmund them
they should never have you should never

405
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,270
be a black this your ESX those from the
network going back to the most part yes

406
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,780
that never needed on the internet that
shopping center

407
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,250
window the patches meter 6 clients
actually have a way for itself sorry

408
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:04,630
John download the patch destroy itself
so maybe it means of internet access but

409
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,819
there are other ways of delivering a big
swell that require new internet is for

410
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,680
those joining the internet internet the
different story yes you should do it

411
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,770
then

412
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:41,460
to please enter 64 for different
environments

413
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:55,390
so some of us are still very early cuz
Windows has been pretty consistent cash

414
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:02,430
these days have gone so you're on the
site and a fetching

415
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:07,520
has been somewhat regularly as well as
those on the same page to come out for

416
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,720
the Windows version commemorative
lansford and they're not quite as

417
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,169
there's maybe 276 chipped in March

418
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:31,059
updates for the appliance parts plants
vs build your own plans correctly which

419
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:35,569
I believe Mr has stripped out all the
parts they're not using its dedicated to

420
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:38,980
what it needs to do it hasn't just those
tools kinda like the hypervisor

421
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:47,700
catching to do if anybody remember the
good old days never use X 14 2011

422
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,618
actually deployed when you get the patch
update list it was like 30 or 40 or 50

423
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:58,380
patches every time because they're
catching Linux and the XML and at this

424
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,250
stage in OpenSSL never this whole stack
of stuff since ESXi you go to the list

425
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:09,050
there's like maybe two or three one of
them to be more tools package one of

426
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:15,090
them is based configuration for ESXi the
base code includes the hypervisor all of

427
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,980
its components in the

428
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:23,140
different types there and that's it
difficult the third one is really maybe

429
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,549
the network driver something from those
are using the three updates to come out

430
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,600
and that's it that's all there is a
point to the same way they used to come

431
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,670
in a bundle if you're downloading
yourself to stop of the bundle in it as

432
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,359
whatever time to bash the vCenter plans
does have a few more things running

433
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:45,770
because it drives what services it
actually has a patchy of actually

434
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,850
connects there are other components in
there that needs to do its web at the

435
00:41:49,850 --> 00:42:10,880
spirit store stuff like that

436
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:30,589
so you go to the appliance windows login
the Viet see it once windows but it's

437
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,920
happy to live on a different host then
yes senator itself in as a toboggan

438
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,539
negative boxes boxes in and ninety
percent of my environments

439
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:45,440
visitor that's appliance and I've
actually broke out the SSO certificate

440
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,410
store please answer is controlled by
mid-summer young so I still have to the

441
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:57,788
M's by 1:30 p.m. it runs Windows Update
Manager to install my updates I believe

442
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:02,970
it's going to take some time to keep
waving their hands some time of dinner

443
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:09,209
will be somehow immigrated into Windows
8 p.m. anyway so there is a location you

444
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,539
can put some of those export rules on
that is Windows anyway and still related

445
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:16,720
to be there so it's a totally closed
rules again the report is visitors now

446
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,819
appliance its limited it's got its scope
is exactly does exactly what it should

447
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:26,640
do other ancillary p.m. that I can
repeat as needed to designate patches

448
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,460
that's not the right one interception
and it's all the accessories

449
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:40,680
the media they need other tools are not
associate with the core network

450
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,740
well it really want to reboot network
server the days off then only if the

451
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,000
subset of servers any other
virtualization questions

452
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:00,510
45 minutes at least

453
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:23,210
so that they do have generators

454
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:41,470
so when I remember is that it was NSX
NSX it mentions it does matter

455
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,569
segmentation the network where are you
going to be easy to talk to each other

456
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:52,609
and talked into this p.m. in that span
all there is at the firewall proposed

457
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:57,440
and what to do about the firewall on the
security side is there a catch 22 p.m.

458
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,440
so wherever the VMA goes that far while
polls he traveled with its not at the

459
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,450
borders on an essay done in a digital
devices trombone go out and come back to

460
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:13,848
actually do its job at the expense of
soon because doctor in the other

461
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:18,070
computer systems running natively on
VMware

462
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:23,490
into that is another piece of paper in
there they are born into this network

463
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,879
can do these things

464
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,349
maybe have some expression exactly but
Sen gonna be big fish in the basement

465
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:37,819
ever gets here we need to start looking
and doing in in implementing this does

466
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:45,829
things against segregation was never too
early to segment all sorts of things I

467
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:46,660
don't have one

468
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,828
I V space with everything on the network
east west able to collaborate connected

469
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:59,759
now down to just do things the right way

470
00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:06,200
container wave yet lightweight confused
one of the container for the doctor

471
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,000
stuff but it's not an actual another tip
the product which is on top of research

472
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,060
something that works after that

473
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,330
and thought I might have to put it in
there to not let them talk to each other

474
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,049
as well

475
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:24,390
gonna be more security home page the
link to be checking their you don't need

476
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,600
to do anything else go down the street
to get even if you're running hyper-v

477
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,990
could elevate your security guy
something worthwhile but they give you

478
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:38,720
operation of things to the segmentation
traffic network security record

479
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,609
management node shells toward
configurations on his stuff and

480
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,280
restructured if you're interested if you
want to be emerald or have a man

481
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:56,810
advantage thing you can go look at these
talks back versus fiction is the

482
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:03,140
leaving the VMAs options we should and
we should stick to the other one kind of

483
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:11,379
the operational and deception any other
questions

484
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,680
tired of a long week of having them I
know I am actually midnight every night

485
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:31,339
train had some questions to me one of
its be happy to answer the questions on

486
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,350
the side of the time the Treasury gonna
have to rely on me just didn't know

487
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,509
better
