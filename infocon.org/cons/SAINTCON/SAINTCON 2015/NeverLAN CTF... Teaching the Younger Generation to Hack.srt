1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:17,560
everyone my name is Taylor purpose and
for those who don't know I was here last

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,619
year designing with Saudi exists Akon
and back again brought a few friends at

3
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,599
me but the first year was here

4
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,190
teaching the younger generation to hack
and we're talking about how to get

5
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,709
involved in this year we're going back
to teaching the younger generation half

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,610
but we're doing it a little differently
we're approaching a little differently

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,329
in different crowd which looks like
later so who are we

8
00:00:49,329 --> 00:01:03,440
this picture to school he is one of the
co-creators of the school since three

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,080
years ago and is very conference we were
sitting in our teachers room and we

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,960
decided that we wanted to make a
hackerspace jumped on that project

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:24,089
we're still working on it in their
countries we have like a 3d printer we

12
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:41,600
have we have we have a couch until we
have tables in their computers TVs whole

13
00:01:41,600 --> 00:02:05,179
bunch of tools like you saw doing
something so this is Tanner purvis he's

14
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:11,950
our project we generate is an avid
golfer you love cigars and he's been on

15
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:20,929
our team for three years of high school
when he is programming and programming

16
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,130
is most likely sleeping managed to
maintain a very high grade point average

17
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,620
in all of our schools pretty impressive
ted has an extensive knowledge in HTML

18
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,010
JavaScript PHP Java Python and a whole
bunch of other programming languages

19
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,730
and one internet is part of us let's do
students I gotta go down to the Google

20
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:58,328
campus give a brief presentation to all
the Google developer troops massive

21
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:09,629
project is a very avid programmer almost
more than me sometimes and Zane is he's

22
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,290
really the harbor school if there's
something that I need to know anyone

23
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,879
else needs to know

24
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:23,700
hardware for that matter of concern
about sane he was here last year saying

25
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,530
on and she was actually the first person
to get his badge assembled and working

26
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,299
so you get all the other professionals
and getting his only that he was the

27
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,629
first person to complete the first two
challenges the bad and the only reason

28
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,470
this evening complete the third mr
Thomson down here

29
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,510
teacher told us we need to head back to
the hotel and unfortunately we did not

30
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,390
very sorry we share with us so we couldn

31
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,750
needed to put the challenge is very
impressive guys very smart very

32
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:10,440
ambitious and he's a great team and also
lives at our school he is there all the

33
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,540
time I don't see him leave I don't even
know a few parts of the school because

34
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,548
he doesn't have to have early if it's
time to go anywhere just get sick from

35
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,099
school

36
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,150
caesar's delivery but then has extensive
knowledge in HTML CSS JavaScript most

37
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,250
other languages he is really experience
has been in the programs and sophomore

38
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:51,890
years since the program suggesting that
way

39
00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:28,940
dresses with sleeves so it's basically a
five in the morning

40
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:58,659
that's his team down he's the service is
degraded by fighter which is one of the

41
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:07,730
hackerspace projects have available to
us working together is very dedicated

42
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:17,290
student and a lot of knowledge of
anything lemme Beach be so let's analyse

43
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:25,090
we have made in Jensen and she is our
local robotics masur she's won two world

44
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,940
championships and robotics she's the
co-creator of the neverland hackers face

45
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,580
a funny story about that is that when we
were pursuing that she went in and tore

46
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:43,500
down almost the same groups because they
used to be a video or audio recording

47
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,480
class

48
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:52,860
and it's very very expensive before
getting permission but that's made in

49
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:01,100
these decades soon she has a lot of
places a lot of work and she has

50
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:12,900
knowledge in HTML CSS and JavaScript
third his presentation teaching the

51
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:24,830
younger generation is want to introduce
education as middle school is all we had

52
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,849
really was a keyboarding class and you
want to give them more things to learn

53
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,150
they're still in middle school when
she's been critical thinking when

54
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:41,140
teaching the joy of learning and
basically reasoning skills just had a

55
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,400
computer really

56
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:56,630
how we doing this we're gonna be 80
creating a fun and attentive competition

57
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:15,990
that we like to call neverland CTS so
what is it but the capital event is

58
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:24,270
exactly the same here so it's not the
same jeopardy so bored or game or just

59
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:33,520
workin challenges gain points and then
points or is the winner but we've

60
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:45,560
changed up a little bit and we've done
we've lowered the difficulty will pick

61
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,400
up on but still they can learn something
and it's gonna be fun for them it's a

62
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,240
new way to get them involved and don't
worry yes everyone can compete so you

63
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,520
guys can compete

64
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:20,870
so like I said earlier and read
something on the internet

65
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:32,950
answer and the points really add a
competitive aspect of that and make some

66
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,490
really intriguing teaches us the entire
problem solve and think about things in

67
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,120
different ways I know programmers
differently than average student would

68
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,890
so teachers and to think like a
programmer and it makes of used the best

69
00:09:48,890 --> 00:10:02,080
resources they have which is the
internet so it also it's very fun

70
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,120
so someone smarter than any of us said
this while ago and basically he was

71
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,190
talking about

72
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,330
captured like events are important
because a lot of times we don't really

73
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,820
teach our students much more than they
don't learn the security side of things

74
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,160
and capture the flag events helped teach
them those things if they need to know

75
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,100
in order to be able to protect what they
make that way they don't they don't make

76
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,580
a program and then have a good exploit
ruined and other waste

77
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:48,080
you're probably wondering right now if
you are in street when is this gonna

78
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:56,070
happen next year it's gonna be taking
place February 26 2009 dance here's a

79
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,580
link to our website and Twitter see you
can follow that get updates on it but we

80
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,650
saw a lot of work to do but you can plan
for that next year and look forward to

81
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:17,630
that the game world is when we took the
see-saw they have it on there it's just

82
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:24,439
kind of a cell line it's just a good
starting point for us so we can build on

83
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,620
the actual power in a holding up its
gonna cum laude rebuilt canada's youth

84
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,170
that stayed up to how many doctors are
so serious challenges we just gotta go

85
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:52,160
on our own for this reason an Amazon Web
Server 2000 cities which have been used

86
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:02,319
by case basis to talk to the slave have
idea the doctors put me in the doctors

87
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,240
are focusing on because they're like
Linux kind of thoughts that we can just

88
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,520
set up programs for this one challenge
and we can discuss and

89
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:22,970
like virtual that we need and the
marathon can use a back seat to like it

90
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,930
needs to grow and shrink that has been
made so much money without having to

91
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:38,130
worry about like not having a hardware
to host a little neighborhood on a very

92
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:46,370
dynamic systems used so if we need more
people but these trusses much more kind

93
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:57,620
of compensation that many tax
collections so wondering how we got

94
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:06,040
started with this and disregard last
year saying on US 40 percent of your we

95
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,640
were at Sengkang last year and we had a
lot of fun with the hackers challenge

96
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,410
and so on the way back

97
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,630
same was thinking about how it would be
pretty fun to make one of our own and

98
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,900
you extend that to the middle school
level because my Crescent earlier we

99
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,939
didn't really have a lot of
opportunities in middle school we only

100
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,730
got a keyboarding class and that was the
extent of our computer science education

101
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,880
so we wanted to make something they
could get those opportunities out to

102
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,560
them before was you know too little too
late and so then came up with this idea

103
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,319
and he told us about it and we kinda had
jumped in there and now it's our senior

104
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,329
project which at our school the big
project that has to be later career

105
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:58,500
academics or the community's somehow it
has feelings too and if you don't do it

106
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,300
you don't graduate so for me personally
what inspired me was last year remember

107
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,019
I would say I stayed up too late to
three days in a row two or three in the

108
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:16,990
morning with dan Lavin what's your story
and I was the first day or two I was

109
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,199
really really struggling with a lot of
the challenges cuz I was so kind of you

110
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,760
to the program I didn't really know too
much about it and I was there I was just

111
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,060
telling them with question after
question after question China figure out

112
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,529
challenges and eventually I got through
it and I came out in 18th overall in

113
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:42,819
everyone there and I think I can tell
them they were very helpful and that's

114
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:47,500
what inspired me to do this because I
had a lot of fun I learned a lot and i

115
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,960
wanna

116
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:57,480
except those who are the opportunities
other people for me so I got started

117
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,190
that seemed calm at Sears and the thing
that really inspired me was dan came to

118
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,250
me last year and she texted Iranian I
after school one day and he had been

119
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:18,600
scattered storms in the week before
we're teaching alright anyway so

120
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,850
damaging to our teacher Mr Thomson last
year and he's on that you wanted to do

121
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,800
it another presentation that same car
and she had no idea that he wanted to do

122
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,709
it and at that point Mr Gibson explained
it to me I had no clue what I think on

123
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,440
even was and I had to go do some
research on it but after finding out

124
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,610
about it i mean it looked pretty cool I
didn't know what to expect but I was

125
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,900
totally ok with coming in speaking in
front of somebody boyden here tell me

126
00:15:50,900 --> 00:16:00,500
how many I see that there is a lot more
than I expected but so that for me I

127
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,980
mean that's what intrigued me was coming
in taking care of a bunch of people in I

128
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,360
was so nervous leading up to the whole
entire man I didn't know what to expect

129
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,700
and when he told me that there's gonna
be a bunch of security professionals

130
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:23,360
they're like oh I don't know how my own
with everyone else has actually been

131
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,720
professionals in the industry along and
21 actually got the same con-

132
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,689
and he was probably ten minutes before
we actually went up on stage at ten

133
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:41,019
o'clock holy crap there's a lot of
professionals out there are people

134
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,389
sitting out there and so I walked around
and kind of tune everyone out got into

135
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,649
the zone and give up here and I was
extremely nervous even when I got on

136
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,959
stage and after that after started
talking and kind of rolled out for me

137
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,518
and that's when I started realizing I
still since can actually hold their own

138
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,060
these professionals are not just these
kids who don't know anything in their

139
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,418
high school since they're not yet sure
enough to be here we can actually hold

140
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:13,100
their own after walking off the stage
that's kinda looked at me and helped the

141
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,339
same kind of help me what say yes we can
be read here with these people and

142
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,599
that's what inspired me to going they
capture the flag obscene I came up with

143
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:30,709
it I believe that the opportunity that I
did so I was able to come here and speak

144
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,429
in front of you guys and trying to hold
my own with the professionals they

145
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,370
should have the same opportunity just as
much as I did it come in here and do

146
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,479
these conferences and have just as much
fun as I did that for my inspiration

147
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,840
came from was saying calm and especially
liked him behave yourselves games that's

148
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:59,789
pretty much what we're doing CCF here
but yeah that's what inspired so for me

149
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:08,669
nevertheless these efforts to teach the
middle schoolers middle school I kind of

150
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:14,010
think I got the jump start like they can
get from this but what started me on the

151
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,370
track was last year we had these badges

152
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,270
a decider all up and everything that I
remember the first day we got here we

153
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,670
walked into the thing we have this bag
of tired and it's always that was a bad

154
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:32,350
that's awesome in so doing them first

155
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:41,639
retaining sat down the big room at the
back seat militant they're sort out

156
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,840
trying not to lose all parts of the
ground and everything let's do the same

157
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,309
time we went straight to the heart and
it certainly didn't get there without

158
00:18:53,309 --> 00:19:03,840
down station and we made sure that made
the bad guys doing so bad

159
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:12,050
led goes and that's where the two gether
but we didn t know like what size

160
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,090
anticipate we're which direction the
simple things you can you really know

161
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:30,790
how does this work we should use a
better this way are you gonna make you

162
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,070
look kinda cool word reading on a red
background just make the bicycle but

163
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:43,740
mainly over government was googling and
maybe half hour so try to figure out

164
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,450
what to do so he did you go to the
bathroom and we picture of the bags so

165
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,780
when we got back in the day we just kind
of you

166
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:02,500
up a bit and that kind of helped us so
we could see it together but rather day

167
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,230
like the day we had about his ability
and we're working on solving the

168
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,860
challenges I first got some chips in
this challenge and we're working on the

169
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,840
bad everyone professionals like how do
you do this and then looking overseas

170
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,220
soldiers we found out how to get the
databases and ended up being the first

171
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:32,110
person actually I think remaining what I
got from that was just that we can kind

172
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,830
of build these things and make her a
little device that most middle schoolers

173
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,110
don't even realize what's going into the
game you're playing all the programming

174
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,909
behind that everything that they're
doing on their cell phones all the

175
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,230
programs they have no clue how complex
at all is that you can see all the parts

176
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,680
and pieces in all the knowledge of the
code inside that it all comes together

177
00:20:51,680 --> 00:21:01,970
to make this school and middle school or
even a simple bags and say it's so cool

178
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:11,610
down and that's cool what time does the
other people and we need to do that with

179
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:29,010
the middle school program that I heard
about it that so that's cool site that

180
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,810
it plans

181
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,340
russia and you're gonna do it a little
earlier than a little head start on it

182
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,139
and I tell us where I'm coming from
wonder why I wanted to Neverland tedious

183
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:46,690
when I wear my sink on bads to school

184
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,340
definitely it's interesting that I know
that must the kids at school don't know

185
00:21:50,340 --> 00:22:01,470
what I get here they had led to those of
you aren't there any good program your

186
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:08,960
own lights and so the school and I have
my lights going they are asking you know

187
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,050
where did that come from that's so cool
and I told them to keep them safe and

188
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,000
then really not that was when I told
them that we all felt it ourselves and

189
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,360
programs ourselves so I mean it's fun to
share that it's really interesting

190
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,459
throughout the kids at school that we
can actually build these things in

191
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,830
program in the sink about what the stuff
that goes into what they're using each

192
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,110
and every day whether be their phone or
video game or whatever but it's

193
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:46,899
definitely interesting so how I got
started was three years ago I was a

194
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,150
sophomore and espn.com

195
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,500
yeah that sounds cool so we came as a
kind of us really knew I didn't know

196
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,730
what the hacker challenges were anything
and I got cracked cracking on some of

197
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,690
them and I got some of the points and
some of the security professionals over

198
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,030
there like so that I was struggling with
them and they're like come over here and

199
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,800
we'll help you and we went to a separate
room and they helped me do all the

200
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:21,470
challenges and I guess I wanted to give
that back I like reverse the tables so

201
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:36,650
I'm helping the kids younger than me do
the challenges and so I guess just so i

202
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,600
think im 13 years ago I'm democratic
social person and I started talking to

203
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,629
wean I was recording him as he was
giving us his shoulders and he didn't

204
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,910
know I was recording him and so I took
it back to challenges and help some

205
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,160
other people and I pretty much like talk
to my way into John is getting all the

206
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,250
answers

207
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,990
yeah they took me in that room where the
pic clock ticking clock ticking place

208
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,750
was and we tracked down all the things
they talked me a whole bunch of new

209
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,350
stuff and it was really fun

210
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:42,418
they were inspired to make this mistake
on unfortunately last year I don't even

211
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:51,030
know they were going to think on it
wasn't invited teams until that we got

212
00:24:51,030 --> 00:25:03,970
that phone so this just hearing all
they're all these stories plus many more

213
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:16,390
single their pictures of just the senior
project like this project

214
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:24,370
my best friend really and we were just
sitting there and you sound like a pet

215
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:32,309
project and he just pulled it out but if
you want to join will do so that's

216
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:35,780
that's how I got in here

217
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:46,639
yeah I don't get it done that since I
don't have any pictures

218
00:25:46,640 --> 00:26:03,320
yeah that's it this year is of course
the Keno yesterday was really

219
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,210
interesting listening to people talk
about their jobs in the industry and

220
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:17,520
that I just think it's interesting and
it's truly inspiring to help people

221
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:28,870
middle school students to learn about
this kind of stuff at the vets touch on

222
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:34,020
its been bugging a little bit more about
one thing that's really cool to all of

223
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,550
us is here we come down here and we're
high school soon so we don't really

224
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,669
expect the level is everyone here at the
same level as everyone here because

225
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,530
we're all professionals you been doing
this for years and years you all know a

226
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,899
lot about this but then we come down
here and everyone's really really

227
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,250
exciting and you're all really cool to
us and you to help us learn things get

228
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:02,690
better and you take time out of what
you're doing to help its really

229
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,730
appreciated and that's what has inspired
does is help we've received me want to

230
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:15,390
pass on to other people and so since
since the day that we were saying how we

231
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,770
got started even on the way back from
seeing on weaver's creating challenges

232
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,030
is basically as soon as we came up with
the idea we were all on our computers on

233
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,230
the way back in the car just ideas for
challenge

234
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:36,309
message and so we gotta do you not too
many but a few we have set up the game

235
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:44,480
board likely talk about with the see-saw
caused from work we have created an

236
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,740
awesome website thanks to present here
so I'm messages einer and we sought to

237
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,059
reach out to companies for ships to try
and get this out there since we can do

238
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:04,260
just by ourselves so what we have left
is to set up a registration for the

239
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,990
participants to register for event we
need to set up talks times and we'll

240
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,799
have more on that another side and we
have the other ten thousand things that

241
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:25,850
dan over year end up with that adds to
our backlog yeah I just waved and said

242
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:35,570
it's gonna be pretty awesome

243
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:43,720
joining us here cos weekend so we'd like
to hear your knowledge what do you guys

244
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,790
think the best way is to teach middle
schoolers were still learning about the

245
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,280
best so yes I like an easy way to these
people online cuz that's how we're doing

246
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:03,580
this it's just walking around like a
little trick will be easier for them to

247
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,269
learn and overall the better so we'd
love to hear

248
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:14,589
tell us how to teach the top so there
you have it but basically when you get

249
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:26,529
the idea sort of like this so they got
our site you see here for passive

250
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:41,070
infrastructure that now may be a good
security ideas from general like this

251
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:51,349
really cool and tense like corporations
and personal responses to the winning

252
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:57,908
team gets a graphic school kids so they
can get the influence of middle

253
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:08,759
schoolers nothing really gonna keep
their tents more than accept it we might

254
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:15,919
even put you on the web site saying
thanks this is like a challenger CTF

255
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:24,820
that you don't want to use this if you
hear about it even if you like you're

256
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:35,989
putting the kids so you guys like a
challenge but maybe there have a bill so

257
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:50,349
we could always use more and again this
is about this attack is a presentation

258
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,419
you guys think you're online

259
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:01,210
so you have to give a presentation to
the on there to help them the job

260
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:07,720
aspects of what we're teaching kind of
see why this doesn't realize why it's

261
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:19,500
important to learn it again to relate
the CTL jobs careers and I T industry

262
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:32,740
you can see that everyday citizen
industries in the future the Chilean

263
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:42,090
challenge friends share that with them
to my friend and so the group in God's

264
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:50,629
hands right now again us and it'll bring
your ex and CFT

265
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,630
the slides the stalker

266
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:10,330
copy of this now or wait till later
deputy leader so

267
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:17,039
going back to the website and Z
mentioning about security sensor at a

268
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,330
security conference at you guys go to
website to break into it like 10 or 12

269
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,178
sometimes it we were really nice to know
that that's what we're talking about

270
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,480
when we want to know how to better
improve the security of the website or

271
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,960
the legs and things like that

272
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,830
also going back to the talks was just
talking about his mentioning

273
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:45,590
yes I talked to many times in the past
but if you cannot make it and do the

274
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,299
Google on air and you can't be there
live you can always pre-record the talk

275
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:56,990
and email to us and will look it over
and then we'll get you signed up and let

276
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:02,570
you know you made it or not and then did
you in the door so you can make it there

277
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,500
that day then you can always view record
something so there you don't have to

278
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:17,850
physically be there just online online
there so what is it what is going to

279
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:24,658
teach us although the individual and
cities like middle schoolers just basic

280
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,690
things about like what you're saying
like we're so high school is so we went

281
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,809
up to her like you want to learn new
stuff like programming techniques

282
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:39,889
reciting client-side programming in
security and cooperation like my friends

283
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:51,799
with them and they really need to learn
how to work as a team and I guess is

284
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:59,658
that yes voters up there so if you guys
wanna talk to us on that website as well

285
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:10,210
as anyone had to be walking around out
here to afterwards if any of you guys

286
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,940
want to talk to us you can just
approached us and we'll give you more

287
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,179
information about it

288
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:20,500
to go give out a Twitter again making
contagiosum cell phones auto engineering

289
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:51,079
there's any questions were open to
questions now thank you

290
00:34:51,079 --> 00:35:24,910
but that would definitely help to pay
for the servers in any prizes like they

291
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:34,790
mentioned earlier

292
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:40,190
if you look at the picture you see the
big thing and for those of you that

293
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:48,220
works here last year thats last year's
banner and so we had this plan to cut it

294
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:54,029
down before they took it down and then
just run out within minutes after we

295
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,590
came up with that plan they went and
took it down and so we went to them for

296
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,970
it and so they gave us a small challenge
where to get if we wanted the banner we

297
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,970
had been getting signatures of all the
Utah same members at the comp friends

298
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,290
and think there were like 20 or 24
something like that and we have to do

299
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:19,210
some interesting things to get some of
those signatures like we had handcuffed

300
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:26,900
one of them we had to physically dragged
another one trick someone into doing

301
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:56,560
better

302
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:13,509
that's in the middle school let me know
personally what we think they can do so

303
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:26,900
may be really easy to hear what you guys
think there should be no we don't know

304
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,530
too many middle schoolers will we do we
have to talk to teachers and I think

305
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:36,450
about this at all really challenging but
they may not be able to see how a little

306
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:47,850
extreme yeah so there are challenges
with just four miles or so has he would

307
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,900
challenge they are to see what they do
know if they don't know what they'd like

308
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,200
to wear it and kinda just we can judge
the challenges all that maybe we're

309
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:06,640
going to get everybody we gonna try to
judge how strong the salinger's be and

310
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:15,290
how they should be a range of challenges
yeah that's what you guys tell us

311
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:25,570
recommit ourselves

312
00:38:25,570 --> 00:39:31,650
where we've been and what we learned
that similar yes yes

313
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:46,010
I would say the project after being in
this together we've got to know each

314
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,780
other really well so we've become really
good friends and we are all interested

315
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,610
in the stuff all but one of us know then
spreads have been the same kind before

316
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,950
we all enjoyed even competed in the
capture the flag that we've done at the

317
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,379
school

318
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:11,280
CTF would say we all like to surf side
we got together was like being inside a

319
00:40:11,280 --> 00:41:02,950
common interests and we're just really
good yeah

320
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:19,230
so those of the devices to remove
members of that ilk sinister program

321
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:24,000
provides just said we're not really
concerned about its kids did you see

322
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,359
here seeing here is a plus whatever they
were concerned about the social skills

323
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:39,598
are concerned about just the broad
understanding of the industry and so it

324
00:41:39,599 --> 00:42:00,880
would waste removal service programs do
when we get a good runs

325
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,330
as emails having any other questions
