1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
the slightest for a few minutes if you
can multi multi task though listen eat

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,900
and open up your computer there's a URL
of the bottom of their you probably got

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,910
an email at that same URL just a little
bit ago we would love for you to take

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,800
the survey for the conference pretty
sure that's about as short as we can

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,380
make it but it's a lot of information in
that survey that we used to determine

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,948
how we make the combat a year after year
and so for those of you that have all

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,820
come up to me this year and said
managers crazier and better than ever

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,550
thank you we appreciate the feedback but
the reason for that is because we really

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,099
take seriously the input that we get
back from the conference attendees for

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,510
those of you that didn't say anything to
me because you please give us that

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,489
information be back as well because we
take that into consideration as well i

12
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:03,440
mean there's some people it's hard to
the crowds are some people who think it

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,619
was so nice one hundred and fifty people
in a choir room at Dixie State College

14
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,200
and we could do all these funds
shenanigans and things and Pope that's

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:21,130
best effort over there buddy if they
can't look this far but let's get ahead

16
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,350
to slide will you people are filtering
in here and well these guys were in the

17
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,850
room adjusting the room on the fly

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:37,419
I've got a slide for the AV guys they've
done a credible job this year

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:46,090
and as as far as I understand there was
not a single time during the entire

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:55,789
conference that we heard any microphone
feedback ever so that was good that's

21
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,680
mostly because he's really cool mics but
you don't have to speak down here in

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,840
turn up the game so high and also the
clever use of the in-house audio and

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,580
some other things like that but I'll
come back to that in a minute but while

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,269
we're waiting the extra five minutes
before start time for this please fill

25
00:02:13,269 --> 00:06:51,680
out the survey and I'll be right back

26
00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:03,250
the judge for the vault competition
means the team chance to meet people

27
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,389
come here if you're part of the team
should be about three people or maybe

28
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:28,950
they're not even here there there are we
need you up here for a second

29
00:07:28,950 --> 00:08:03,810
and while you wait for the final
judgment take the survey

30
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:11,930
all right after when we said we would
start in the effort to go along with

31
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:18,530
what we think we've done a good job at
making sure all the talk storm on time

32
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,900
or go ahead and get started so welcome
back its closing ceremonies time time

33
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,989
with all the committee members of
sitting in the audience sign nicely and

34
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,299
and taking a deep breath and say I'm wow
it's been a fun week but it's time to go

35
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:41,228
home so we're ready to be done you're
probably ready to be done as well but

36
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,089
there's a couple of things that I wanted
to cover this couple of words we want to

37
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,510
give out there's a couple of things we
want to talk about and we figure with

38
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,180
multi task by doing the lunch thing at
the same time so that when we're all

39
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,589
done with lunch and things that you guys
can kind of file out head for home trick

40
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,380
or treat with the kids tomorrow whatever
it is you're gonna do and such

41
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,540
wanted to remind everybody that sink on
as a production of the Utah st.

42
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,089
organization if you haven't had an
opportunity while you were here to learn

43
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,270
more about you see an organization that
kind of sad but at the same time it's a

44
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,280
group of network security professionals
throughout the state of Utah and beyond

45
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,610
now there's members from all over the
place where we share a lot of

46
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,730
information we want to make you aware of
this organization it's free to join the

47
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,710
organization and contribute to be part
of its glitches that we had in some of

48
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,130
these sign up and betting systems have
been fixed so if you have previously

49
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,500
tried and haven't heard anything back
those issues are six we're going to be

50
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,450
doing a lot of buildings over the next
couple of days for sure and so will you

51
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,830
hear back from us one way or another and
then I'm not going to bore you with the

52
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,890
details on how it all works because we
talked about it during the opener

53
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,459
suffice it to say it with a buddy that's
part of the industrial organization help

54
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,140
you out

55
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:14,330
and I'm getting to the works and seven
he did remind me this earlier but if

56
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,810
you've already signed up you don't need
to sign up again we have all that

57
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,030
information the vetting process email
system and other things that we were

58
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,610
that we use

59
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,910
wasn't working properly came down to a
time sync issue between Amazon and our

60
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,930
server so next thing and appropriately
so we want to thank our sponsors this

61
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,859
year but reason why you have a really
cool bag around your neck is because of

62
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,690
sponsors like this

63
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,610
Valley Electric proactive network
management comp unit at nine Aruba or

64
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,330
deny it

65
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,530
checkpoints Adobe CenturyLink balcom
Bluehost and a few others that have

66
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,660
donated either a lot of time like the
Utah Education Network we can't run a

67
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,160
conference with five UN employees on the
committee without having you to an

68
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,670
organization don't get a lot of our time
to prepare for this conference but it's

69
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,880
these vendors it's these people that
make it possible for us to do cool

70
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,140
things like the Badgers allows us to buy
the audio-visual equipment be sure that

71
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,740
we needed to make sure that nobody
here's a sweetie Mike ever again and so

72
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,790
we appreciate their involvement I saw
you took some time to visit them out

73
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,180
there in the vendor Expo will only let
them come for two days some of my be

74
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,130
here today still but we only let them
set up their wares and talk to you guys

75
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,740
out there as vendors for two of the days
officially so that you don't get

76
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,510
overwhelmed with it but at the same time
it compresses it down so you can go

77
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,900
visit them you have two days to do it
and it doesn't interfere too much with

78
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,610
the conference because we'd like to be
vendor-neutral as much as possible here

79
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,790
with a lot of the products you won't see
many product recommendations come from

80
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,390
any of the committee's stocks

81
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,960
write the next people that need large
thank you and a big round of applause

82
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:35,620
for these folks so number of years but
this year as well and spread else in the

83
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,130
room

84
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:42,040
good as he's not that I can say this out
loud just say that he's got a lot of

85
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,910
employees that works a lot of nights and
weekends but probably a few hours during

86
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,120
the day as well helping make this
congress possible program in the badge

87
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,500
arranging networks of all those other
things these guys have done an

88
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,370
incredible job for us and it's kinda sad
that we're probably not going to be here

89
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:06,590
next year to continue to take a full
benefit of Weaver says university's

90
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:13,650
hospitality but will most certainly
continue to use their employer alright

91
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:19,660
and then I want to thank you the
attendees for coming war spending your

92
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,750
kind a little bit of your money to come
here to maybe learn something new to

93
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,280
experience something new and such
because truly you guys are what makes it

94
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,959
impossible what makes it important for
us and what really gives us the drive to

95
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,890
continue to do something that is
becoming

96
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,960
unwieldy and requires a lot more time
than it used to

97
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,750
so the next thing is real quickly upload
one more time for the survey so this is

98
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,900
how we continue to make same kind as
cool as it is we pick your feedback both

99
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,140
positive and negative and we do our very
best to make sure that anything you guys

100
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,790
are telling us it's considered as we do
planning for the following year we learn

101
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,650
things along the way we have learned
this year that you sign 600 people up to

102
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,569
the conference and everybody comes on
that first day of the second day at nine

103
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,750
o'clock in the morning everybody sitting
down there the parking lot still trying

104
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,320
to get a shuttle over to the

105
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,600
conference and the first three types of
the day are pretty wimpy we learned a

106
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,880
lot of other things along the way that
we take back what we want to make sure

107
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,240
we're getting your input so please take
the time to fill out that survey I would

108
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:45,400
say there's prices involved in my phone
keeps ringing no actually it's not

109
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:53,819
ringing sorry this is the Twitter buzz
going on that's right this is actually

110
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,840
let me start their just cause they've
sent up four seconds this guy must be on

111
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,380
Twitter 24 hours a day because within a
couple of seconds of sync on tweeting

112
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,600
something he's favored at it and
retweeted it like seconds so we

113
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,280
appreciated in those of you that have
access to those types of social media

114
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,589
things we'd love to get the word out
about the conference is one of the

115
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,340
reasons why we think that it's growing
as a couple questions in the survey so

116
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,010
we can validate some of those results
once again I wanna think the AV guys

117
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:33,140
they've done an incredible job this year
making this work are you center wherever

118
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,000
you're at ease in the back waving his
hand the guy is amazing and so we

119
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:52,650
appreciate him so I don't reveal what I
want to rebuild before I do it no one

120
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,240
other thing there were so many talks
that we accepted this year there were

121
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,970
very few that we didn't when we did the
culture percent presentations as time

122
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,720
goes on we're gonna be a little bit more
selective we've got some great speakers

123
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,140
we've got some excellent speakers in the
event that you were choosing whether

124
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,680
managed to get talks going on or four
get talks going on and I can't I can

125
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,489
only be in one place at a time we did
our best this year to record every

126
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,900
single pot and I think that we did it
with a few minor exceptions with audio

127
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,090
issues and some other things and so
within a couple of weeks I'm not gonna

128
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,170
give you a deadline

129
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,839
we're gonna go through we're gonna post
reduce all of those and make sure that

130
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,329
they have any bad words leaped out I'm
sure there weren't very many bad words I

131
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,769
know I said damn a couple of times in
mind my talks but yes we believe them

132
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,820
out but will also make sure that you
know all of the leaders on both ends and

133
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,100
suffered corrupt we're going to post
them and make them public

134
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,850
it'll be a first for sync on to have all
of the talks out there for you to hold

135
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:07,429
watch so you don't miss a darn thing so
that crew right there seemed a given no

136
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,600
well impose Rav crew they work together
to make this happen and it was quite the

137
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:45,080
season give them around and was raised
for something that we threw together a

138
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:54,120
couple of weeks before the conference
call so if we were to throw maybe a

139
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,580
couple of thousand dollars at it and
maybe a couple of months of inspiration

140
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,120
added you think we could make it better

141
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:11,350
that's what's coming next year for sure
so was way way either moved ahead but

142
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,199
without you

143
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,290
was extremely successful and we're
awarding of prizes to the group that got

144
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:27,178
through it the best and so would be sexy
as hell group you know who you are

145
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,330
because they want and I'll explain why

146
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:47,060
come up soon as we need to recognize
alright so while we're there at the

147
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,000
registration table for a little while
let people come to take a look at them

148
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,460
if you didn't play it

149
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,950
unexplained real quick how it works you
were going through the challenges of

150
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,540
physical security challenges to defeat
motion sensors you have to pick your way

151
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,920
through doors and all kinds of other
things and ultimately all the successful

152
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,290
teams ended up with a bag of tamperproof
bag that had a USB stick unit and USB

153
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,639
stick of nothing more than just a
password hash that they had to crack to

154
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,260
prove that they were able to get into
the bag and then they were instructed to

155
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,550
bring the bag back to us and handed to
us as if it hadn't been tampered and so

156
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,649
you can see I mean these are top of the
line bags that we use these guys did a

157
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,050
credible job back 61 of this one right
here and we were elected out there and

158
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,930
nobody was able to find out how they got
into it but they were able to get into

159
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,840
the back

160
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,169
access the USB and pull the information
on crack the passwords we had to ask

161
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:58,690
them how they did it seriously we have
to ask tell them from switching

162
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:08,020
way two seconds I just building this
this ok so we decided that we wanted to

163
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,440
be really really micro holes eaten so we
started with some lanting needles at

164
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,480
over thirty three ph anybody that knows
anything about electronics and five

165
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,100
boards in about 18 million with 33 notes
that that's going to work

166
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,449
well because we we documented all this
already up and everything

167
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,919
videos so then we switch to 2016 plenty
needles where you gonna poke the holes

168
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,590
so we're looking at different places and
where did you put it to the top in the

169
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:49,668
corner turns out the deep purple was an
excellent camouflage roles with the

170
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:59,580
ability to do a little bit of a shot at
very slightly holes actually just wasn't

171
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,210
built in a building if you try to mess
with it too much

172
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:17,409
really really difficult to tell so we
definitely Friday one USB sticks and we

173
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:22,570
had a cracking rigs in a state of us
$200 to do it all straight three trips

174
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:29,450
to Walmart they love us now at eleven
o'clock a trip to the sporting good

175
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,640
store for some pretty please do not work
but essentially what we're doing is

176
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,350
telling the USB through the bag at 74
pins the ports happens is when you

177
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,580
ground those out of work and yet the
researchers be so holding the bag

178
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,949
training get it just right without
creating too big a hole I'm sitting

179
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,690
there trying to get to work it was just
fun and then hashing rig was awesome for

180
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,890
speaking the videos I need to be edited

181
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,330
so we'll make sure they positive because
it is pretty cool to watch what they did

182
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:13,070
so what we have you spent $200 on this
challenge we've got $30 rubber duckies

183
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:23,340
so there's three of them you can
separate them so if you do come up only

184
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,929
these bags up here but all the only
thing you can tell they're just kinda

185
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,880
little ridges right here on the carpet
this and completely passed our

186
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,540
inspections we didn't see it we didn't
feel it that's how they got into the bag

187
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:45,930
the USB still in there and so on so for
now the runner that's true are likely to

188
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,480
prove that they got into that bag

189
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,420
alright thanks guys down there was the
name of the other group I can't remember

190
00:22:51,420 --> 00:23:00,150
who you are mister chunky church Chatzky
is whatever they have to come up with

191
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,980
the group name pretty quick and so was
whatever you guys did the second best

192
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,300
it's almost perfectly the same but they
did a slightly different strategy I

193
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,440
won't make them explain it but we got a
little price for them as well but what

194
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,270
they did is they took advantage of a
flaw in the bag where when you seal it

195
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,960
if you don't see just perfectly crystal
Ridge at the little seal appearance of

196
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,000
the used that they cut the whole thing
and were able to sneak it out there and

197
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,200
then that whole richest held it together
and we did find that one but it took us

198
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,010
awhile so there are runners up and they
get these really cool alpha wireless

199
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,150
devices 5 I have to say that because
they don't get all the stuff to us that

200
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,440
allows for really easy and fun WEP
cracking WPA crack in the stuff like

201
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,100
that so the three of these three guys

202
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:10,030
and all the rest you guys failed
miserably because with but to be fair we

203
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,590
did go through and we had the layman
people come by the had no idea the back

204
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,370
construction was says hey can you see if
there's any evidence of its been

205
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,668
tampered with and there were some the
past the layman muster mustard mustard

206
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:30,870
people's wouldn't hurt so good and so
for the most part almost all the bags we

207
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:37,959
got back somebody wasn't looking for the
the cut for the sea or whatever that was

208
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,340
violated nobody would have known so you
guys all did a great job we've got some

209
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,539
great submissions back alright let's
move ahead wanna talk about our one and

210
00:24:47,539 --> 00:25:05,210
only one case nevermind blackbirds there
is one black bags contest at CENTCOM

211
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,330
will probably expand that in the next
couple of years I think that with the

212
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,340
time and energy were going to put into
expanding the bolts and what it's going

213
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,070
to be an asshole tamper-evident kind of
challenge that we're going to actually

214
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,720
break out and do it in court next year
we'll probably have a couple of extra

215
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,850
black badges were gonna work next year
but so far we award one black patch per

216
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,719
year to the winner of the hacker
steroids game and so to talk about the

217
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,970
hacker silence before we announce who
the winner is everything else going by

218
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,429
Josh kalbitor gamemaster to come up who
has done an excellent job

219
00:25:42,429 --> 00:26:18,419
the game and whatever else he's got good
so this year of participation there were

220
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,029
over 200 different players at least one
key that was more than a third of the

221
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:31,990
conference also there were so many hours
playing able to the game from open to

222
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:38,929
close during those in the hours only to
our 4 a.m. and fighting in window with

223
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:55,110
not one key was tried so there was one
player that had 48 hours hours he is a

224
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,939
key so you take that there's only 2 p.m.
at it when I was the entire conference

225
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:15,779
there were two unsolved puzzle is on the
board one of them was a black box

226
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:20,860
challenge and one of them was a fun
challenge that someone blew up at the

227
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:32,658
end of June 20 lot of fun with the new
division method a new scoring method the

228
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:38,090
game was really dynamic we are a lot of
competition between 1st 2nd 3rd even the

229
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,000
10th and 20th person would be the top
five for a while and then

230
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,260
it was so broad that it was a lot of one
it was a fun spectator sport as well as

231
00:27:49,260 --> 00:28:01,140
it runs scoring with your Japanese style
you had she tripped over 100 200 300 400

232
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,640
and 500 and he scored a five
hundred-point you kept her boyfriend

233
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:15,570
again this year because of open 1,000
points and you the first until the next

234
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:22,750
person sold it and then your 1020 came
five hundred and they got I wondered so

235
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:30,650
that Russia's volatile in the game that
you may be sick 10,000 points until

236
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:38,530
mister sullivan also you have five
thousand it was lots of fun fun

237
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:57,710
CNN's eulogy R we had six vote codes
actually committed to the game

238
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:09,880
61 hitting challenge to deny gets all
challenges that were scattered

239
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:18,820
throughout the conference admitted there
were almost 5,000 attempts against the

240
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,510
server for key

241
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:30,260
thirty-four people were Live On the
Border Agency and I had a lot of

242
00:29:30,260 --> 00:30:29,639
god-given big and all my other proposals

great together together and take all of
them load normally the hackers Challenge

252
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:20,739
game should have this line of earlier to
normally the challenge game as kind of a

253
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:24,349
run it and I'll try and get some puzzles
together and last minute we're in this

254
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:28,289
together has been working on it for
months and did an incredible job give

255
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:39,759
Josh a round of applause us life for you

256
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,349
ok so let's talk really quickly about
the conference we talked a little bit

257
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:48,259
about some of the things that were
planning on doing in the future so at

258
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:54,659
this point because of the size the
logistics are keen and other things

259
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:02,029
we've decided that were very likely I
can't sit 400% very likely going to move

260
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:06,419
the location of saying next year and
right now we're looking for that site to

261
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:11,700
be Provo hope that helps some people
relieve some of the travel for some

262
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,939
increases the level of trouble for
others but we feel that there's a number

263
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,730
of different reasons to move the
conference some of the ones that we've

264
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,299
talked about our it just needs to move
so that makes it easier for certain

265
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:26,949
people to come that haven't been here
for a long time

266
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,250
the logistics and the room that we're
going to be growing into to build an

267
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,510
entire room for the ball next year's
gonna require a lot of room and so we

268
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,069
were limited in what we can do here
because of fire code and some of these

269
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:44,619
other issues and such so I wanna talk
about that for a minute let you know

270
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,359
that if we can pull it off

271
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,869
we're gonna move into trouble if we
can't pull it off it might be in Salt

272
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:55,029
Lake City and if we really can't pull it
off we might be back here next year but

273
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:58,609
we've a state has agreed to let us come
back if we need to

274
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,109
that's great we thank them for that
right I got a couple of other people

275
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:08,589
that we need to think in hand and talk
about first of all we want to thank all

276
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:16,990
of our volunteers

277
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:24,240
for the first time it sank on we
actually had a volunteer list that we

278
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,618
could pull from and have people helps
out what eV

279
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,900
have helped us our registration and
things how a nice was it on Tuesday

280
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,640
morning to night stand in line with 400
people want your badges right because of

281
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,810
the volunteers and things we did that
almost nobody stood in line at all for

282
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,330
registration

283
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,470
they did incredible job and they were
hiding in the background

284
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,100
doing the things they needed to do to
make the numbers on a smooth as possible

285
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,250

ever to talk about

286

the way for the first time ever we

287
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:10,440
haven't had some major mess up with
registration and let's not go through in

288
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,790
like manner

289
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:17,270

recognized I have this light during the

290
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,090
opener but there is a lot that goes into
saint com there's registration our

291

294
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,690
