1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,160
morning because I can start your mail
with some new stuff so my name is Jeremy

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,900
brown and this is my presentation on a
cloud of insecurity and a gentleman

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,590
earlier question because it does sound
when do you expect I'll go into deeper

4
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,780
but we are talking about NAS devices in
this context which are about an able to

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,309
do things like seeing your Facebook
secure social media secure photos from

6
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,730
your computer to the to the hard drive
essentially consists of a nice drive and

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,538
interface networking cable itself but
also do you think online to whatever

8
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,219
company that manufactured the vendor
also provides the capabilities are

9
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,930
getting more injured

10
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,890
under the agenda of the introduction
industry to more than one of the targets

11
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,860
in the reason as earlier can you please
go see these are the defenders who

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:19,320
devised talking about and in most of
which are fixing some of them are

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,089
already so you'll see you'll see
throughout it will go into solution to

14
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,000
the vendors how they communicate with me
and conclusion from where we go from

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,550
here

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:41,300
Jeremy brown curly independent
researcher consulted during a Windows

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,179
security locks security to the malware
protection center doing a malware and

18
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,960
other security research

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:02:00,530
to table 31 essence little bitter person
sharing begins in and we can't just up

20
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:10,690
there and do this for a while so we're
not talking about is it about acting I

21
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,750
didn't take the firmware chips

22
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:23,640
didn't open any of these I just looked
at them and what they're not know

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,470
software this advice

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,780
CDs are included in the packages or
anything like that

25
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,580
no no bias was mainly just just about
summed himself and communicating them

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,330
and what they provide and they want to
get security or probably would be a true

27
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:52,200
talking about it from the networks the
land is based on gateway of course

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,569
controls on access to give it

29
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:01,819
you can end the division urgency over
networks and and have a communication

30
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,708
like that but it was the video on your
Gateway where they can be accessed the

31
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:14,000
Internet where they can be designed and
the other two great hurry to promote

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,250
vulnerabilities for some local roots so
they're pretty pretty critical that

33
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,389
aspect and everything that we talked
about so I got a question with for those

34
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:33,310
you actually set up the device in the US
were completed and gangsters so when you

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,060
when I did about since they were
configured but none of the settings were

36
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:51,719
changed it was a russian girl I wanna
know how my cars has been on a blog

37
00:03:51,719 --> 00:04:04,269
detailing routers with photographs maybe
maybe maybe explosively and all these

38
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,090
things that are they really affect your
life so you don't want to know what the

39
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,509
security is good for you

40
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,410
internet working for them on you at all
times

41
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:21,750
on Twitter bit ago kevin Mitnick had
tweeted about democracy and its daily

42
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,650
this one devices will be looking at say
we'll see just how much the security

43
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,390
there already was being sarcastic

44
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,870
Christianity

45
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,990
people look at the interview talks where
are you get devices but they're mostly

46
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,620
just either borrowed ones order
estimator there's something like Arduino

47
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,890
or something like that but these aren't
they do take $200 in in in maybe in the

48
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,030
future I'll arrange I did have to buy it
and still didn't I did acquire them

49
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,219
through the city means of course

50
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,930
doing the security you can get a web
site start now

51
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:11,350
excitable and start almost nothing
really wrong with that

52
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:19,380
so this game is on the website sales of
devices not talk about abs Amazon's

53
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,710
cloud services so I just want to show
you that these huge dinner benders that

54
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,390
are having these devices are you
stopping data storage so it's just not

55
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,900
the right now there's a ton of different
vendors have these three day which one

56
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,039
would that which i think are most
prevalent in the ones that you know I

57
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,650
kinda sorta but like most reviewed yet
rated most of all things like that the

58
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,630
ones are out there

59
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,990
third of the most prevalent out there
but what is it about that is different

60
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:04,160
kinds of BS as yours though Microsoft
many have you not talking about the ones

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,580
that are losses would you like network
attacks towards so it's a hard job with

62
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:17,680
Ethernet jack but these are drugs jack's
not going to more about that too

63
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,850
beating us is just glad you're safe and
secure social media access to the

64
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,229
internet you know that things you with
all the things you expect when they

65
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:37,568
accept connected device for talking
tells him to the targets

66
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:48,959
to the players here like a disease of
the mind which was just there's no space

67
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,249
around how they go away without
copyright stuff but there's room for

68
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:59,430
Seagate and later

69
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,440
here in a few days is always say under
control about safety and security

70
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,660
storage lazy ensures a hundred percent
security from data loss I could be taken

71
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,310
a few different ways you could assume
they're talking about earlier I guess

72
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,010
it's the only way they could be talking
even though that's kind of weird to say

73
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,620
but the market is if they got there
there there marking these very secure

74
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:46,080
devices to send the first quarter about
6:30 or storage open towards

75
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,770
GPS and change your webserver any
browser so many services open on the

76
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,109
rise

77
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:06,120
network that's a lot of the taxers
situations who devised you can see to

78
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,490
route as those are your your account
already has her dribble too so there's

79
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,170
no local taxes necessary at this point
distribution that the central users

80
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:22,350
divested maxims and comes with just
really strange maximum to minimum as

81
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:31,670
early as stable open yet secure so they
just execution of the central and then

82
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,460
there's no root password so maybe they
welcomed us login as root password right

83
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,040
well usually an essay in this is Damon
configuration there's no password to

84
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,809
login

85
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:51,880
just kind of mister security true like
that but it is a hazardous route so we

86
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,210
did say there's a PvP server running
here but so so even if we have to access

87
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:05,860
through trip to keep server her
emotional don't tax system shall

88
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,540
so happens that the web servers running
as root so we can login via FTP of the

89
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,469
mood AP script something to distract you
to command the system if the web server

90
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,220
is running as root on executing commands
through so simply at the end of time the

91
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,260
band of Weber world where all the
website is hosted and that we have

92
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:36,319
removed three TV and the web server
running a skirt that is total nonsense

93
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,640
school security at this point I talked
about so many times

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,740
social network integration in particular
has to begin operations so you can get

95
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,360
on your credentials it'll sink it all of
your photos to Facebook and and all that

96
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,649
good stuff keeps these credentials in a
world football's world readable bow on

97
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,600
the 31 has access to the guys can get
access to your token in the tokenism

98
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,510
they met once again you you get a token
which represents your session and it has

99
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,850
a expiration date know that but
essentially if you were able to take it

100
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,949
up so you can login and democrat user
for whatever period time this until set

101
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:33,819
to expire so I get it opens it's just
Facebook and in your name and and token

102
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:42,089
in his gutsy a your access to so
remember we have remote races and in

103
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:50,709
jail but if we can abuses further to
steal the show you the token we can even

104
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:56,649
do things so this is a state showing you
want to go to different schools of

105
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,079
tokens so you look up to look at
diffusers photos videos you'll get a

106
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,920
friend list

107
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:11,269
and we just read a quick trip that uses
Facebook to use the token in 10

108
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:17,730
different now and only do we have to
compromise with Abbas wherever it exists

109
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,310
will override access we also have access
to the Facebook profile and we can do

110
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,779
things like to their friends get their
photos things like that

111
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:35,990
believing it's just hard drive that's
fine you for what you do on your

112
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,730
facebook accounts well just likes

113
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:53,199
few other things to protect her and web
resources on these devices just because

114
00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:03,579
you don't get to be aged 13 and there's
a lot of the bugs are also on the vices

115
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:08,380
and you can access is extremely through
the web interface there's no password on

116
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,750
that system this HTML files on the
device system leaving just as the

117
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:22,320
username password just littered it all
different files mp3 files everywhere and

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,209
there's also a CK W Steve diamond and it
runs on and on but you can see in just

119
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:35,560
eight hours you and hope rising so its
sittings and now hud stupid question and

120
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,199
you can disturbingly crash the daemon
running this interpreting these messages

121
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,649
just got your message

122
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:54,889
this particular device future where over
the internet even remotely now into the

123
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,800
device so that was interesting to see
how that work more so does your Italian

124
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,829
agent so that when a jet that converted
it would still managed script they

125
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:20,128
converted to modern to run on Linux and
uses it to do is about access so tell

126
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:25,809
story as I didn't really useful but it
was interesting to look at in some cases

127
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:34,118
we can you tell if you're able to guess
which is the one big step but people to

128
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:41,269
do that then you can browse around which
we've tripled anyways so administrator

129
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,959
is when you're walking in remotely
through the remote access feature that's

130
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,760
kind of interesting

131
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:56,410
to undergo again I wanted to do not
access the internet on a look at night

132
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,650
during certain scripts

133
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,449
that's one of the things that i kidded
user to reboot I can you make to open up

134
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:10,920
a command shell our search for something
like that so next had introduced

135
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,370
personnel

136
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,910
way to sort of food do they were pretty
good on this thing because they cannot

137
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:29,209
succeed where they will put it as my
user so I wasn't able to change startup

138
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,130
script

139
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,900
able to change it as my current user so
it's kind of strange where you log in

140
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,790
your browsing with your privileges
wupload things we still on for the user

141
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:51,300
so kind of strange so I could get a
remote shell just leave with D user but

142
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,079
I was able to get a remote with this but
nonetheless it also runs a media

143
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,380
cervical django Django relies on a
secret key to do autumn's cryptography

144
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,960
cryptographic functions so if you look
at the line above says make this unique

145
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,910
and don't share with anyone know this is
a file system of the device and shipped

146
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,449
to everyone so I don't think they
generate this on fresh install every

147
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,810
device either

148
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,979
but you can take it once you have a
secret key compromise all these things

149
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,310
that you secretly majengo a star Jayson
Nix the password reset talking functions

150
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,650
of security things like that I didn't
return it if they generate this every

151
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,740
time but if you even if they don't
realize they do they're still able to

152
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,290
still this because you have heard that
route and then our colleague compromise

153
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,910
the devise a compromise everyone using
the bikes because everything that uses

154
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,810
Django so it's centered at work

155
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:04,699
we talk about remove root local stores
that just opened a store right to it as

156
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,820
we should go and you can also still the
Facebook talkin to do interesting things

157
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:23,330
are going to next target do you like
about meeting and we see that till now

158
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:35,220
is open to write a story day now using
Fedora 12 which is used or stored 42

159
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:44,089
right now we can see fit or 12 was
published back in 2010 running super old

160
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,240
kernel version

161
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:54,010
and then when I look at this time latest
so that was definitely a sign of things

162
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:02,170
to come so we just too dude seafood and
got root is not so easy

163
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:12,379
grateful just to get roots but well C
they have been around areas that are

164
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,050
enabled to run as

165
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:23,030
privileges as root around and found that
they had sued greeted the pipeline no

166
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:29,290
idea of what you'd ever want to do that
some work around for some bug dad we

167
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:38,240
need to run this is route so let's
assume that you just you just say ok

168
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,130
you're running as root

169
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:50,520
UID 2000 and text you back and then we
have the full route on the video device

170
00:17:50,520 --> 00:18:01,000
so this is not the commerce and shipping
with the device was from 2014 July 2014

171
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,050
days and this is early this year but the
last sunday wasn't October 2014 when I

172
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:19,120
worked as you can see there is no update
available so even if they were security

173
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,860
updates the update mechanism up some not
even able to update its 26 thing just a

174
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:36,189
security at that point even update to
get the new features runs his 069 some

175
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,740
of you may have heard of it doesn't
really good too many cooks in the

176
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,200
kitchen

177
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,950
detailing TR 69 is a mess it's a
terribly

178
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,090
its true provisioning

179
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,610
things like that it runs on a ton of
devices haradim

180
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:00,418
devices from this and as for you know
obviously these things have searched

181
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,380
their like ok we know we want to be able
to provision of these devices and scale

182
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,350
things but there's absolutely no
security and in the end it runs deaths

183
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,820
in Austin St our server in the server
and debug mode just like a look at the

184
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,139
best messages back and forth and it's
interesting information they're just

185
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:31,090
passing so messages back and forth like
the manufacture just sensitive data

186
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,029
between client server and the service
actually able to do other things the

187
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:42,490
device so you could see this is you know
this is over so he had me in the middle

188
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,620
be pretty devastating here

189
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,929
look at your $69 community cooks are
cute super interesting things that are

190
00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:04,030
bad about the program but the good news
is you can't just kill the process but

191
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,600
it's going to jail break things we need
to revise

192
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,280
to make it more security for securing
jailbreak but different story

193
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:24,660
Professional coders they had running the
software for the device is literally had

194
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:33,040
they didn't even take the time to remove
the guys name or say they just left on

195
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:54,470
his full name and his personal email
address the modern the biggest thing

196
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:05,050
about the biggest security found was
once again to Weber test test on

197
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:11,110
JavaScript really interested so if I
just go to test sites email I did a

198
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,370
command prompt and that is kind of a
dream

199
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:21,739
commander what you just did you know
this is not usually accessible you know

200
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:29,500
this is probably on their device and now
asking you what you wanna do wif decide

201
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:39,720
what can I do to help for commands in a
contested led I can message about seven

202
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,059
o'clock last year

203
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:50,840
most interesting one was key and kisses
her secret key very interesting

204
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:58,080
dumping T return to American values
probably sixteen months which is

205
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,519
security but you know it sounds very
reluctant to do at this point where did

206
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:13,799
you grow g2 and actually it's embedded
in the flash drives the black mirror in

207
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:19,179
the box that opens up the deputy block
and at a very particular offset he gets

208
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,929
the secret key though you can't imagine
that I don't think they ship at the

209
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:31,409
security in each device four ever
devised that would just be terribly

210
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,080
expensive to do so at this point in
history

211
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,100
universal to all prices and/or you need
to do to get its name from

212
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:50,699
so I really useful in a lot of time
looking at what is your excuse for not

213
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,780
ask the vendor you know when they're not
telling that only stocks dunaway to lead

214
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,110
your secret G what does it do so I asked
them and they said she is used for

215
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,689
remote assistance service I don't
remember looking that feature on the

216
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,419
device

217
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:14,340
what is the remote systems are you can
disable that in a person's preferences

218
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:23,480
there's nothing there nothing about
remote assistance serves to read with

219
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,010
them

220
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,330
communicative like this important read
ridiculously bad but they eventually

221
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:38,949
said not at liberty to disclose any more
details about how are you secret key I

222
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:45,929
guess really got me interested in but
it's early days of the needs of these

223
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:46,770
devices

224
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,220
move on to the next one and I want to
come back to later but that in the end

225
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,260
up working out

226
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:00,650
if you look at the basement article
about the conversation it's ridiculously

227
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,720
like back and forth like and what what
does this do and and are cause for this

228
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,110
project that is up there and they just
keep

229
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:22,219
he does but we know it's very important
according to do so for this device just

230
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,860
looks are just nice and you get a
command prompt the user access and

231
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:35,600
excess a suitor at PyCon boundaries
still believe and 369 trouble and other

232
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:43,549
supplies you only please turn off you
don't need it the most popular here

233
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:59,090
marshals this is the over commercial
about the device and this this is a

234
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:05,520
military prosecutor like this that we
protect you but its role eighties

235
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,360
European which Arizona

236
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:18,409
there's actually parking security in the
commercial on TV as important as the

237
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,970
most interesting was the motto of
indication that they don't tell you this

238
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,900
but this is because that's exactly what
areas

239
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,050
you always logged in as administrator
but that's all you have to jump through

240
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:39,810
hoops to choose device look at the
documentation of the password so you can

241
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,460
see it switching implementing the close
as you'll go to the login page up in a

242
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:57,910
CPS paging through and it's just walking
in with whatever it is so so you have

243
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:08,060
full access to the web administrator
access to what you see here see you to

244
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,860
the media server that also has no
authentication by the phone devices more

245
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,100
there's just no authentication

246
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:25,129
there is a lot of hoops to turn on it is
there some point but it's wide open

247
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,830
so if you look I did not get strains on
the server in withdrawal to control the

248
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:38,270
device restarted rebuild commands 1994
commands probably a hundred different

249
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:49,590
things you can do this over with no
password so when one reason mention was

250
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:55,209
there was a teacher from the future to
back up to the metadata able to control

251
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,560
the content and i couldnt anywhere else
but I was able to create a device like

252
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:09,060
this this is actually a very interesting
but it really explain anything but still

253
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:17,620
something that shouldn't really happened
was giving it injects many characters

254
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:25,739
into the way to drop all these media
folder any point you want you to order

255
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,870
the you want to build a database so you
can just play with your playlists and

256
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:40,419
you don't have to you today to visit so
when it builds this it passes these 228

257
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,960
as shelters to to build all these things
out made a believer with the grid via

258
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,020
Excel

259
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,610
so what I did was an interesting
medicare jews often in the public just

260
00:27:51,610 --> 00:28:01,909
beyond us in a public folder he calls a
rebuilt to the commands we just listen

261
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,640
they're not gonna get it and you could
get a remote right back with a super

262
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:15,270
great actor but it's not working this
from internal contestants employed there

263
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,200
are you guys really shouldn't do this
you should really fix it I guarantee

264
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,830
they knew that this was something that
you you would have to look into it but

265
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:30,780
they did succeed in as it is not so one
thing I like that since we have the the

266
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,600
auto syndication and wanted to see if I
could just bring the device or so I can

267
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:47,760
restore it I can do but just simply
uploading a random firmware image and

268
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,110
other in the firmware image I literally
just tried a computer that neither one

269
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,540
of us so to be fair and balanced
all-time greats like the devil is ok now

270
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,350
see the packaging energy use is using
the bombs so

271
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:14,949
now the random ok let me do that to this
is the process of saying what I can do

272
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,210
and letting it tell me these really
deserve to be resource description error

273
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:26,039
messages to see confined to actually do
for the uploading from where it says

274
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,299
invalid premier package from those
something's gotta be different update

275
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:36,960
packages and we know there's some sanity
checks so that I don't even want to

276
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,280
bring it by asking for and receiving a
remote I'm gonna sell medicare covers

277
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:51,250
again and processes on the on the device
I can see that he likes the idea of

278
00:29:51,250 --> 00:30:02,750
command in the middle of resulting from
an ejection there but even more suited

279
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:09,480
to the user that the web server is
executing this command as supervisors

280
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:20,790
excuse me I'm running is so great now
have an excuse and how many times do

281
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:30,000
that if the API execute runtime 283
times so directly to Navy three chances

282
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,450
to inject commands to see you on every
one of these injections as far as user

283
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:49,160
whichever one you so this is a device
that PHP you can see also that we can

284
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:56,049
inject medicare jurors in the in the box
Ltd just using description so they're

285
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:00,000
just demanded action everywhere this is
another example of the 293 how to use it

286
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,070
another attack vectors new device just
simply tell you what you want and there

287
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,879
was some security comments on these
files to so admin application request

288
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,330
routing line only said there's a
disconnect between just imagine there's

289
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,449
two team begins our company before

290
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,490
know there's a ton of different teams
working on your pictures and they can be

291
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,900
discontinued a drought but I can just
imagine there's two teams forty one of

292
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,610
the main code for the UI and other team
working on another feature maybe the

293
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,610
auto indication feature

294
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,159
and this one goodwill that's ok we had
to have been up indication that the

295
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,980
authentication future comes but we won't
just be really easy for everyone to use

296
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:59,799
so we're so did you read the comments do
this but then there's really force

297
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,570
because of the new feature that the
disconnect between the two teams one

298
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:12,899
wanting to do one thing security and
another basket shoot

299
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:21,340
insanity demands to try their
environment reductions in the WebUI the

300
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:29,990
department is working as a Jason Terry
and other than occasion is a huge killer

301
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,470
for this device

302
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,730
so secret talks

303
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:46,980
on stage and I'll tell you why later to
grant the end of this device was

304
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:54,360
interesting to date acquired lacy
recently two years ago so they're kind

305
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,479
of like to controlling vested interest
in NYC this point so they're going to

306
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,940
combine like to see a central with the
latest box there's going to be some

307
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:10,419
somethings gonna happen in the future I
would say but I see a lazy to look if we

308
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:17,000
start the adding user accounts via
social security perspective not very

309
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,590
good at the root password able to resist
other ways to repair it was pretty

310
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,879
random so there's not really a big shot
to do anything with their user accounts

311
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,530
you wouldn't have to read about it if
you don't want to the west was able to

312
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,080
help approval to steer it runs a nice
backup script and it's available on the

313
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,918
web UI with any user id like to use it

314
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,200
so we're able to the disassembly of it
and we can see this calling core utils

315
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:01,700
to create those copy is just daily basis
according to package to see that there

316
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:09,319
is taking shelter here so we go to the
dashboard and data backup and just

317
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:14,639
created job name the job test again in
Jackson medicare covers and click Start

318
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:23,139
which is at Ukraine's so it doesn't just
do this ad with with regular user

319
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:31,220
privileges and execute the commands as
the research thing and now we can use

320
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:37,750
whatever plans you want from there so we
have privileges from the web UI to

321
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,750
and there's a bunch of other commands so
please and other bonus bucks there as

322
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:54,820
well as a media server called its power
PCB culminate mr Beattie empty damage to

323
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,240
the word it's basically runs as root

324
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,700
I don't think this is not a big deal
literally changed the run as root so I

325
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,270
cannot see very defensive depth

326
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,620
familiar with that concept thing about
this device

327
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:24,270
theoretical but it's actually happened
was we found her dental devices later we

328
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:33,030
see integration in a daddy username
password server everything that uses and

329
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:39,320
this also documented through December to
say we have that we have walked into

330
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,890
that we just never doing nothing other
than club box does it is one server apt

331
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:52,400
206 if there is a new version download
it is probable

332
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,710
so if we had that server now suppose we
see that the Commission's a server

333
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,690
pretty interesting where they were

334
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:12,220
read rather call support so this is the
update server for all the devices server

335
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,910
if they were read right excuse I read
read right for everyone can imagine

336
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:26,558
their division of the next 10 takes up
very take this officials you login and

337
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:38,200
also there was there's things that
checking the hasher's to check the

338
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:45,930
source of its Mexican migration of being
readable writable by any user so at that

339
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:52,720
point it seems pretty clear if all these
things and smoothly it's it's a unicorn

340
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:02,649
exploit 11 dogs and do it the way I look
at it was kinda like this

341
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:09,839
insert whatever you want so back two or
three packages and updated to a later

342
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,589
version so if you give it back on the
server is we have every right to

343
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:15,500
purchase

344
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,750
you need anybody to check for new
versions of this new version download

345
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:27,050
that upside to the bodies and from there
you just back to whatever device they

346
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:35,720
say at this point so what's really
interesting so its needs a lazy and they

347
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:43,569
investigated determined that you even
missions were actually correct but it

348
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:51,940
was actually so like jean Sixers and it
was displaying permissions rerun rerun

349
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:58,720
the next screenshot showing that the
server that was running a Windows it was

350
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,390
not retried it was administered so there
is using those when you first look at it

351
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:10,830
remotely you know you really don't know
what are you just as soon as abstract

352
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,520
but you know this beautiful dug into
turning into

353
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,120
which is free for end users devices are
back to work anymore

354
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,990
richly lot of thought they're actually
safer to go through missions supposedly

355
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:30,419
told and showed three times so I can
pretty much believe I guess that it was

356
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:37,960
actually ok permission so I guess it was
hard to verify that because I don't own

357
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,350
a server I don't wanna obviously don't
try to avoid a legal round of bond at

358
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:50,029
least it's actually really tested and
even if I don't know the actual

359
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:56,800
emissions they have on their server to
test those are super dumb ass i dont

360
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,040
have reached in cases where you haven't
really tested because it is there

361
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,640
someone else's environment on their
machine on their infrastructure so even

362
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,960
if you've been replicated everything
even if you replicate that the server

363
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:19,470
and all that settlement for sure what do
you should measures are so they weren't

364
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:25,259
they didn't seem pretty weak commission
checks they get the shot one inside but

365
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:32,850
one which is the the image and another
which keep the houses of the image of

366
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:41,319
the rice so they're able to just insert
a new hash in the hallways are changing

367
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,880
more so the way it was checking it was a
really bad way so very best security

368
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:54,730
from the internet integrity checks ones
so after all this they came out with a

369
00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:00,890
security update and add a major security
fix or not cos other day they really did

370
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,339
my work to do

371
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,960
Bank of not been that was that today
we're aware of all the stuff that takes

372
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:16,780
a lot of issues reaching out wise trees
device vendors has been a lot of blog

373
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:25,260
posts they got released for Western
Digital or taking it much devices just

374
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,350
barely would not work with them without
patches

375
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:34,310
chance of precip there's no security
those email addresses from the Euphrates

376
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:42,860
vendors everything is just to get there
I never saw him by users and this could

377
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:50,430
change but never seen by the public
advisors thanks that's in yesterday's

378
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,520
release notes for auto rental security
fixes problems

379
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:02,930
security fix but downplayed no working
now the vendors so you gonna tell you're

380
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:11,649
interested in how they handle them and
my friend Christopher Columbus's shows

381
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:18,860
how to do this so Seagate reported back
in January really weird response of

382
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,430
course there tell me what a crazy like a

383
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,470
devices were psyched about shell shocked
if they do worry admitting to do itself

384
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:36,609
but I wasn't there to fall response to
you need security and government 62

385
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,260
released this system where your serial
number and not really public and other

386
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,940
things

387
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:49,550
but slowly released exist for this video
was actually pretty bad but just the

388
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:56,680
weird process of the secret key and not
really I went over to say direct line

389
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,520
but it was pretty basic tactics for
answering my questions but they

390
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:15,310
eventually 60 bucks with them yesterday
reported back in January no response to

391
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:20,500
search for help they were helpful
sometimes but I could even think from

392
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:30,980
the meter so we disclose all this back
in June numerous governments and their

393
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:39,380
support forms you know that a yes or
anybody else security on here for some

394
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,190
bugs a bunch of different times and even
the people in the consumers of

395
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:51,630
individuals as they were like they were
so I was being sarcastic funny really

396
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:57,200
just like I like three years of you just
gotta suck they never help with anything

397
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,230
whether their responses have been to
double stuff for a while

398
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:13,690
and it's got the most ago you must go
now they were unable to report them and

399
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:25,750
they fixed it exists I don't know for
sure just got to keep you from dog and

400
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,710
then they were talking about the
Commission's a soviet screenshot I guess

401
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,359
I believe that there's still goes
through secrecy issues even think about

402
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:46,130
that is not a different plane and then
today releasing on the conclusion is it

403
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:52,700
really all doom and gloom oh yeah very
bad there's not really a clear path

404
00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:02,500
forward either there's no security
devices even Apple Google software

405
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:10,369
companies or wherever they want to go
down there doing taking a huge step back

406
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:18,350
compared to the process is the other big
US which should be a skirt but

407
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:24,910
they could be better than this
certification in your network as soon as

408
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:33,660
I don't have any expectations for
security because they are you could

409
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:41,250
really use these devices such as much
freedom and just don't want people to do

410
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:53,470
that just around the corner at the best
spending the money for the software so

411
00:44:53,470 --> 00:45:03,899
you could do that reduces don't consider
very bad security news they can only

412
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,920
have helped us there's no emails like
they think they've literally eradicated

413
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,800
that strategy whatsoever just don't do
emails

414
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,500
to talk to an email there's no public
emails and is looking for people who

415
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:26,150
work for the company to get their first
email addresses to the gym buddies but

416
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:32,960
it's a lot of time spent so much time
wasted so much time people down to look

417
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:45,130
for answers so I don't trust not ready
for any kind of security in the cloud in

418
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:53,550
general in general there's just a
marketing secrets secrets anymore

419
00:45:53,550 --> 00:46:02,640
questions before russians Commission
earlier devise a tent for the best

420
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,049
question I would give it to you it is
basically brand new display the data for

421
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:14,430
security not back toward nothing like
that we really did my analysis resisted

422
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,390
pressure to go if nothing else it's a
brick or sixty whichever one you prefer

423
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:27,670
so ask questions to determine what the
best one is the first one back there

424
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:41,589
oh ok that one ok I've heard of the
company I have not I didn't work either

425
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:48,259
side of it but it looks based on that
they are remodeling company serves our

426
00:46:48,260 --> 00:47:16,970
devices and other do not know ok yes

427
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:31,240
reactions from street so maybe it was
just the model numbers look at it but

428
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,279
it's worth noting that on the web

429
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,940
you're looking for them if they're
suppose the Internet to their web

430
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,849
interface sure you do in that class of
investors you can do to search likes

431
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:50,280
over a bus stop he dresses for a Western
Digital My crowd or something like that

432
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,130
prices and the bugs that are in these
are probably shared throw of the other

433
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:02,010
devices and for our district or the
strings like their device name of the

434
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:37,780
device models of the jockey range

435
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:57,410
I would but that would be surprised if
you're able to legitimately just like to

436
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:03,430
get I'm a similar system remotely
control the device so dont txt point of

437
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,080
attack for your going out to the boxes
during a clear shot from the provider to

438
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:35,000
the device had a question yes

439
00:49:35,000 --> 00:50:19,240
into Windows computer Linux or whatever
and sharing of their third of their

440
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,700
signature personal stories to me you're
relying on you know the Windows or Linux

441
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,879
Texas controls which are much more
better than much more things so that

442
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,510
would be my solution I did that was for
people to mention they were really free

443
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,820
enterprise but these situations where
you know your words you're like on the

444
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:44,460
bus tours yes add me into bayous and
shared drive and she doesn't and/or yes

445
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,440
and service area like that so they can
turn into this thing where if you're

446
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,250
bitter red teaming a software company
like Nigeria 0 signed a ton of just

447
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,890
external hard drives or shares out there
and I don't know if they're going to use

448
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:05,270
Western Digital Sound Devices they may
just be you know sharing the hard drive

449
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:12,259
yeah that's the scenario where might be
relevant but I'll just share but then

450
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:18,090
you don't you know don't stop things
like that I guess I'll just live without

451
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,080
computers

452
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:34,430
there's no really good security solution
at this point forward

453
00:51:34,430 --> 00:52:09,690
but at least you know what they were
called extend their word you don't have

454
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,859
to wait six months for them to never
respond two years ago that I had to go

455
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:20,619
into the system upgrades for me
personally most secure way to your

456
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:24,160
computer and share and configure the
Commission securely would be scared of

457
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:48,779
course

458
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:59,010
actually have a USB port on the side so
you can put it even more stores like 60

459
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:04,630
about why you don't do that but I do
have teachers so you could you could

460
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:10,230
probably have used before she could even
change the Libyan security came with a

461
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:15,220
cause of ice with around her and yet you
seen you if you didn't turn out last

462
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:20,439
year we see these routers well he's
crazy back doors and things like that

463
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,700
there's been a lot recently and
throughout the year so I think I guess

464
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,910
the router vendors have had a lot more
time to see the effects of the

465
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:35,259
insecurities having their devices and it
didn't work she would be me and you

466
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:45,380
still not as much so that I guess
because he was initially CCA everyone's

467
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,310
been driving using hard drugs for years
I've been using it since I was a kid you

468
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,770
know today is a new day dropping bombs
so now they're transitioning to devices

469
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:03,470
which is different concepts like this is
a story of course but I do but I would

470
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:19,359
just security it's actually better but
but not much else to say

471
00:54:19,360 --> 00:55:33,619
so yes

472
00:55:33,619 --> 00:56:08,890
thank you very much
