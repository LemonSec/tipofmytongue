1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,410
if you don't you guys it early in the
presentation will be a presentation but

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,410
it'd be helpful to be able to look at it

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:31,650
yeah

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,440
any point you can be very soft-spoken

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,159
I get a lot of you can you repeat that
just try to speak up a little bit

6
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,289
once they're out with a few questions
how many of you in here right now

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,289
our analyst

8
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,949
how many are managers are executives

9
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:12,539
ok what are the rest of you who don't
know just here to learn this admin

10
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,780
ok so now we're guys either

11
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,530
how many of you in here at work guys
okay that's good

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,640
ok everybody

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,640
how many of you in here familiar with
network slow

14
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,600
woman i come from a certain vision of a
software engineering Institute at

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,100
Carnegie Mellon University

16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,910
I'm a research analyst on this situation
where his team yesterday did some

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:00,800
presentations on defining events which i
call it caters description vs deviation

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,270
vs. disrepute

19
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,240
today I'm going to talk about networking
is but i'm going to give a little bit of

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,190
a very overview what I presented
yesterday because this ties into it

21
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,900
just several people in the audience

22
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,770
background because

23
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,380
so what is this - here event as an
analyst of your security event is a

24
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,690
series of actions rather go across some
number of assets where at least one of

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,300
those actions adversely impacts your
asset adverse impact is based on your

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,210
organization . because not all
organizations use the same offense as

27
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,100
bad as other organizations for instance
not organizations you scanning is bad

28
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:05,730
you like what do I actually mean by this
is where your pictures going

29
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,870
sample is it events

30
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,670
coll SCH brute force account so we're
going to say that the organization has

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,630
its decided that brute force attempt
their mind security event

32
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,609
what I mean by you haven't seen the
event is actually a series of actions

33
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,890
you can break down what happens in this
hm brute force attempt

34
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,500
based on what happens in your network
where you actually see different parts

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,690
of the girl back

36
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,579
so if we define an ssh brute force
attempt and definition is very important

37
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,270
for you as we have to know exactly what
you're looking for so we know where to

38
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,110
look for it

39
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:59,530
we can say that we have actions such as
a remote communication goes across the

40
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,940
router through a firewall to the ssh
server so you can see that you have

41
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:13,960
several actions there you have the
remote actor initiate communication from

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,880
their device the router forwarded that
communication to the firewall firewall

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,360
process it forwarded to the router on to
the ssh server then the ssh server

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,210
process whatever it received in this
case it would been pumped for login

45
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,359
information and go back through the
router which will forward it to the

46
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,310
firewall which would form into the other
router back to wherever the original

47
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,820
originated for the login time somebody's
then going to send the login information

48
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,150
back through the same or a different
path but it's gonna go through the

49
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,169
routers of this is your landscape is
going to go through a router firewall

50
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,280
and router

51
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,679
never you're going to get the film
attempt because it's a brute force

52
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,090
successful first try to repeat some
number times

53
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,030
that's what i mean by that is really a
series of actions that occur across some

54
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,030
assets at specific locations

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,469
yes that's okay

56
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,969
that would be that would definitely make
sense

57
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,748
yes but when I really mean that

58
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:46,439
off the bat you consider the security
event but yes those are still things

59
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,439
that are of interest

60
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,360
any other questions about that feel free
to interrupt me if you want more details

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,360
or just discuss it

62
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,880
so is asked in context we've been
hunting

63
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,390
so when something we're trying to find
something that we suspect may have

64
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,820
occurred at work or in our environment
but we don't really have any alert were

65
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,420
visible indication yet that it actually
hasn't heard

66
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,210
so I think about the concept of course
that process we think about the effects

67
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,560
that we really want to find that we're
going to go hunting for we can find

68
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,780
those events based on the actions like I
just explained with the ssh course we

69
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,109
write the actions and about where those
would occur in our landscape we think

70
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,090
about those individual actions and think
about legitimate causes for any of those

71
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,530
in particular actions

72
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,000
so the network communications going to
the router through the firewall router

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,580
again you see that all over the place

74
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,599
so there's a lot of legitimate causes
for those actions for an adverse event

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,530
at least one of those actions probably
not going to be likely to have legend

76
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:22,400
causes and the state's workforce example
the fact that you had 20-plus valid

77
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,229
attempts going back

78
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,970
ssh server that somebody is about to
login isn't likely to have legitimate

79
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,250
cause most people will stop

80
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,600
maybe if you're lucky they'll try to ten
tries

81
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,470
usually after a while they are going to
call my team why can't i login

82
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,090
so when you're hunting if you thought
what you're actually you're gonna start

83
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,429
action likely to have a legitimate cause
because that's how are you going to do

84
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,550
that's fine he repents without a lot of
false positives

85
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,280
questions so far vacation

86
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,719
so what we're doing is what we really
help to find the golden it

87
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,229
whatever we're looking for

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,860
unfortunately we don't always get this
far because we have to look for

89
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,990
indications of the actions as an analyst
it has network people security

90
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,780
advantages we can actually see actions

91
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,039
I'm like in the physical world where we
are going to see fingerprints or

92
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,819
footprints or problems for some cake

93
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,740
we don't see that cyber world we have to
have something that captures the actions

94
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,089
that can really the information

95
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:50,529
this action card back us this occurs
once for logging sensing a fortune

96
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,270
don't only catch her illegitimate
happening they also capture which impact

97
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,970
you have an application log set up to
log in log in action

98
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:10,930
anytime somebody logs in you're going to
have both legitimate logins log in the

99
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,239
legitimate traffic in most cases greatly
outnumber 'he's whatever you looking for

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,110
and if you can put them something
specific anything you don't want to find

101
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:27,220
within the structure is basically always
in your view

102
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,990
one of the reasons it's true it's
because we often want to find actions or

103
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,769
look for in either indirectly because we
can't you don't have the logs where the

104
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,230
actual actions that were interested
occur

105
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,819
so for instance with the ssh server
example we may not have an ssh server

106
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:56,279
log that can tell us how many time that
there were no login attempts it back to

107
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,300
the same IP address if you do great i
hope you do

108
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,189
but if you don't have to look for
something that would imply that action

109
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:14,040
elsewhere application is not only not
exact match for the actual application

110
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:30,750
so this workshop during out noise with
our flow but the general concepts would

111
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,170
be applicable to the source

112
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,140
we have to define different types of
ways that would occur

113
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,140
so what exactly is noise

114
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,180
it's anything that's extremely srl your
relevant to what you need

115
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:57,000
that is the data looking for an event
especially security when you have logs

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,570
that are different detail loves it don't
have as much information are going to

117
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,190
have more noise because it's harder to
discriminate between what the actions

118
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,100
that the log is representing the
countries representing so for thinking

119
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,269
about network

120
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,470
we have many different levels of detail
we have a full packet capture from

121
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,120
wireshark example where you actually get
the full replica of the packet of all

122
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,180
the packets not pass you're sending you
have network flow which is just a

123
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,739
summary specific lines of communication
those home with the praying levels of

124
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,850
detail themselves the most basic will
have something like the source IP

125
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,380
address this nation IP address source
port destination port start time

126
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,550
protocol

127
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,959
hopefully the number of bytes packets
that occurred specific communication

128
00:11:51,959 --> 00:12:02,339
today most network flow programs will
you have other details for instance pcp

129
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:10,860
flag in for me to code information and
even capture some HTTP field or ssh PP

130
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,199
filled those logs

131
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,069
you better ways of finding what you want

132
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,000
they also give you better ways

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,060
questions or comments just coming

134
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:33,349
if you one more books on the edges here

135
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,619
whether you're finding the events
themselves or the noise definition is

136
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,760
very important

137
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,310
most people think about defining anomaly
detection signatures

138
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,529
I like to think of it more as a matrix
where we have description disrepute rose

139
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,740
and whether you're looking for some
action

140
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,930
for some unknown action as columns
description corresponds roughly to a

141
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,949
signature

142
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,750
if you're looking for No description
you're going to your description is

143
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:17,060
gonna be bad attributes deviation so
description involves attributes involves

144
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,869
measurement district you revolves
involves identity creation would be some

145
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,130
specific page and trends for example if
you suspect an empty TP distributor of

146
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,360
service attack education would be some
incoming vol two outgoing volume or

147
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:49,100
theme outgoing volume 55 times that
would be a definition of action for your

148
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,770
dogs for disrepute if you don't know
distribute this is you're blacklisted

149
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,220
idea that identities

150
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,660
you're right list idea would be
distributed to set up

151
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,439
no good identities if you're not in the
identities you're going to be suspect

152
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,089
where you're going to be of interest

153
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:13,310
an unknown deviation would be used to
use some sort of profiling you get and I

154
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,099
general idea of what is happening on a
specific device or our service men in

155
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,390
general you track that over time or
against and or against similar devices

156
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:36,010
that works and see if it changes . some
statistical variation or looking for

157
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,840
if you're looking for an unknown
description you have a no good

158
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,330
attributes that is not good attributes
that would be suspect example this would

159
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,320
be if you have a dns server and select
all communications to be over the DNA

160
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,250
report

161
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,610
well if you see communications port 53
description

162
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,100
any questions on this many do you go
into more detail go over it again

163
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,130
so whether you're doing events or you
can use this method definition to

164
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:27,990
actually want to find something that you
pull out of the data or throw network

165
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,020
noise if we're looking at network noise
we want to find something that

166
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:39,600
discriminate below from what is of
interest and usually assistance ,

167
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,330
traffic types press and scanning

168
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,440
if you're looking for an event that
isn't scanning and identify that is

169
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,200
pretty killer set up network traffic
relates to scanning you throw it away

170
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,310
from the rest of your analysis
backscatter proxy traffic and then

171
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,010
probably some content services and
applications

172
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,660
maybe if you're looking for specific
goes over tcp you could throw away

173
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,380
anything

174
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,189
p or q c TZ icmp same thing with
services if you're looking for something

175
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,850
that is specific to the NS you can throw
away anything

176
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:28,080
web certain internal devices capable of
being the same thing

177
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,520
mr. addresses

178
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,670
these are all places where you can start
to start out in your dad to so that

179
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:44,900
actually go to look for your events you
have less likely it is likely to be

180
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,900
false positives

181
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,230
very definition so I talked about the
actions or events

182
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:09,559
so what I want to do for the workshop
take those no types of data types of

183
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:15,170
traffic common types of traffic and
think about how we would be fine with me

184
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,729
network flow so that we could filter
them out let me go for analytics

185
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,099
I don't have actual work clothes this is
conceptual exercise

186
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,450
yes

187
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,850
home

188
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,639
so the class is pretty bad but we'll try
the first one together

189
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,619
yes we can break up into groups if that
doesn't work out too well

190
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:05,049
so before we can do any definition we
have to know what we have to work with

191
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:09,099
because if we find an action we have to
be able to find the action based on the

192
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:12,908
characteristics and fills that we can
see directly or compute

193
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,099
so for network logo will seem that we
have some very basic network flow fields

194
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:22,839
we have a source and destination IP his
if you're looking at your workbook this

195
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:29,889
is on me - 5:00 sharp source and
destination ports you protocols packets

196
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:41,709
fights start time and duration icmp code
initial session pcp Laxus so with TCP

197
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,429
flags

198
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:48,820
the first packet that is sent what we
have with that would be initially flags

199
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:53,320
anything else this session will be in
session so aggravated

200
00:18:54,129 --> 00:19:02,408
does that make sense i'm going to assume
that we have the directional flow

201
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:08,289
initiate a communication that is going
to be summarized in one flow field and

202
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,549
any response that whoever i'm
communicating with back is going to be

203
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:13,719
in a separate flow

204
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,679
there is another type of flow called my
directional flow where two would be best

205
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,149
together both methods have their
benefits and drawbacks

206
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,389
I think it's easier to look at
unidirectional flows from most pieces

207
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,428
because I do

208
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:36,940
definition that include a symmetrical
routing words in your server sent place

209
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,940
you can pull that out first versus what
you sent

210
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,870
we're going to assume that we have a
very simple network that we have set

211
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,649
your location

212
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,950
both routers make sure it's also on page
five

213
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:58,780
and that we are working with sample
sample vs now I'm simple if you have one

214
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:04,030
sample network flow every every
communication is going to be summarized

215
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,030
to one or more network close

216
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,060
if you have a sample rate two ways
sample give you different outputs you

217
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:20,620
can sample X number of packets per
thousand say one out of a hundred in

218
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,459
that case you're going to have you're
not going to have clothes for every

219
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,020
communication channel

220
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,050
nor are the clothes that you sample

221
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:37,389
are they going to have the data for the
whole flow you can sample network close

222
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,340
the whole flow in which case you will
get clothes that you see you will get

223
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,449
complete but you will not be able to see
all communications from you security

224
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:53,050
perspective this is not very helpful
because you are his visibility into a

225
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,090
very large portion of the communications
from the network performance

226
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:06,010
it doesn't simply can still problems
question before

227
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,519
yeah

228
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,059
you're just repeat for the recording

229
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,429
test your flow versus comprehensive you
only found one

230
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,580
events with sample vs comprehensive
analysis

231
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,490
ok so when we create our definitions
we're going to flow fields we can

232
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,710
specific values or ranges for any of
those particular fields we can do is

233
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,320
holding ranges or aggregates piece on
the field that we have and we can also

234
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,000
use your location

235
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,389
what are you

236
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:34,258
so the first thing that I would like to
work funny is being so first thing we

237
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,629
need to do is define what is scanning

238
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:40,708
so what are some of the types of pants
that you might see in your network to

239
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:50,519
classify as for instance there are many
different types of scans like ports can

240
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:59,729
never see anything that you can bring
further since can or you can break it

241
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:02,099
down to christmas tree scan

242
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,019
so what for this workshop what would you
like to do

243
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,410
yeah

244
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:36,309
ok do you have an example

245
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,870
correct

246
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,710
ok so do we

247
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:15,260
ok foreskin 22 ok so you want to scan if
we think about that scan

248
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,000
what are some of the characteristics
first of all with the actions of her

249
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,400
if you look at our network person that
something is going to do is well have a

250
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,840
physical person actor who initiates
which creates a stream that goes through

251
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,000
your router to your firewall to your
first instance the scan through and do

252
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,820
some IP address on 422

253
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,330
it's the first time the person's actions
and that's repeated multiple times two

254
00:24:53,330 --> 00:25:01,189
different destination IP addresses but
the same for about how many times to be

255
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,930
what happened

256
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,060
do we want so what it creates a
threshold because happens once

257
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,070
okay that could be it how about

258
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,780
so what would be what we want to use as
a threshold that if it happened at least

259
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,780
x times

260
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,410
ok so it's going

261
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:44,630
multiple IP addresses could use that
number times or what else is doing

262
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:53,240
we could say that he's touched at least
50 different IP addresses the same

263
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,250
destination port we could say that is
our definition or we could say that yes

264
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,170
touch with the addresses destination
port but anything else

265
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,090
yes

266
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,990
ok

267
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,799
ok Oh

268
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,700
ok so we can go with that so the
characteristic would be the same

269
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:31,450
external IP address is hitting five or
more internal IP addresses for 22

270
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,960
yes to do question

271
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,619
sorry

272
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,019
so it could be not necessarily the same
source IP address it could be something

273
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,019
that just once in a very close by saying

274
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:09,428
ok so that would be a description
definition and that would help us

275
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:17,950
filter out one time scanning it's fairly
simple to find scanning at that level

276
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:25,509
sometimes you request so can you define
sketched and so is there something that

277
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:30,700
you can say that maybe we don't care
just about age maybe we just want to say

278
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,359
all this is scanning their way to define
early

279
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,840
yes

280
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:06,938
yeah it is very hard to find skin
generically if I usually just set it

281
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:18,759
external IP has a connection to a
thousand plus and I proxy server list

282
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:30,969
that's probably about it so . which is
defined events different levels

283
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,839
the more detailed you get a more
accurate

284
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:45,959
sure you are going you are actually
getting what you're looking for if you

285
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,760
go with something more generic you're
going to increase your rate of false

286
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,810
positives

287
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:58,409
all right what I'm doing scanning if I
want to just skin because i want to fill

288
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:04,740
a large portion of my day . i usually
breaks to network port scan now we're

289
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:13,860
scanning one external IP address a to
multiple internal IP addresses for scans

290
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:24,360
when you have one external IP address to
multiple ports

291
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:41,540
you want to group discussion would you
like to break up in groups to discuss

292
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,540
the other

293
00:29:48,169 --> 00:30:00,649
continue group ok so backscatter going
on outside your organization and your

294
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:09,918
organization IP addresses are causing
replies being sent from the attacker to

295
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,070
be sent back to your IP addresses

296
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:21,499
what you will see with backscatter is
that a lot of the backscatter what - he

297
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:27,739
addresses the organization network block
but only some of those addresses are

298
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:31,100
actually assigned to active devices at
any one time

299
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:37,759
you know when you start seeing a lot of
traffic to inactive ip's that either

300
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,759
scan is going on here

301
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,409
anybody get some ideas how to
differentiate the two

302
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,179
yeah

303
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,530
miles

304
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,100
one of the biggest part differentiations
between backscatter and scanning is most

305
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,480
scans look like session

306
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,660
initiations whereas backscatter
responses theory you can scan with

307
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,790
responses but practice that's not so
that would be one way to differentiate

308
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:57,409
between the two there's two different
types backscatter two different types

309
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:06,140
but the two most common result from
attacks or skip dots attacks and spam

310
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,140
email would be differentiated between
the two

311
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:25,240
with you probably see a larger volume
traffic be set back that he would email

312
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,730
but I don't want to differentiate
between the two but we could if you want

313
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,350
to their way

314
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,129
you probably think about what how

315
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,350
so based on the flow what would but what
we want what are the characteristics or

316
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,939
aggregates thresholds

317
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,940
we want to see

318
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:22,960
we start looking at pcp backscatter
we're looking for responses flag so

319
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,910
close

320
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,370
don't have what we want incoming or
outgoing

321
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:48,199
we have incoming flows where the flag is
act probably also say there is not a

322
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,679
corresponding outgoing flow the flag

323
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,010
so you want to do relation

324
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,710
can we say anything about back its
rights

325
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:17,710
so packets at least one packet obviously
probably not necessarily about this but

326
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,429
with whites

327
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:27,639
you're probably gonna have some
information so he bites x probably

328
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,639
response so much

329
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,679
it's just the second part of a handshake

330
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,830
we're gonna know anything about the
courts

331
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,989
yeah

332
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,980
ok

333
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,320
so the other so that's the question they
see a lot of backscatter the results

334
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,190
from bittorrent which packets as anybody
else

335
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:11,750
I Institute Inc

336
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,980
can we see something about the
backscatter what specific protocols

337
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:36,759
probably when you probably want to stick
with you

338
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:45,700
pcp possibly ip66 balls

339
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,399
we're gonna probably have a pretty short
duration close

340
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,359
scatter

341
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:12,600
what we expect to see session blacks
response flag with Jack would we expect

342
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,509
to see any session flags

343
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:22,170
probably not because you would expect
your firewall

344
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:33,840
whatever he said session actually for
the destination IP addresses for

345
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:49,710
backscatter you're going to see most
active active active or in inactive

346
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,640
actually it was only hitting active
lucky space

347
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,868
flow characteristics

348
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:14,349
what is there anything that we want to
actually happen X number of times or

349
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:17,349
with X number

350
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,990
right

351
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:54,910
so for us attack the source that can
address the water flows so that case

352
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,810
you're going to threshold for spam email

353
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:10,360
he is going to probably actually 14 span
backscatter necessarily you might but

354
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,470
it's gonna be a lot harder to actually
go out as noise as opposed to anything

355
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:24,669
else you can actually probably gonna see
more instances individual source IP that

356
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,920
have multiple flow single source

357
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,910
yeah

358
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:44,509
people

359
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,990
yes

360
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:34,680
that's a lot of times we initially
defined as useful for actual analysis

361
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,299
so sometimes it is very helpful to
actually look at the backscatter see you

362
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:43,709
want any patterns threat

363
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:49,649
listen or does it give me some idea
we're going to use the information

364
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,779
within it to give me some idea

365
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,249
well these are the targets and these are
characteristics of the targets

366
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,249
do I have anything

367
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:11,189
something that also computer useful
thinking about noise or even events .

368
00:41:11,189 --> 00:41:12,959
external information

369
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:22,979
so for that scatter especially with
scanning there are some help you

370
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,558
identified back together

371
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:35,670
sometimes you can find that will show
that these places are attack in which

372
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:46,949
case you find the addresses of
experience with using external data

373
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:54,179
segments or to give some to you

374
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,180
external information to inform their
definitions

375
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,510
yeah

376
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:49,750
best to hear that the rest and makes it
decreases the common traffic not likely

377
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,330
to be interesting for a specific event
especially security event

378
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:06,700
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to determine , is so what would start

379
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,669
with an example would be here is
legitimate request make up a huge

380
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,170
internal probably closed

381
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,770
% yes

382
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:33,250
so I can filter out those requests that
it also cuts down my analysis into about

383
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:42,130
how so if I were to define a legitimate
DNS request and response traffic

384
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,130
how would I start what are some of the
characteristics

385
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,140
yes I would start by profiling server

386
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:09,540
SI size of the response probably the
request to be outside and your usual

387
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,480
range

388
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
what else would I want to do

389
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:26,220
so we're thinking about network flow you
can actually use the workflow cancer

390
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:34,620
over some of your time you want to do
periodic updates some traffic do some

391
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:42,420
statistical calculations so let's assume
done that

392
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:56,640
thresholds are that request should be
with somebody package packets so if you

393
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,620
want to actually filter that out

394
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,569
network traffic what are some of the
other characteristics around for the

395
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,920
individual flows

396
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
first thing first

397
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,029
453 right so we should have sort of a
destination

398
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,540
ok

399
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:39,640
so you do you determine whether its
source or destination your server

400
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:53,319
it's important to be 53 sources say what
protocol would want to use

401
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,780
yes

402
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,210
so we probably want to use ok entp to
cover our bases

403
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:20,650
unless you not specifically that your
organization which you would determine

404
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,420
by you're profiling uses only one or the
other and let's get here

405
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:38,029
if we're talking peace what we care
about with that your definition

406
00:46:48,520 --> 00:47:01,870
No description indicated probably
investigation so we don't expect

407
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:24,020
do we need to do is actually addressed
it using profiling

408
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:30,320
we could do another layer for filing see
what is the number of requests that

409
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:40,010
particular IP address comes first we'll
save you the address would do between

410
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:46,100
hundred that's not your ways

411
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:57,680
one other thing to be aware of with the
S is servers so if you have the

412
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,060
knowledge about where services are
supposed to do if you have an internal

413
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:10,100
dns server original maybe we're all your
internal clients are supposed to go

414
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,790
first

415
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:17,180
external you might want to include
you're always turn

416
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,160
let's go to some external is doing

417
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:31,880
other common traffic that we might be
able to say something about people

418
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:37,880
yes

419
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:57,440
you identify it compromised our external

420
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:14,320
traffic be identified

421
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:30,460
we think about it we can talk about
specific services

422
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,419
what does anybody here

423
00:49:49,420 --> 00:50:00,790
ok large fortune network traffic noise
when storage

424
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:26,280
but often but actually be the noisy
certain that you want to filter out if

425
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,050
you have a specific event in mind

426
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,160
so if you can identify CD IP space

427
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,549
you can filter out noise

428
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:40,740
yes I can you're sorry

429
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,870
yeah

430
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,350
yes

431
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:19,970
that would be that tends to be your
noise in your network

432
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,799
yeah you might actually want to do that
so you can use some way you have the

433
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,010
ability to identify where the source
actual physical location is you could

434
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:38,570
use that as a way to go yes yes

435
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:30,000
several people are actually the blogging
country which helped

436
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:24,670
so once your identifies with fake attack
trap check if you can filter out what

437
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:30,400
the rest of your tribe make you block it
helps reduce noise

438
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:34,359
you don't have to investigate

439
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,390
hopefully

440
00:54:45,839 --> 00:55:06,420
scanning we have outpaced country

441
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:19,229
- what are some other common types of
traffic that could that would be

442
00:55:19,229 --> 00:55:22,229
considered

443
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,510
from your analytics platform very good
thing too

444
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:41,340
yes google apps have you been successful

445
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:57,820
I p addresses that helps

446
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,910
yes

447
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:53,420
so if we can profile network and
identify common clients , servers

448
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:04,670
what we find is to getting if we know
what the blank would be on our server

449
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:14,690
filter out all the clients find all the
servers can also be informative for a

450
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,590
specific event

451
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,860
maybe our event has a definition

452
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,260
we're going to start acting like a
client or server

453
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:48,079
suggestions that proxy traffic

454
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:58,309
yes a lot of times we look at our to
have if we don't specifically no proxies

455
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:05,749
maybe you're going for whatever change
to recognize how do you determine what

456
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:17,808
data is related to your network boxes
simple if you know you're actually so

457
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:23,539
that you can filter that traffic into it

458
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:35,710
one way that worked for me

459
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:42,520
the case for scanning scanning look my
network boxes are always in there

460
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,970
because they're obviously connected to a
lot of internal IP address its

461
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:57,370
throughout the day usually only have one
sees but they actually have content

462
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:08,140
going through a lot of content or skinny
so apply my skating analytic then go

463
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:13,480
back and look through and see which of
these IP addresses that are within my IP

464
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,200
space actually have a lot of content

465
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,129
anybody who he is or suggestions

466
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,880
yes

467
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:12,859
nobody looks at you can identify if
something is behaving as a really good

468
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:17,670
yes

469
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:41,500
for my personal use tools

470
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:58,129
book because they developed

471
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,950
people

472
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:28,809
basically I just basically just some
sort of me and weighs like filter the

473
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:30,279
data to get what I want

474
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:33,279
processes

475
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,549
once you have the definition what do we
- Wow

476
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:55,700
whatever happens to be definitions and
hopefully we get this gold nuggets

477
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,750
we know it's not with the flow

478
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:05,089
if you do something similar with your
other logs definitions that are you can

479
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:08,150
see you actually get the gold nuggets

480
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:13,549
but usually you also have some flakes

481
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:18,170
so we actually do it

482
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:24,589
we are so probably going to have to do
some investigation

483
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:30,080
comments would like to discuss

484
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,880
anybody
