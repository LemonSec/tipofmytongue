1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,370
you can understand our lucien trends and
things like that then Jones my employer

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,259
would prefer that I don't see where I
work so seven and four sec for about

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,100
seven years and it's all my own work
it's something I've been doing for for

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:29,090
them to get more into the the defense of
things about three years ago there's

5
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:35,920
tons of families variants things change
every day so some of them are pretty

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,860
similar some of them are very different
you've got children that branch of the

7
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,899
parent you know you've got the city goon
grade kids relationships you've got

8
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,170
things that's happening and killed by
more success for kids and other

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,239
businesses it's really the business
model that wins out not necessarily the

10
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,390
technical expertise so you'll see you
know some

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,979
technically advanced x-ray hits the
theatres there are not as good at

12
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,179
marketing in their customer service so
hard to really understand what's the

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,060
most dangerous from a likelihood
perspective and then my real concern was

14
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,420
so so which ones are most most dangerous
for the organization and trying to

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,689
protect my family and friends you know
any better in the second row is out what

16
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,270
did it say such an understanding what's
going on in the world around us but it

17
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:41,270
was just text files were a bunch of
information on good sources of details

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,850
quickly became ineffective to find
intelligence that was that was good

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,329
about a source so inserting using things
like Evernote or meddle with you for a

20
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,939
little while we do if you could try and
figure out some stuff but even that

21
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,309
really didn't work well for
understanding relationships with the

22
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,670
continent

23
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:16,190
and that worked ok but a bunch of stuff
into MongoDB a dozen scrapers the RSS

24
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,840
feeds announcing further information
into MongoDB in violence an awesome

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,470
database it would really work well for
understanding the relationships and

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,370
trends so it's looking for Jay and I was
actually doing some exporting data from

27
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,850
Mon go into some mind mapping software
when I came across New Yorker J and what

28
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,620
time is it based on like a relational
database which is a horrible

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,830
relationships

30
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,069
database actually works really well
everything is interconnected by a sexual

31
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,880
relationship and at the root of the you
have notes and relationship and it's

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,280
really easy to visualize the
similarities and the differences between

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,040
things because it's it's a very a
graphical representation of a

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,750
relationship so the data storage is
really flexible you don't have to set up

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,280
a meeting beforehand to find keys on the
fly if you want to define the

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,260
relationship types and labels as
reporting data and the results are

37
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,620
immediately parents as soon as you agree
that when I was my initial none of this

38
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,019
was really easy to see the net effect
relationships of every building in with

39
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:41,549
a better read a contextual data to
relationships exist and it made it

40
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,780
easier to understand and especially to
describe how it relates to people when

41
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,400
you can just envision typically that's a
really good way to to help people see

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,280
what you're seeing mentally so the
language that uses as a decreasing tax

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,860
code safer and really big so that you
can get the most out of

44
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,600
1 I'm gonna show you the site I really
quick and it's very simple you have the

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,798
new edition for a given node so you're
you're gonna see in there

46
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:34,679
the second bullet and then the noted the
label for a given node so we're gonna

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,880
take us back to object oriented
development type stuff

48
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,780
the end is your stance is giving him for
that and then there would be more of a

49
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,750
class and then you can add a cure you
see I've got a name which Scott

50
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,470
something and other day though which has
been appointed it so we can add

51
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,320
attributes to a given node we do the
same thing for relationships are here

52
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,700
you see in brackets relationship
notation which is the alias for their

53
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,020
relationship as well as a label for that
type of relationship called related to

54
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,770
and then we've got two different aliases
for the two nodes so say that in the end

55
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,099
the relationship that we're seeing here
and you can also add I don't do it but

56
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,820
you can add attributes to a relationship
as well so you can say the first time

57
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:34,210
that this relationship was seen our last
time it was so much similar to the

58
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,700
selected segal gonna tell it what types
of knows they're looking for and we also

59
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,610
aware which is similar to Aaron sequel
which lets us refine the query to

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,850
specific text data points and
authorities say was returned so you see

61
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,250
in this example matching note in
something where it's related to know too

62
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,310
and they were telling it to return and
one into the scanner turn all nodes that

63
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,790
are related to a node name something we
can also read that differently with the

64
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,080
WHERE clause so there's a little bit of
flexibility in how you run your

65
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,699
your matches you need to use a note
whenever you're trying to use the

66
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,909
function fighter to his friends with you
when you write checks match or $0.22

67
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:33,259
scaling re trying to get genuine did it
once if you wanna cast cast an injury as

68
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:41,159
a sprain or strain injury but its forces
outside her window that is basically

69
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,900
site sequel meet a skier everything you
can do on a whiteboard you can pretty

70
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:55,219
easily turn into a secretary so yeah
just a note about the demo I am in until

71
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,810
they build those relationships off of
there is some trusted information

72
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,199
sharing groups of men and so a lot of
the day that I'm presenting the only

73
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,240
time presenting as anything that had a
URL in it so a lot of my Intel sources

74
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,169
that I'm using one of the match so I
basically assume that that's available

75
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:23,280
on the internet then I can show here so
we get into a demo

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:37,109
used on the virginia launched the server
process it's gonna see a movie for you

77
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,880
to get here and you can also run from
the command line as well so we grabbed

78
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,740
our first ever Krieger and businessmen
show you around the different types of

79
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,590
data that i've gotten them what's not
working relationships if you click over

80
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,820
here it's a show you the different types
of labels and relationship labels that

81
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,409
are available so first we're gonna look
at some of its we had a different

82
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,890
services that may come across so we
didn't do things as well in the graph or

83
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:25,688
we can do minerals so you'll see some
different service types we also have

84
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:39,539
discretion away from a given type of
service delivery vectors so you may

85
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,949
receive through phishing email married
seven-term albert is compromised website

86
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:51,459
TDs things like that so we can look at a
relationship of those with this crew

87
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:58,209
here so basically saying is shown me a
delivery vector and the will call that

88
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:03,849
TV where service type is related to that
and I don't know necessarily what the

89
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,120
relationship label is using this type of
query will find that out here so you

90
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,879
will see that the web enables
advertising TDs as summarized websites

91
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:27,939
emails fishing in advance of these
things that I've added to our various

92
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:32,819
things like that the people here will
also see service so here's where

93
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:38,550
relating to the radio services webcam
Surveyor is theirs as we can see in this

94
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,579
together pretty easily

95
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,378
should do that but you can copy and
paste a lot of these together to kind of

96
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:52,300
build so you can take to smaller queries
that that work in and those together

97
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,019
into a big reason you're gonna see from
the service level down through because I

98
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:05,199
have used to be available to users as
gives me the web I now can I can come

99
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:13,128
across government websites advertising
because every move lol fishing looking

100
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:20,000
at relationships we can also vary based
on a label for that relationships about

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,970
10

102
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,389
is developing one I can simply to say
show me a relationship where someone

103
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:32,120
develop something that's gonna show here
a bunch of weekend information that I've

104
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,829
added about different comes through a
lot of research incorporated in here

105
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:43,109
you'll see Microsoft adult all these
things I stayed away from doing version

106
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:51,240
specifics because it gets really hard
and makes it kinda hard to see any way

107
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,649
we can see that relationship you're the
one downside to doing a query where

108
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,250
you're going on the relationship label
as if you go back into your windows

109
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,300
you'll see I don't have anything about
my notes on it has details about my

110
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,599
relationships and empty because i dont
have any attributes associated with

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,129
those relationships so I tried to
rewrite those using note very specific

112
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:19,800
information so we run the same query was
just a functionally the exact same thing

113
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,699
is now I want to export information to
take some action got attributes about my

114
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:32,120
notes that are related and how they're
related so information have therefore

115
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,970
credit share it to a computer so you
just another analytics and some other

116
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:47,259
information as I started looking at the
motive doesn't work let's go to start

117
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,420
looking into it as well

118
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,309
payloads and then how they deliver to
get into a lot of a cool city ranked

119
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:00,819
second and we can also say another thing
we can do about a relationship in this

120
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:06,209
area I'm saying show me and then I don't
know that silly the label and I don't

121
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:11,069
know what the notice but she's
everything that's anything that's not

122
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:15,809
related to or one player in a
relationship further that show me

123
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,160
anything related to motive

124
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:26,050
and what the limits here is that we have
motives and we have payloads and so

125
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,229
you'll see you know we in this is just
Scopus the information available medical

126
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:37,689
information on this but started to
cleanly but it will see you know we're

127
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,550
worried about to take a regular basis

128
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,910
leaving behind a remote access Trojan or
something like that we have your classic

129
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,139
bank account takeover stuff so you're
next day or study was Eva things like

130
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:58,220
that guy is your everyone's favorite now
the script a wall in and that's the crip

131
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,790
stuff that's good example of a career
where I mean I know how things go

132
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,180
related and i was gonna do some
exploration of how these things become

133
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:15,258
related to your show you what we're
going over and have traded away from a

134
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,870
lot of the blog stuff to you at a better
person and playing with right now and

135
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:29,990
seems like there I get information
together a lot of information came from

136
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:42,189
but just different great blogs out there
so we can also look at here so you're

137
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,810
going to have this information is coming
from three hundred and twenty eight

138
00:13:46,810 --> 00:14:02,399
nodes all over the place look at his
exploits that are covered by that though

139
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,360
we've got some old stuff I got one
reference to black hole because it is a

140
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,580
variant of my call

141
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:24,730
what's up until about that time there
was no punches that is expected as we're

142
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,580
looking at how experts are related to
payloads and what Intel break out at

143
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,020
home so it's interesting for me to see
you know maybe I'm getting more

144
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,020
information about a specific Miller
family through through certain Intel

145
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,400
seeds so this is only showing the Intel
reports we have to take it out one step

146
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,490
further if you want to figure out who
the author of that is good to know you

147
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,690
know if I want to go back and figure out
already and i know i don't realize now

148
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,670
delivering to decrypt how to do when did
that happen we can look at that we can

149
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,589
look at the Rose here and I can start to
see right now in class now doing health

150
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:09,210
equipped and assorted scene at around
around the state's two min max type

151
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:17,870
analysis as well as we get in two days
later on the demo and you're going to

152
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,110
some fun stuff well we can certainly see
an accomplice prints on taking a little

153
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:38,060
longer to run a matching intel on both
sides of the gym to see similar similar

154
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,660
things so I get information about the
payload as well as the acts like it's

155
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,890
being used for the given payloads so
more good for a researcher less for

156
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,870
explaining to people outside but we can
start to see some friends here a lot of

157
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,050
wear and anger pretty comment it's
pretty common for delivering a lot of

158
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,109
the stuff as well as we're getting some
information from we can expect myself

159
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,880
even further

160
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:42,390
and we go back to earlier even go and
say

161
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:51,980
sixty people watching even worse

162
00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:02,090
helicopter now SunEdison awesome stuff
with covering engler and things like

163
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:10,530
that you can start to see a lot of room
just being relationships who can see

164
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,770
what we're gonna get certain information

165
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,290
redesigning its actually really really
interesting with Twitter and so I feel

166
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,319
that I was able to clean it up and get
that presented but the Twitter stuff

167
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,669
recall this American libraries other
actually they are willing to herself

168
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,890
into the other day that's just a good
example of how you can relate some Intel

169
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:39,990
sources into what you're saying what's
affecting your organization gets here we

170
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:46,780
can again words to say show me where
we're experts are being used against

171
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,220
certain venues better next week it's so
what's interesting here is if we start

172
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,970
to look at this crap and you can see
where you know it's gonna be tomorrow

173
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,950
that I can only pass for temple which
involves my worried about if we look

174
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,980
here you'll see right in the middle of
these are some Vietnamese 8 2010 at all

175
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,090
these UK is here all the machine very
similar exploits its offer me tells me

176
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,340
you know from a girl like that your
perspective the other meeting idk that's

177
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,689
gonna be excluded that's an exploit me I
want to make sure that I got these

178
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,630
things matched the spelling of that
relationship now because this is a silly

179
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,790
things have been reported that exceeds
an Intel feeds it doesn't mean they're

180
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,240
not using other things but it's a good
way to go to somebody will actually

181
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,150
start relating the software that's a big
way to go to your organization so let's

182
00:18:39,150 --> 00:19:15,330
do that right here

183
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:22,860
he was gonna be if I was trying to drive
the campaign for some you know some

184
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,590
aggressive testing memorization things
like that but we can see here is at the

185
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,720
root of a lot of this we had some
problems and had some problems in the

186
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,580
middle of the six wickets and well maybe
you know three years ago when I walked

187
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,179
in with an Excel spreadsheet and said
here's all the exploits in the same

188
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,620
problem as some others residents better
with people when they can see a bunch of

189
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,669
errands what's really awesome is you
could load no results from your

190
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,190
vulnerability scanners and show us all
assets as well this type of diagram so

191
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,830
not only is it is a very active exploits
in the wild but here they have them and

192
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,439
then when you have so many traders or or
people that are simple for desktops and

193
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,860
workstations that have those phones they
don't like all these areas are getting

194
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,929
their turning their systems so great way
to tell the story in a way that people

195
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:23,480
may quickly understand it

196
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:34,730
basically looking for his show me where
someone's motivated to perform financial

197
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,370
situation and right now we're seeing a
lot through the trip to take malware

198
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,010
understand what I'm saying here is shown
me where the Sun is motivated by

199
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:55,460
financial delivering a payload and then
for a different type of affected by this

200
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,730
one goes to the case so we're going in
and this is a really good example

201
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,700
serious fishing or something you know
why we have to catch him points because

202
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,110
they're worried about fishing or
whatever the motive you're concerned

203
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,149
with you could really use a paint a
picture of a reason to worry about these

204
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:23,680
things in that picture for you include
your coverage for what seems you have in

205
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,590
your ideas that are covering this
different signatures the same through

206
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:34,220
your protection software and things like
that

207
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:47,690
getting back to civilization and changes
we can scope this very make it even next

208
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,670
year so here I am looking at what time
was our first being targeted before with

209
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,840
everything that's ever been targeted by
those different exploit kits been

210
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,169
completed this year so what have we seen
this year my Twitter information has a

211
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,070
little bit more detail here because my
Michigan for now but it's just on what's

212
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,830
been published until sources I follow
you can see we've seen a significant

213
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,139
changes we look terrible based casino

214
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:34,870
drag / out here today sex and stuff for
certain things and the different UK is

215
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:41,270
that are better delivering different
types of different variants trip to

216
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:54,279
nowhere but if we change this to go back
to 2004

217
00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:09,399
abilities still here in the middle of a
lot of this and we really don't see dole

218
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:13,918
criticized couple of the last year so we
don't have a ton of stuff in there but

219
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:22,570
you can do some simple comparison and
see the differences earlier earlier so

220
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:31,658
we also scope this another way we can
say no classes known insecurities

221
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:40,450
friends here and here we go to to flash
specifically so kind of cool to be able

222
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:53,839
to dry out you know hey we've got this
really hard to see his specific advice

223
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:13,979
will be able to visualize a difference
here it's really hard to detect over we

224
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:22,289
can search by six problem areas for
Israel Iran and start to look again we

225
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:26,989
see that cluster here so we grabbed it
and what happens when you play with

226
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:32,419
class a little bit we'll start to see
some common things that all right where

227
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,629
everything is evolving out something we
can definitely see a cluster and that's

228
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:41,080
something that we can in such attacks on
dressing producer our overall tax

229
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:50,720
lately and I wasn't prepared to share
much of the details is really cool is

230
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,580
I've been going in analyzing and adding
attributes anime person system about

231
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:04,010
different sample data so here are some
days are 56 so the show similar samples

232
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,940
to play with different attributes so how
different pillows are using different

233
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,920
types of techniques to avoid detection
you can start to see some family

234
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,050
groupings occur there to your samples
and start to look at here until the

235
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:33,490
country these include permitting there
as well as you start to pull sample

236
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,200
information

237
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,430
really nothing to show the general
concept here of a power looking at

238
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,120
security problems from a different angle
can be valuable to the depending picture

239
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:53,320
for ourselves and people are trying to
help protect and this is really fun said

240
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,290
if allowed to kiss a dominating this
message returning shows everything but

241
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,800
what's really cool about this actually
is a kind of the root of a lot of our

242
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:11,240
problems she's a little bit but I think
people would have been able to tackle in

243
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:17,200
the OJ a lot of time on it but temporal
analysis so denies tracking evolution of

244
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,080
thing I learned is that change inside of
original there in the graph database is

245
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,689
really tough and there's no way to
petition any of this information and

246
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,640
other got it in there

247
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,760
requests for changes things like that
ton of themselves on other things that

248
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:47,040
you're gonna start to see you know
nuclear engler

249
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:56,970
training being a huge problem we've got
a little bit here and we've got the 10

250
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:03,650
colored stuff is the Intel information
and the answer here on the side

251
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,280
brown colored surface of our abilities
which have some significant grouping

252
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:18,180
that we look at everything from just
looking at our problems the whole nation

253
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:25,130
we will ensure that budget questions
about this is a concert or anything here

254
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:37,350
that have been trying to reach you on
Etsy to that

255
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:57,860
but she played with separate thread
became information from my friends

256
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:05,870
expand dumping the average and I guess
pretty interesting too so I don't have

257
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:14,719
any yet part of why I haven't started to
use it just about killed you load your

258
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,299
own ability data and here are some
things you could really start and then

259
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,350
start throwing some internal application
administrator information on their

260
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,770
people gonna stop trying to be in the
middle of a big bubble of problems so

261
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,960
might be a great way in an automated
fashion the beautiful thing about your

262
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,669
jus got arrested for everything
everything you can do in the community

263
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:40,590
can you feel rested so you can available
that's easily explainable to anybody

264
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:51,539
around a bunch of bubbles and energy
managers for a couple hours is

265
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,539
representing a lot of bombs knows it's
not a ton of dating here because it's

266
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:01,750
not agree with a great way to start a
bit I still got most of my nose a lot of

267
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:09,419
these are going to give in until report
is the using the title of the Intel

268
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,780
report as my primary key ID gathered
information on go to speak as much as

269
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,280
you can see a lot of that stuff a lot
better

270
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:26,580
but yeah

271
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:35,840
thanks for asking them to get to the
question was what was that look like so

272
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:44,730
publish everything I've been using some
restaurants and other stuff to have been

273
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,320
using some degree reveal every other
less he is everything that exported for

274
00:29:50,320 --> 00:30:00,250
today there's a Cy AP file which can be
read by the command line tool and here's

275
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,929
busy all your sexual stuff and so right
here I'm reading it from a CSV file to

276
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,409
go through and just do a global
substitution on path to wherever you

277
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:13,450
stick this stuff but it's gonna go
through an asthma pull out anything in

278
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,990
any of these is also be going here and
look at the input it's really simple so

279
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,149
like as a great list of bills that are
there and as we get into the

280
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:27,330
relationship here we're building an
expletive-filled relationship business

281
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:38,510
so I've got a really horrible to test
the web design is not my forte 1987 but

282
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:47,309
some code allows me to double other
stuff into a webcam in is a popular this

283
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:50,850
but at the end of the day it's usually
represented by CSV files of you and take

284
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,539
care of that for whatever it's worth
going told us when you get up and

285
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:01,460
running right away my horrible says it's
actually pretty good for me and I'm

286
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,630
pretty proud of this team is also
available in this grass fire which is a

287
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,380
way of color is a year and puts the
death of a little too is only a few

288
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,200
colors that it used box

289
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,659
so representations of here as well
because they don't come across in the

290
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:24,799
PDF it sent out and that all the queries
of Iran's today also to subpoena player

291
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:39,840
out of the recession really do so

292
00:31:39,840 --> 00:32:23,639
like I went back and started actually
maintaining all this on my own so they

293
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,570
can be interacting with the data and
again it's not been in possession of the

294
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,090
other day but it's a great way to kind
of wrap your head around things and

295
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,459
watch this the different evolutionary
trends of things and how these you know

296
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,640
what does this one article I just read
how does that fit in the bigger picture

297
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,149
of everything that's happening and
what's going on here so I the intended

298
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:50,469
for my my weapon operating with it as
intensely been men yeltsin kinda keep

299
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:56,080
close to the data but the one from
ongoing thing like that I got some more

300
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,730
stuff that used to come to mind a lot of
the stuff I'm going to consume me to do

301
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:08,679
things and that's what I'm reading based
on that so yeah but it's also not a

302
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:16,850
meteor as many as you want to be with
any other questions for lunch
