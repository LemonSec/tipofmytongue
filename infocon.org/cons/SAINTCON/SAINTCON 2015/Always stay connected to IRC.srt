to condense a twenty minute presentation

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,259
into 10 minutes and try and get you out
to lunch early still cuz that's my goal

3
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:38,430
to not make everyone wait to lunch this
really is going to be a super basic

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,510
introductory beginning IRC if you are
familiar with their see do not expect

5
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,620
there to be shattered and many things
that happen this is to get people in

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,680
talking and IRC so that you can
communicate with other people need to

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,820
see organization asked questions

13
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,750
had hoped and agencies in doing so we're
changing that if you have a project you

14

want help on coming down the HHV if you
wanna ideas for projects going on there

15

presentations every half hour to an hour

16
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,240

23
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,979
going on at such a program like slack if
you're familiar some of the web based

24
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,540
ones you go into a room you talk to
everybody there is a great way to share

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,250
information you just uses it to share
means 200 days

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,040
share to communicate with it I love it
because there's people all over the

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,739
state that I know to IRC that never met
somewhere else it's a great way to do

28
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,380
that

29
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,599

you learn so much by just talking to
girls but someone asked me about popular

44
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,109
IRC clients honestly there's a million
of them out there

45
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,650
download a few the popular ones and see
what you like sex chat works on

46
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,459
everything I have not heard people who
hate it unless their power users me

47
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,500
personally I use either side of the
console I like to do it but most of what

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:18,228
I do is text based anyways so I don't do
a lot with the GUI but a lot of people

49
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,789
like a deal for bitching because it's
what they use for the other is the

50
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,240
messaging a lot of people like if you
want a dedicated client access probably

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,090
the most popular models another popular
one that people like that hasn't ice

52
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,409
cream for you

53
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:41,340
yeah there's a million rather than tell
you about it I could spend a week

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,489
talking about those just google it look
at Edinburgh pages to which one looks

55
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,950
good try it out see if you like it can
handle but they're also there even one

56
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,830
of web based ones

57
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,190
fierstein etiquette it's this is
actually tested it happened a couple

58
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,450
weeks ago when I R see somebody was
doing somebody had their computer broken

59
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,120
and so they kept doing join the party to
tell you it so much joy and sorrow when

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,180
someone leaves around their computer is
broken and they were getting joins in

61
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,900
parts once a minute for about five days
and so we have a couple couple thousand

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,049
lines of this person entering and
leaving the chatroom comments were made

63
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,440
that were some people thought that they
were debatable sometimes they were

64
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,520
programs about their rude the person
left its kind of seemed like they were

65
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,370
disgusted by this sums up medicaid and
IRC is better than I've ever seen this

66
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,920
discussion it's hardly it is a hard
lesson where takes awhile but a

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,300
thumbs-up bed don't be a dick and have a
big step don't be offended when people

68
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,580
do things and try not to offend other
people that's that's some of it some

69
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,979
other things to think about

70
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,860
give other people the benefit of the
doubt were there to help you

71
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,410
almost everybody there wants to be
helpful generally being sarcastic not

72
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,230
being mean private if steps if you're
offended by something how else can I

73
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,650
interpret this what might he be trying
to sail rock star cast sarcasm might be

74
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,760
coming to their braces I'm not reading
the texts give people the benefit of the

75
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,370
doubt look for ways to interpret and God
be offended I mention the joint because

76
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,420
joining harding's watcher joins and
parts people get kind of bugged by those

77
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,480
that they have a doubt message of those
who may login

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,420
take private conversations about the
general channels leave the drawing at

79
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,520
the door and don't feed the trolls that
make it in standard netiquette there's

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,140
nothing shouldn't be anything fancy here
but I was being is flooding a lot of

81
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,890
times you have something you want to
share with everybody if I got ten lines

82
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,520
I wanna share if I am asking help a lot
of times roster help you got this config

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,680
file what do i do rather than basing 21
config file into the channel on talking

84
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,530
in I will open a new channel or go to
the flood channel but generally a new

85
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,710
general cold blood

86
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,130
go to their place all your stuff in
there so that you're not spending main

87
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:14,010
channel 31 big pile generally flooding
right War three or four lines of you

88
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,880
gonna do with the red face the channel
otherwise go somewhere else with it

89
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,159
another warning here watch what you say
but as far as I know there are no public

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,000
logs but you just a tire see server but
I know that I personally have about

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,980
three hundred and fifty thousand lines
of large from last five years on the

92
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,720
singer says there were people have this
stuff it can come back to bite you in

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,590
the butt so don't just calling good this
is a public communication forum don't

94
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,099
forget that watch what you say not say
no say anything it's very informal and

95
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,220
you can get away with saying a lot but
just know people have walked that these

96
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,889
are not on the web web searchable but
they do exist

97
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:08,009
a lot of links are shared a lot of the
links I would say 90% 95% elites are

98
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,460
safe for work and good to go and of the
five percent but are not safe for work

99
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,930
98 percent of those have not safe for
work Tech next to him every now and then

100
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,229
there's a wait but you should not look
at work that does not say don't look at

101
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,498
work so if you're concerned about that
don't like somebody and say hey whats

102
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:32,370
elite what's in that it sa their suckers
out there that quick whatever links put

103
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:40,510
before us and we'll tell you don't
usually so if your wanna be the first

104
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,399
guy great click the link but be sworn
there will be a couple of things I

105
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,829
didn't mean to do that today so watch
out for some basic basic commands for

106
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,630
IRC at the end of this I'll give you a
link to the slideshow so if you don't

107
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,390
have to write all this down you just
write coming ashore Google pickets to

108
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,180
set your nickname nickname can be
whatever you want it can be your name

109
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,930
from when you know your first name last
name however you wanna do it by is

110
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,769
actually a name that I used when I was
like 12 and brother was a cool skater

111
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,990
and had long hair using the french fries
I'm not creative enough to come up with

112
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,490
something new said so I'm stuck with
what I wasn't I was 12 message is a way

113
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,029
to do private messages and join us in
the message justice somebody else got

114
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:37,240
everybody in the room who lists who's in
the current channel but you're in list

115
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,100
is a list of all the channels it exists
join and leave his way to join and leave

116
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,050
rooms part is also another way to leave
ignore is a way if someone

117
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:55,120
someone costs only post things that you
don't like if someone offends you are

118
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,670
you using nor and they no longer you
never see anything that they do again it

119
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,310
doesn't come in showing her client you
literally ignore them is helpful in some

120
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,689
of the morning you don't have that
problem in the dressing room so much if

121
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,240
you get out on like three node or after
net or what some of the other ones there

122
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,630
are some people that have nothing good
to say no worries offense committed

123
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,459
those channels because you can still use
our channel and not have to listen to

124
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:29,149
the people to drop the wrong because
they think it's funny every 10 seconds

125
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:34,750
or whatever there are idiots out there
that's the Internet videos exist that's

126
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:42,350
how it is being as a way to emote to win
you normally type of IRC you put your

127
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,070
neck but when you type something how's
your neck in brackets and then it says

128
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,339
would you have stayed if you do the
meeting tomorrow to add a police officer

129
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:56,490
in practice you can say something like
he wants to go to watch and it was a

130
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,450
Saudi a quiet through lunch instead of
sodium and then started comment but its

131
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,810
you'll see it I use it sometimes if
someone says who wants to do this all

132
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:13,670
just do me in the space and I just put
my name on it there's many ways you get

133
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,649
in you see it

134
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,619
tits and even know the next thing that
message Nick serve identify them right

135
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:26,240
there you want to register your neck and
he talks a IRC that's a cool password

136
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,600
don't you think there's tension if
you're so you wanna message the next to

137
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,850
it to create your account that will
register you at nicks urban and that

138
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,629
means if you go right now and join the
Utah State IRC and try to save the year

139
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,309
nick is the first time I'm on there so
you can do it but second off if I worked

140
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:52,399
on and you try to do that it would say
this niggas registered message Nick

141
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,050
search to identify and I can login if I
log in and see someone I can kick you

142
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,779
off the IRC server because you took my
neck I had a red shirt and so that's

143
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,619
very handy thing to keep people from
participating you tab completion if

144
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,600
you're not familiar with that it works
and I recede quietly you should

145
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,410
absolutely use it because it makes your
life happy to take the first couple

146
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,059
letters of any of these commands a
recent pic or whatever it will do the

147
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,410
rest of the board

148
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,500
most people use GUI clients GUI clients
are great but most people use among the

149
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,430
computer they use which is generally
closer laptop you disconnect in the

150
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,258
middle of that such as you know what
happened about how do I get that backlog

151
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:43,040
said I'm not aware of the eighty public
mIRC longstreet si

152
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,459
just research the web this is where we
come in to persistent connections

153
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,819
diversity their tools to big schools of
thought here one of them is ira science

154
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:59,889
training and one of them is ian is a
bouncer like C&C so I earth science

155
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:10,800
train is literally this easy actually
come

156
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,160
so this is my drug screen anyway so
that's me and you just an IRC right now

157
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:24,209
if I come here to do in new revenue IRC
session I just started a new screen

158
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,469
session screen is a way to run
persistent demands an end unit devices

159
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,800
that works on Windows and Mac OS so
these things were going to Windows box

160
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:41,829
burgers or Linux and Mac OS and working
with those if not do that a lot of

161
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:48,089
people running on a box home box of work
you do the box the BBS is in somewhere

162
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:55,839
though you something you just started
his training session aside so toy can

163
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
enter here

164
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,600
this is what it is this is this is what
I tried looks like what you get a

165
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,999
running it's awesome because it's
connected all the time

166
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:16,189
a lot of people hate it because its
console Bates so I a science green are

167
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:21,309
fantastic because they're really really
easy to set up and taken literally taken

168
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:29,600
for commands in 30 seconds but their
little bit living in your next option is

169
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,490
CNC would use the bouncer I haven't
really played with bouncers until about

170
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,639
a week ago and I started this
presentation and the only reason you see

171
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:43,559
me using that iris as I said before it's
time to go over to about 40 see

172
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,740
basically deeds is a real quiet little
run it'll connect to the IRC server or

173
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,990
servers how many wanted to connect to
and then on the other end of presents as

174
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:01,470
a server to the World Service 017 C&C I
can run headshot connect my UC Browser I

175
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,959
can run by C&C bouncer iconoclasm iPhone
like my scenes bouncer as soon as i

176
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,250
connect busy bouncer since we all of the
back road but I've been at it since we

177
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,029
all the texts in whatever way I
connected to so I can see what happens

178
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,350
when I was gone I can run into my laptop
and suspended open my laptop as many

179
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,240
times as I want and no one season I'm
joining and leaving higher see they

180
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,399
don't know that we'll see that I'm
joining winning to this middleman DNC

181
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,760
bouncers are awesome

182
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:39,560
it takes a little bit more to set up
bill if you installed a Linux box I

183
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,540
believe Iran Linux and Mac OS I don't
know about Windows so much about that

184
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,300
but much you running your own this pig
combo making big file and I'll get you

185
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,640
started it runs a local WebSphere really
you can connect you to actually do the

186
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,360
deep dark configurations on to that Web
server really fall that how-to guide

187
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,360
right there and then we could you going
this is my new hotness my new favorite

188
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,460
way to do it again they see it as soon
as I got time converting all the way to

189
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,040
the agency so totally recommend that its
latest a consistent you can get the back

190
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,420
while you the old information connect to
it someday be aware however really easy

191
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,969
either IRC networks three nodes probably
more on the base most common ones now

192
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,190
things related to this conference in
this room to YouTube makers is pretty

193
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,200
cool that the bunch of guys to get
together and talk about building and

194
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,820
hacking electronics and getting things

195
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,050
21 guys if you want to know about
security you want to go deep down around

196
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,069
a whole go talk to them in a brilliant
people in there

197
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:57,600
you just a liar CSIRO obviously that is
used to be the de facto standard it

198
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,620
still is very big if there's something
you want to talk about talk about

199
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,430
chances are good freemen and/or asp.net

200
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,150

215
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,929

216
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,950
than I could have it when I did this
