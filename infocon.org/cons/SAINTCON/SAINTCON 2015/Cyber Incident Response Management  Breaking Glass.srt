1
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:37,519
get this started when I called breaking
glass everyone awake so I drove up here

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,050
from South Jordan woke up about five in
the morning when I Walking Dead fans

3
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,489
that right we don't catch up on the last
episode I watched it last night so now

4
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,010
I've got about five hours of sleep I'm
in a really bad mood so they killed off

5
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,239
one of the main characters and I just
not coping well so we'll see if we can

6
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:06,170
get a little bit about me my name is Jay
C senior security consultant with BAE

7
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,450
Systems white intelligence and be a
citizen who here has sort of a handful

8
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,820
so we're very very big company Roxy
split across two country roads who I

9
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,398
guess countries we have a European side
to PLC so it's under her majesty and we

10
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,259
have an uncle sam I'm under her
majesty's side so we hope you

11
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,050
specifically me and my team was focused
on the commercial sector for us'

12
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,280
responding to incidents also other
security services integration testing

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,360
assessment of the white primarily I
focus on its response namely proactive

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,020
and reactive who here has not heard of
proactive incident response and it seems

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:00,220
like an oxymoron right so one person so
proactive business all the activities to

16
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,950
get ready

17
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,630
specifically something like this
rebuilding and I are only friends it's

18
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,519
malware analysis prior to the consulting
life I was in the Marine Corps for years

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:21,790
stationed at Pendleton Marines army got
it about numbered

20
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,500
you get ugly and then recently i moved
from Virginia so I've been insulting for

21
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,879
about two years now still kind of
learning the area I was in San Diego and

22
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,700
so that's where you see my twitter
handle Dec so how come strong so I i

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,339
dont really care for the Salt Lake Utah
I could not something I could change my

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:50,879
handle getting into this job so why why
breaking glass so years that I've been

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,500
consulting specific songs I've noticed a
trend that organizations when I come in

26
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,030
and we do instant response and they're
responding to an incident they don't

27
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,530
make use Response Plan B have some for
some reason enough to actually during

28
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:19,329
the incident and as such they usually
respond so that's kind of why I'm giving

29
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:24,379
this a try and help you develop
something that's beneficial so that when

30
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:29,048
an act when an incident actually does
occur you're able to utilize some type

31
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:43,220
of response in terms of our security
posture had this debate with somebody

32
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,389
that incident response was actually a
part of your security posture this help

33
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:57,180
prevent you from being briefs as anybody
agree with that good will you out of the

34
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,739
water right now so the reason and I have
to slide right but little higher bonds

35
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,849
is essentially incident response happens
and if you read the abstract of the talk

36
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm quitting everything to fire

37
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,980
if you have a fire going on in your
building what good is all the

38
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,239
precautionary measures that you've taken
to prevent fires or is it making sure

39
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,719
that you don't these jeans shirt
protectors you don't operate your

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,530
toaster ovens right next to yours red
bins that the safety precautions it's

41
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,599
over your building's on fire now so
that's that's kinda why it's not really

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,520
a part of your security posture in the
sense that it's going to protect you

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,770
is this really the Hail Mary for you to
say what is already planning to stop

44
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:56,750
whatever attack is going on so what I
want to do is to define what a security

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,090
incident is what doesn't it responsibly
and looked like to me and then also

46
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,940
how's your organization respond using
the plan so before we get into that as I

47
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,150
mentioned there's there's a lot of
difficulties with organizations and/or

48
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,489
sending us the past couple years I've
noticed this and have actually dialed it

49
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,720
is fine by me and another consultant who
started to observe it is a fact in the

50
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,140
in the wild and i'm having w Congress
act who knows what did you become

51
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,169
operators are you do and there lies the
problem right a bunch of hands came up

52
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:45,530
out of the ones Eraserhead who is
actually seen that you are perfect so I

53
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,590
listened and went drastically battle but
they know about it and that is the big

54
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,479
problem with instant response plans is
essentially a little to no first-hand

55
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,220
experience in writing us it's something
we know we need some regulatory

56
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,460
requirements take that we have to have
it but we don't we don't know what it

57
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,930
actually looks like we've never ridden
one the next problem is that the

58
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,570
multiple opinions on the subject so for
every one that raised her hand that knew

59
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,500
what a trooper copper was handed you a
piece of paper and a pen and told you to

60
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,080
do to me

61
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,229
one elected back again they would all be
vastly different and I did bring paper

62
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,128
and pen to go inside beautifully memoir
iPod hold them up and then probably the

63
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:42,120
thing that the cost of producing killed
there is no single authoritative source

64
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:49,680
the site so a lot of you might say
there's this right

65
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,310
261 that we can use the nets are
authoritative source so let me back up

66
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,120
to share has a fully functional working
no doubt in your mind and you could

67
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,860
break it up

68
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:11,419
incident response claimed that way but
that's excellent because I mean

69
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,628
hopefully this talk is going to be very
effective unfortunately that's not great

70
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:21,759
in the landscape of paired with that
being said I just answered in a race how

71
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,080
many of you would say you started for me
to develop and I are much better

72
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,919
actually this is this is gonna junction
perfectly so out of the hands that race

73
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,000
how many of you have reference list how
many have went through a couple pages

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,009
into a way its peak right is cumbersome
nobody can really use it accurately

75
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,110
right there's great 20 and I'm gonna
show you one great pointing this is

76
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,330
pretty much the tried-and-true response
process consists of forming stages you

77
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,430
get your preparation detection announces
your containment eradication recovering

78
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,099
to post again soon activities and you'll
see the light on the life cycle actually

79
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:08,289
works really well where you prepare then
we detect them and they're gonna

80
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,830
literally go in circles until you clean
this thing all the way up please come on

81
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,469
in and plenty of real and then once you
clean it up

82
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:22,810
gonna start documenting it and then
you're gonna put everything away and

83
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,289
wait for the next fire

84
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:33,049
so we're going to look at the
preparation of this and what that means

85
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,139
is we're going to talk about definitions
will talk about the documentation teams

86
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:46,040
and logistics so the first thing I want
to do is I want to find an incident this

87
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,560
is my definition you can see how you
like I've had Twitter debates on Twitter

88
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,219
and there was some debates about it not
matching other people's interpretations

89
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,910
of an incident however I attributed to
two main things first thing is you can

90
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,209
root cause and the next thing is
malicious and they both feel like this

91
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:13,810
is a good definition right to make some
believers out again

92
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:40,660
yes question yes

93
00:09:40,660 --> 00:10:22,759
so and so that that could very well be
an incident at a great example and we're

94
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,680
going to a ripped apart a little bit
here but that would be a nightie

95
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:39,349
incident right and so imagine what
restoring all the backups of malicious

96
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,550
intent and thats differentiator I want
you to use to keep from falling out this

97
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,269
response process replay calling people
up on your recall roster and executing

98
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,949
incident response so we're trying to
find a way to differentiate so to his

99
00:10:53,949 --> 00:11:00,529
point exactly exactly Bob actually
tripped over cable the datacenter the

100
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:04,310
goal here is that yeah we can attribute
it to human root cause and we'll get

101
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,279
into root cause analysis but it doesn't
have malicious intent as such there's no

102
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,069
reason to respond with detection
analysis can payment now go put the

103
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:22,000
cable back in right so we want to
prevent that from happening up all these

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,920
resources and next thing is destroyed a
designer essentially this is my my act

105
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,010
of God right we don't have a human rude
comments and malicious intent is kinda

106
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:44,240
rate but it's the malicious intent is
for the short shorts look pretty

107
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,910
malicious when I watched it but it's
also not something that we can really

108
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,990
fix with instant response no more to his
Twitter debate somebody brought up with

109
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:03,420
great example when we look at human what
happens when you send an attachment

110
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,000
API hippocratic arts or whatever to
someone that you didn't mean to do we

111
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,310
have any incidents do we have an
incident yes here's here's the rub and

112
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,479
this is why uses definition do we have
seen in root cause to be happening this

113
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,230
context we done and the reason why I'm
so focused on the how is when we think

114
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,860
about the incident and yes a response

115
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,750
lifecycle look at all the steps we have
to do with the tax analysis with payment

116
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,630
eradication recovery we really just have
to tend to what we know was already

117
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,470
leaked there's no malicious intent which
means nobody's heard anything everything

118
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,290
is out in the open and you're really
just responding to a breach couldn't run

119
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,260
you know exactly what was taken the
person is being cooperative now if the

120
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,260
case was somewhat shifted where gt2
malicious employee is sneaking in texts

121
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,280
and then when you interview me I played
dumb then we're probably gonna step into

122
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,510
lines of malicious intent so that's why
I focus on the militias and part but I

123
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,850
feel like my definition works well for a
lot of my cases you might have to tweak

124
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:53,150
it for you or your business or any
questions before we move on

125
00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:09,280
blue team color like the most who came
ever so the Prophet penetration testers

126
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,240
yeah you should treat now and in most
cases you want no penetration test is

127
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,760
going on when it conducted that should
be coordinated with your CIO and

128
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,210
unbeknownst to you and then it's
beneficial because then you can treat it

129
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,810
like malicious activity and there's no
real harm in responding to it because it

130
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,910
gives you a good test and we'll talk
more about the great point you can see

131
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,510
penetration test however you want a lot
of companies will have all the police

132
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:39,270
camps and a white with the vulnerability
scanner and their sim so even though is

133
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,480
popping up a bunch of alert they just
ignore it it's up to you I also have

134
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,540
been called out to instance where the
company hired to pen test who didn't

135
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,270
document what day on a network and so we
were responding to malware from the

136
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,730
penetration thing so we open up the
binary little signature which was really

137
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,170
nice because we were able to call them
up and say hey did you do this on this

138
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,670
day to this box yes we were able to
close the case of costly for the company

139
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,900
but there was no real militias so we
could be easily right away again to

140
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,310
definitely doesn't show up to you if you
would like any other questions great

141
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:28,239
question so

142
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,580
there's really like the quintessential I
our plan something everybody is sitting

143
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,830
on it right now it's small it's generic
it's unreliable and usually its

144
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,970
unfinished on the other end I've been to
a few places where the direct opposite

145
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,190
its heavily documented it is very
regimented and it's the most difficult

146
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,990
one to read let alone use anybody have
something that big and proposed

147
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:03,779
documents when and AV alert pops up
after do step one and step three

148
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:11,580
I wanna keep us away from that mindset
is a horrible way to do it to my

149
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:19,510
framework approach so military history
buffs might know my friend on moco he

150
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,740
was eighteen thirties general field
marshal and the German army and he

151
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,610
essentially said quote doesn't really
work for me but it essentially boils

152
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,070
down to know and we'll survive
battlefield so what that means no matter

153
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,160
how will you plan how will you think and
strategize the second you actually go to

154
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,640
use it to fall apart right things are
unpredictable and really it's unfair to

155
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,890
sit us in a room in tasca with walking
through every type of incident and all

156
00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:00,060
the different variations of it and
trying to combat it so regularly we

157
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,069
should keep that in mind when we built
our IR plan would start with a high

158
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,619
level i our framework this is a simple
good that we can abstractly you always

159
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,379
write our teams or severity levels the
things that are not release specific

160
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,400
incidents who's heard about instant
playbook

161
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,280
your hands so out of the two hands
raised what's your definition instantly

162
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,540
book

163
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,870
raise your hands

164
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:59,340
strategy and so on the Blue is a plant
operators I think two or three three and

165
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,350
write somebody might add them up
warner's two of the three right when we

166
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,610
think about the Star Wars commercial
that aired during football

167
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,899
the football game right now it's pretty
cool huh we were like the only guys

168
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,929
that's all for those that play football
and for those of us including myself in

169
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,429
a place where is the idea of a playbook
that consists of plays based on the

170
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,920
situation that you're in there might be
a play that's the most beneficial for

171
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,700
you to execute to try and help you win
the game or win essentially trying to

172
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,280
stop the simpson so the idea behind the
incident PlayBook is that it's a very

173
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,500
focused approach toward specific
incident and what we can do that is not

174
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,900
get bogged down are mired down by all
the details music really big

175
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,640
everybody tries to encapsulate and we'll
talk more about that in the first let

176
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,710
slip through the night our framework in
the IR framework essentially you have

177
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,880
five names that you want to capture
capture more based on your organization

178
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,350
these are the ones that I suggest you
start with the first one is a thirty we

179
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,370
start to the stock a handful of you
raise your hands and said we were

180
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,830
working on an inservice how many of you
are doing this out of the goodness of

181
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,270
your heart

182
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:27,590
being mandated by a sea level or
equivalent to get this done so I assume

183
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,250
the rest of you all have some type of
executive backing yes maybe not have

184
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,180
executive backing this trend
particularly

185
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,460
we have one person discharging up the
hill stop don't stop keep doing what

186
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,380
you're doing

187
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:50,110
try and see this authority is going to
get you right and so we're talking money

188
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,870
for head count for training for
equipment everything you need

189
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,590
actually respond effectively next thing
it's gonna do operate in the face with a

190
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,340
business on your behalf of approval to
operate is pretty important when you're

191
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,090
about to unplug a server or disconnect
the entire corporate network from the

192
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,870
internet which in some cases might be
justified

193
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,070
so these are the guys that are going to
back you up when things are actually

194
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:25,149
going back next thing was interface what
the business is a very good chance you

195
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,680
and your organization don't understand
how everything interacts with everything

196
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,650
else this is the person that can help
carry the message and show the reason

197
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,850
why your actions are necessary and why
they need to be done now any questions

198
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,530
about authority before you go any
further

199
00:20:43,530 --> 00:21:00,260
make sure that you secured this eighteen
so I think so you need to have your

200
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,820
instant response team broken out into
three main groups and it seems the most

201
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,340
actives you're gonna have a primary team
in the primary team as a team that

202
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,909
you're going to use a consult or contact
the most so essentially anytime anything

203
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,870
goes that you will meet 7 incident

204
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,159
these are the team members that if
you're probably going to be included in

205
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,920
that discussion the next thing is
extended team and these are going to be

206
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,120
people that have business roles that can
assist you in responding to an incident

207
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,309
last week third parties and there have
been some doozies

208
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,590
where third-party support was critical
because we've been future places and

209
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:51,279
plan ahead just wasn't there and we'll
talk about the first thing so how many

210
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,179
of us in this room are split between
itBut and security duties at the same

211
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:02,409
time don't worry guys get the shadow
idea group to an ideal for use in focus

212
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:09,929
on security and trust them excellent so
essentially you need your sis how many

213
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:20,940
of you in this room have five rolls here
relations you the one man a team so

214
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,369
essentially I hope that you're the one
person team simply because your

215
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:28,610
organization

216
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:37,490
enough to warrant it is so you put it
down to entirely is it and I are

217
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,200
analysts at the minimal and the benefit
of that is you have one person

218
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,840
coordinating the high-level execution of
your incident while the other person

219
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,709
researches is how many of you have tried
to conduct analysis on it right now and

220
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:03,740
got bogged down by phone calls from
everybody wanted statuses so much you

221
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,929
laugh my drink right we are celebrating
this is so central you want to have that

222
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:14,669
security role without at least at those
two levels and what that's going to do

223
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,619
is enable you to interface with the
business look at the big picture at the

224
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:21,299
same time someone's trying to figure out
what actually happened

225
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,600
additional you're going to need the
support of your server teams in network

226
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,619
deemed your help this team not
underestimate those of us that are lucky

227
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:36,299
enough to have a better way to help us
to leverage their assistance by doing

228
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:40,999
this weekend off a load of work
especially from the analysts I it's we

229
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:47,929
label could simply be making an
acquisition of a survey how many classes

230
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:54,779
and acquisitions forensic analysis
handful right it would be much better if

231
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,610
we could pass it off with other things
correct just take a while

232
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:05,258
Guinness not and probably the hardest
one because you can't just put these

233
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:08,950
guys in the room working you might ask
in the morning it's being called out

234
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,470
here in the spring work like you have a
clue what you're talking about you gonna

235
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,080
want your business executives to a lot
of organizations are split into

236
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,908
different business district business
areas all with their own unique mission

237
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,369
objectives you're gonna want to make
sure you have the year of those people

238
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:31,139
help understand the risks and
communicate the problem of the incident

239
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:38,350
how it impedes business and why it must
be remedied or its gonna suck not remedy

240
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,779
is a few organizations that one except
at risk

241
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:47,610
China Russia river and colleagues have
left yesterday but we're gonna ride the

242
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:58,979
risk of the daily life and we're gonna
get a beer after this the next thing is

243
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,090
your legal team secondly after the
executives your legal team is your best

244
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,019
bet at the ones that are going to make
sure the acquisition that you take the

245
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:17,820
documentation that you keep is all
accurate and able to be used in court if

246
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,029
the need arise they're also going to
help you in determining what you can do

247
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:28,320
and can't be one of the worst incidents
is insider activity recent insider

248
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,509
activity what do these people have
usually have a is this and then Hamas a

249
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:40,950
lot of times they cross-contaminate so
they're checking their email their VPN

250
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,679
in from their home connection that
pulling these files down so if you

251
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,299
detect and determined to whatever
solution or process you have that you

252
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,999
have an insider threat and they're
pulling the stated down onto their home

253
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,290
computers

254
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,950
what are your options

255
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:15,780
legal team with a great point there's a
lot of different avenues you can take to

256
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,920
making sure legally charges in their
your communications team we got into the

257
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,830
discussion of handling a breach whether
accidental or antenna if you're going to

258
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,060
have to communicate that information now
is a good chance that your communicator

259
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,679
and team never thought about how they
would disseminate information about a

260
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,870
breach to its customers or to the
general public next how many of us have

261
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:53,459
risk and compliance teams won so on top
of that these guys are putting all these

262
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,890
mandates down on you that makes your job
even harder so ideally your risk and

263
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,700
compliance can help you can identify
before you go to executives in

264
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,980
understanding what the problem of this
compromise or the state of being leaked

265
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,320
is if they're a tip top compliance risky
move already done the analysis to save

266
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,330
your ground rules and this physical
security how many of us have card access

267
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:32,970
glogs camera footage who you are said to
review camera footage

268
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,310
face every morning we go right camera
footage of worsening however if it works

269
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:44,570
it is great especially for instance
where somebody walks into a server room

270
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,370
because it's a physical Windows Server
2008 walks

271
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,949
and remote indications witness it will
show the only way and they're actually

272
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,380
physically login there's a camera in the
Davis center and then you can call early

273
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:06,130
and say that person you actually log in
and then you have a better case camera

274
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,460
footage just really important there are
times when we still the way we know the

275
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,530
guy login we have two big time stamp
security camera footage 42 days ago only

276
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:25,020
keep forty days at camera footage so
keep that in mind when you work with

277
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,490
these teams and you ask for their help
and input because they're gonna be the

278
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,630
give you those numbers so you know this
second but you have an incident of

279
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,600
fourteen days of footage we need to
chapter right now pull it off we can't

280
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,820
wait and then the other team to think of
any questions with this list again to

281
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,270
big point is to take this list and go
work with the seams and make sure they

282
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,420
understand their roles and how they can
assist a lot of that will be in

283
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,080
discussions learning their job roles
it's not illegal teens are the same not

284
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,270
only charts internecine some work to do
something someone some of you might get

285
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,170
a bit of parties have your legal team
actually request out to things like

286
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,460
outside general counsel to weigh in on
these matters not much they may not be

287
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:17,820
equipped for things like babe reaches so
I talked about third-party I G this is

288
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,490
probably one of the most painful ones
how many of us utilize some type of

289
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,520
remote hosting we don't actually own the
whole store the data center servers

290
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:34,540
which I was a handful of us think about
this from an instance for your view that

291
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:41,300
raise your hands is an incident happened
on that server how we get what

292
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:49,169
contractual obligations the company has
to fulfill that request is it a shared

293
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,380
host with a bunch of other tenants on it
and see you can't get anything except

294
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:07,640
maybe just a few songs question
contractual obligations with our

295
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,800
providers and what they're responsible
for how they can help us texting is

296
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,960
forensic firms how many of us do not
have the capability to do our own

297
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:30,630
digital forensics malware analysis
capability we don't have whatever making

298
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,950
sure we have some type of retailer is
beneficial

299
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,330
now we can call somebody up on if you've
noticed the news to spend lots of data

300
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,899
breaches right BC to Greece's happening
musically in the press releases they

301
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,070
were working with law enforcement and
working with some leading provider of

302
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,409
security solutions or something all
these people getting tied up they have

303
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:57,080
so much human resources that when you
have an incident who actually has people

304
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:04,949
available to come at you in 24 hours
that's a difficult thing making sure

305
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,790
that we have that on Sept the other
thing is if you don't have a retainer

306
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:14,750
think about the new requirements NBA try
and purchase a router right what a pain

307
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,340
is it just get that proved right

308
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,639
now you have gotten it so you can't
circumvent your legal processes your

309
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,500
processes your procurement processes
total exist for a reason to try and get

310
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,330
ahead of them

311
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,689
enforcement who here has communication
with their law enforcement group whether

312
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,549
it be police FBI Secret Service

313
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:45,650
work with them there's a handful of you
usually have great information to give

314
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,529
you about something related to your
industry or overall in general you can

315
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,549
usually take these are usually full of
IOC's you can scan your network and

316
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:58,899
sometimes you get unlucky enough to find
something and that's beneficial working

317
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:03,070
with them they can usually offer because
it provided that they understand the

318
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,480
case and they can help make your
response can tell you why you might have

319
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,809
been targeted or they might be able to
do it now sits on your behalf

320
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,860
what's important to you start working
out those relationships how can you

321
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,990
benefit each other public relations seen
kind of like communications in the event

322
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:29,470
that they are not skilled enough to
handle a brief response so for instance

323
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,320
how many of us have had our identity
your credit cards compromise from a

324
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,658
breach man I was passes hand I've seen
in the west that's being shot up like a

325
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:44,029
rocky yeah so there may be more so than
others but we all felt that right how

326
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:49,720
did the community websites email we all
got some more public relations team

327
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,890
capable of forming those unable to set
up a 800 number are you able to drop a

328
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,750
website for people to get more
information

329
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,059
these are things that benefit us if we
can stop them

330
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:11,789
surance who has Type R ancients yeah
it's not about that

331
00:33:11,789 --> 00:34:05,809
a bad thing at all most of the time
they're getting so nice so usually you

332
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,750
cannot call these out in one punch with
cyber insurance and it's beneficial

333
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,969
because they know exactly what they're
doing there is an extent or limitation

334
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:46,168
of what they can help with him I go out
after two hundred hours but

335
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:54,089
interface with all the different
pharmacy he has in his kitchen local

336
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:58,450
government right having their da office
their law enforcement you not being

337
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,210
government have your legal team your
physical security gonna come in and

338
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,470
interfacing help you run that incident
which is a great feeling especially if

339
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:14,060
they wanted to see some documentation
and how

340
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:24,110
you ran to be able to quote your policy
right xoxo about a year this is

341
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,460
something we can call up GEICO 15
minutes or less

342
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:36,270
so the next thing after we've got our
teams logistics UPS and whatnot first

343
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,670
one is email distribution groups how
many of us have an email to show that we

344
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:47,270
used for just security messages and call
bridge great how many of us know how

345
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:55,780
many of us have actually use a call
bridge to talk about it is quite some

346
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:13,420
level of knowledge is is just that may
have been in a handful of War Rooms wine

347
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,350
that was slightly smaller than this was
a huge fortune 500 company and we talked

348
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:25,319
I T teens these guys have like a person
1740 person network team so when you get

349
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,350
all these heads in amazing things happen
but that's only beneficial when you get

350
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,950
them all in a room talking to each other
and hash it out so making sure yet some

351
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:41,230
dedicated space probably not the law be
able or the cafeteria something where we

352
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:46,450
construct the next thing is computer
equipment how many of us have forensic

353
00:36:46,450 --> 00:37:05,410
work stations and an evidence

354
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:13,980
so the next few things are things I see
people forget about all the time in

355
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,070
terms of their first one a succession of
command who here has vacation days on

356
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:26,470
the books now we want to take a right so
if you're out whose it during the

357
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,779
incident we really inexpensive we get a
war room it's worth it to bring in a

358
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,510
couple pizzas or some sandwiches and not
have to go away from lunch or dinner if

359
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:43,380
it goes that level of evidence who has
geographically dispersed locations you

360
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,690
know who does this retail retail
environments suffer from this if you

361
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,510
have all these source all the stores get
compromise how do you get all that

362
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:58,220
evidence back to one place they don't
have a very big factor was the last one

363
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,299
I want to downshift a little bit
operational tempo right up-tempo

364
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,250
how hard you're gonna work everybody in
one case that I work they had one guy

365
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,400
that was going on for twenty-some-odd
hours right he started working he went

366
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,110
to the night he was still burning and
finally he decided to go home right is

367
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,170
like asking them drove home been in a
car accident

368
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:26,130
pay attention operational tempo
succession of command rights very

369
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:35,360
important that we don't overwork are
people who are trying to help us as we

370
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,060
define severity since a lot of you raise
your hands tell me that you were also

371
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,430
insecurity a lot of times we get
confused when we prioritize with parity

372
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,730
for example we try to prioritize on
impact for example I want to talk about

373
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,460
it you have to prioritize right low
medium high orkut and modern malware on

374
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,370
a single engineers workstation how we
rate that dole it out

375
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:06,150
low medium high medium in the middle

376
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:12,069
almost anybody else low medium high on
the spot

377
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:18,000
low we got a low an engineer's work
season right what happened data is on

378
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,799
that workstation so when I submit that
the process involves the classification

379
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:28,069
what does that you don't have access to
talk about my local pictures you see

380
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:33,329
right through the committee member from
malware commodity hours a stupid stupid

381
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,779
dumb dumb term like apt right it doesn't
actually provide you any information to

382
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:45,770
strength since is a banking Trojan right
information there also but people sell

383
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:51,569
on a form some underground site access
to and in the guy that makes the lock in

384
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:56,549
2013 buys a bunch and drop script no
longer do your banking Trojan just turn

385
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:01,950
into a ransom are chosen so you can't
really based on the mound itself you

386
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,759
have malware on the site that malware
has dropped additional pylons you need

387
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,589
to consider that and then the beta
sensitivity how many of us have been

388
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:12,970
across the nation

389
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:19,089
guides person that's going to be
instrumental order within two points to

390
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,940
tell you how important it has it is

391
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:29,250
engineers workstation you don't really
want to get a chance next few things in

392
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,910
the last few things are your post
incident actively supporting

393
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,399
documentation for instance you want root
cause analysis root cause analysis is

394
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,079
possible given to you want your lessons
learned

395
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:51,640
root cause analysis was done root cause
analysis with our scenario with bright

396
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,569
object on the table with a root cause
analysis

397
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:14,580
but some of those forerunners protection
right root cause analysis for this one

398
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,900
is pretty simple right

399
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,800
it's something that we can actually take
aggressive action to we can fix this

400
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,920
from occurring

401
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:33,340
of crap to do what about talking it up
was a root cause analysis somebody else

402
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:41,510
for shark nato and I appreciate that
joke right

403
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,040
global warming sure I get it how do we
address global warming

404
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,860
well chances are high school want me to
know what is a root cause of stroke NATO

405
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,000
members are committed to god of
datacenter what caused it we can

406
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,020
actually address which depicts the
dissenters up know right well as the

407
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:14,440
other one BR we don't have a Dr site if
we had our we did we get to switch over

408
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,520
to our disaster recovery site and we be
good things you put it in iowa where the

409
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,310
service can get it

410
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:30,840
so now she's really important we talk
about incidents how how did the how did

411
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:38,780
the incident occurred how did this
because we've got a window seat down in

412
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,730
action and somebody will do what makes
what was it and how can we actually

413
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,150
addressing fix the next thing you know
lessons learned a brief the once

414
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:54,220
everything is settled in pain we
eradicated we've recovered we want to

415
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,330
document how do we prevent this from
occurring

416
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:01,230
leverage that root cause analysis
strengthen the our plan what works for

417
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,870
us what helps you want to find areas of
improvement how many of us are PCI

418
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:18,839
acquired organizations right how often
do we have to testify our planet

419
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:32,990
and we don't know how you leave and
really is that good how many of us do

420
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,169
with something going on right now like
we're probably check your email because

421
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:46,270
there's no one around how many of us
feel with an incident a week a month or

422
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:58,530
so take that time to your I our plan we
had our lessons learned and that's a

423
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,820
process that we used to update it you're
gonna see in complaints really easily

424
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:08,260
and also gonna get a smoking hot are
planning systemic issues make sure you

425
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,720
correlate with your past incident make
sure you look at them and say hey you

426
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,490
know what this is like the kind that bob
has had a fishing village result in

427
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,359
malware

428
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:25,260
I love with some special training or
maybe this Windows 2003 Server probably

429
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,980
should be upgraded because it keeps
getting the DMC right let's find a way

430
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:35,790
to identify systemic issues and then
treat them and then lastly look over

431
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,480
four errors in their final report make
sure everything's documented make sure

432
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,090
everybody reviews these participate in
the NCAA baguettes feedback your legal

433
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:50,160
team reach our team executives ideally
you want to have lessons learned with

434
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,680
every single incident with a bunch of
clothes and some really practical is so

435
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,669
take all your clothes every two weeks
and just have a post-mortem meeting to

436
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,290
review all the lows maybe you'll find
systemic issues how many of us getting

437
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,009
my results

438
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:17,840
we get out how many of us actually
trends in the incidence anybody not into

439
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:26,790
incidents just as AV we did we're done
we are weak or leaving them saying hey

440
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:35,140
this thing works easy getting hit or it
got hit every month the first Friday of

441
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,540
the month I was looking at those things
are trying to write so we talk about

442
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:47,250
data breaches existing 200 some odd days
right why is the virus is getting on

443
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:53,730
there some way for some route what is it
right and the only thing separating you

444
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:00,000
thought bennies talk about how your AV
Solutions suck you didn't what happened

445
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,690
here

446
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:12,230
great so your a/v solutions to soccer
here is that they have signatures it's

447
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,770
not very hard to evade them right so
what's the chance

448
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:21,270
boxes actually compromise and the guy
just left the script old same power down

449
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:27,140
on the first Friday of every month you
just completely ignored it so consider

450
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,660
those things now it's getting to the
PlayBook the PlayBook is essentially a

451
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:40,290
predefined response procedure for every
incident so you're aware your machine

452
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:47,580
unauthorized access theft is this how
you deal with it specifically so these

453
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:55,360
are discussed take a figure out if we
had a loss laptop what would happen if

454
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,920
we don't get reported would we even know
what helped us reach out to the user

455
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,730
just call it a day it's encrypted right
these are things that we need to put our

456
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,130
playbook it's how we would respond to
any questions

457
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:14,180
very hard to go deep into what books
should have because three specific to

458
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,129
your incident but this is where you just
come up with a very specific approach

459
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,980
for how you handle on how you handle a
book as you get the incidents so that

460
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:30,490
they are a laptop was lost we might
start having a decision tree says hey

461
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,729
here's an unencrypted laptop years and
include the legals ok with his with

462
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,980
their not ok with its ok to report for
cyber insurance this is where everything

463
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,670
starts so you come together and it's
what you can send to reliably every

464
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:52,539
single time any questions with us now

465
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,099
next thing I promise you with the last
five minutes I got is testing

466
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:00,099
methodologies this is probably the most
fun and I do a lot of work in testing

467
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:04,539
specifically around tabletop exercise
some more games that's where things get

468
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:09,299
really fun however I bring the
Chupacabra back a lot of people talk

469
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:12,880
about these things they don't really
know what it entails so hopefully this

470
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,670
will try and illustrate what you should
be looking for ways to try and test this

471
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,170
by using these methods first one I love
about it but I texted me in that

472
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:29,089
corridor however they provided the files
use this as a quick audit right how in

473
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,759
compliance with such that I talked about
do we have what should we have for this

474
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:39,630
not make sense less at this let's not at
this that's very easy for you to do

475
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:44,900
right when you get home today after this
conference you can do these more

476
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,369
specific we have this huge criteria that
we look for it we base it on your

477
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:53,759
industry right for PCI you probably
don't want to have your in this area and

478
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:59,160
hip if you don't have either of those
who want to be more IP specific next

479
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,370
time is an objective basis

480
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:08,430
right Starsky and Hutch sounds good it
actually do the things right so if we

481
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,919
talk about cost financing we have the
capability lets see how you close the

482
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,130
financing come up with some scenarios
and classify and see that makes sense to

483
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,020
find your set verities write the next
most important one is everybody thinks

484
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,460
they can acquire a server have you done
it have you done it in the past two

485
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,210
years and have it retested what about
p.m. many of you are running virtual

486
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:38,040
infrastructure and you try to acquire a
server with memory for forensics keeping

487
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,200
ahead of make sure you can do that
that's that's huge p.m. so get popped

488
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:52,640
right there's a lot of frantic
challenges expertise on and see if you

489
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,859
can actually keep that would be a good
determining a way to determine if you

490
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,210
have the capability next thing and near
and dear to my heart because my dad

491
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:08,710
wants to me the Dungeons and Dragons
will never get anywhere in life right so

492
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:15,290
that's dragons for me is essentially how
I conduct my table talks essentially we

493
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:19,290
get the people that need to be in the
room were split up with technical and

494
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,730
then an executive from people like to
get everybody in the room and all the

495
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:28,110
scenario so instead of having your
sorting entering the dungeon you're now

496
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:33,310
sitting at your desk maybe look for my
favorite is the Los laptop and if you

497
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,770
want we'll talk about that one after the
talk show you how person told him

498
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,730
everything is notional right we all
talked about how we're going to do it

499
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,990
and we role play and see if we're very
if we have the capability or if we

500
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:51,160
forgot everything and that allows us to
identify weaknesses make you my secret

501
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,990
sauce with my Star Trek fans Kobayashi
route I do all my table tops with

502
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,770
Kobayashi Maru test in mind and what
that means for the nine we got three

503
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,170
guys and we've got it

504
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:20,480
six starts explains so what is the
reason so I structure my table tops to

505
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,740
drive absolute failure right there's no
way that you're gonna find the malware

506
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,149
stop it be able to contain the briefs
not everything's getting out you're done

507
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,520
host but also with the water and what
that allows me to do is take them all

508
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,040
the way to failure in find weaknesses

509
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,339
oh yes just like it don't matter right
you you seriously take all the

510
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:50,150
considerations a plane find a sponsor
with inside knowledge so you can

511
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:54,309
understand the technology complain
complain around them to great question

512
00:51:54,309 --> 00:52:03,410
and then lastly Lucy Heartbreak Ridge
Way right so I is the war game a lot of

513
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,569
people called the purple team assessing
its where you take your team and a red

514
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:12,420
team pen test for them together and you
get right to essentially a war game for

515
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:18,190
us is work going to conduct a pen test
at the same time a strict we're going to

516
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,160
give you an IR liaison and what that
reason is gonna do is coordinate your

517
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,180
activities the blue team with the
activities of the red team and document

518
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,690
what you're able to find in this goes to
what you were asking about document what

519
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,349
you're able to find where you're lacking
and how they're getting around you if we

520
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,569
were if we had any highway up here
remember the scene were made of the

521
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:44,390
major powers right would always be some
recon team is always be in this position

522
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:52,150
what's actually use RIR team stop the
pensions and see where we succeed with

523
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:56,829
that we are done I want to thank
everyone for coming I know who was

524
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:01,500
really early in the morning thanks same
conference in a great venue BAE said any

525
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:08,500
kind of talk whether any quick questions
one and then I'll be outside and we can

526
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:15,930
chat more after this

527
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:23,190
sure so essentially its defining a
scenario that has a risk that's what

528
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:27,980
makes sense the business to business has
a UTI concern right I'm going to focus

529
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:35,090
on feeling their PC I did I'm gonna work
with them to determine what security

530
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:39,310
they have a place what risks they have a
place and leverage those through

531
00:53:39,310 --> 00:54:06,950
scenario and slowly hand out information
I think responded with a question

532
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,899
thank you again thanks everyone for
coming out
