1
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:54,200
and the true story call him brian has
named Ryan came home one day this is

2
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,330
gonna have a bad day

3
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:07,740
CEO's office say this is what your
senior season their head buyers right

4
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,620
slashing lives there is no choir and the
start over

5
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,510
you can probably imagine what's coming
and they're so Brian's house burned to

6
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:31,359
the ground and fortunately it was
unfortunate it's as if this is ok not a

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,030
problem we had a bit of a data breach
some of our stuff for Davis left our

8
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,370
grandmas control first responders here
the forensics teams here they're doing

9
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:53,780
their assessment of things out gonna be
okay and then you hear him say he sees

10
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,390
the news and news man is now here so
it's no longer your business is business

11
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,329
that you'd like to release that
information not so thats

12
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:17,130
in his mind he or she is thinking in
their mind what did we get here how did

13
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,960
this decision and I don't know what
would be really for your your

14
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,100
environment if you have a situation
however brian is pretty straightforward

15
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:35,350
photo lies a very telling truth I think
it applies to both I T and home

16
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,640
ownership and you may not be able to see
it so this brainless in Phoenix so in

17
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,589
Phoenix their specific things that
happened due to the weather in the

18
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:54,450
summer make it tonight with that it's
also not very cold in the winter so here

19
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:07,260
is something in this season's has to do
with that byron there is only three

20
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,049
years is a couple of times a year that
means we can grow things that may be

21
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,280
more in line for a tropical climate like
four inches for example there there or

22
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,760
in any way so when it was free it would
cover your plans for some sort of blamed

23
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,080
he keep them warm

24
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,969
died and oranges all through the winter
has this really hope so the blanket is

25
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,880
kind of like the latest installed

26
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:51,200
your e-mail spam the blanket the problem
is is that if you did have a breach you

27
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,969
probably have a problem in your floor
now working your core configuration

28
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,650
update your passing and most importantly
your users ok so Ryan's problem with

29
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,630
this house is that he added on a room in
back to his house and I don't know if

30
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,610
you did away with the warnings to get a
core problem with this house that would

31
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,110
have been easy to solve Bryant requires
a little more work but would result in

32
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,590
his house not the grounds so don't be
like Brian don't put the blame on the

33
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:34,239
black box and not cover the date six so
how are these breaches occurring any

34
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,570
ideas

35
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,950
firewalls no no one's hacking firewalls
I mean somebody is maybe somewhere where

36
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:55,469
something but rising 23% emails and
attachments how are they getting in so

37
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,950
obviously are set for sour

38
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:13,349
Casey have 60 minutes to reduce the rate
by 50 percent of the problem may be

39
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,460
Thurs had cyber espionage has included

40
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:26,640
66% you have to look first few seconds
to compose email saying don't work on

41
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:35,510
this side against your lunch may be too
late

42
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,770
alright so there's a couple of data
points from my own and in the senate

43
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:49,669
involved in and got two case studies one
is a mature company they've been around

44
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,190
I mean in the triple digits of years
long time and then we're going to

45
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:02,010
compare them to get started pretty good
sized company but fairly similar sample

46
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:09,969
size hundred and thirty 85% open trade
order company k and three on the on the

47
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:21,260
other company so I'm not a math genius
he 500% 385 raised by people have

48
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:28,520
clicked on this email one time this is a
hundred sixty-five place and saying that

49
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,049
even on the on the uncertain about how

50
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:42,180
24 unique logins from the mature company
58% tried to do it more than one time at

51
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,599
work not just tried again and then for
some reason to pasture then gave me

52
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:53,289
their Newcastle which is nice I mean I
can see that nice legs start-up not much

53
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,780
different 64 login Cyrus insect larvae
higher but then I got ninety most asking

54
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,979
for support I'm a nice guy Hayes not
working right now my team team we're

55
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,050
working on it

56
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:15,620
check back in 30 minutes so shocking to
anyone besides you were shocked if I

57
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:31,460
wouldn't be in here so members baby so
out there if you have to run an argument

58
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,370
to get funding whatever you do or time
or whatever it is that organization from

59
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:47,279
doing now and data their DVR prices are
as good as well so how can you do this

60
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:56,250
cases to make it successful anyone can
do it we've got princes from Tanzania

61
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,279
wherever they are they are doing
obviously a bit of a target market there

62
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:06,350
but so gotta convince them to write a
check for business sometimes that carry

63
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,699
out or so

64
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:23,868
you the first time it's actually does
periodically so they see the video and

65
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:32,389
I'm serious I open until users just beat
it up get the first one done its funding

66
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:39,279
may be great just let me do one will get
it done and then look at the data

67
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,160
guarantee you you will be guaranteed as
much money as you need as much money as

68
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,939
you going on a quarterly basis which is
gay

69
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:55,748
give this tax and then the important
part sometimes we need to train the

70
00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:00,439
users it's not be users were gonna trick
them we're gonna do things to them that

71
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:08,079
no human student at a human hey it's me
it's Melissa it's not nice and we're

72
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,709
doing it right that's all we have to
train them now this isn't necessarily

73
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,979
we're not training them to avoid targets
of opportunity that's the prince in

74
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,939
tanzania or whatever and wherever it is
those are targets of opportunity that

75
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,230
they're looking for

76
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,149
we're trying to avoid the next level
which is targets somebody that your

77
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,690
organization's been targeted for
specific reason

78
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:41,590
about her behaviour so we're going to
get some money running the first time

79
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,520
report that creates and then we're going
to help our users not only learn the

80
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,870
things of this giuliani things that
should look for but we're going to help

81
00:10:52,870 --> 00:11:01,750
them to be motivated to keep you going
alright we're gonna talk about this is

82
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,120
variable and basing it we get people to
do what we wanted you

83
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:21,160
13 obviously so I'll make it relevant it
may be that your organization you want

84
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,699
to check some kind of Laura Brown like
hey we're doing a blood drive is in that

85
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,700
when you may not be or what I like to do
is make this specific it's possible to

86
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,970
the company one of the take up early
with the data I knew there would be

87
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:42,670
buildings so I sent an e-mail reference
for building a pretty successful and

88
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,849
we'll talk about it got some examples
here as well so what is happening what's

89
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,670
given some contacts what's happening in
your position right now and then make it

90
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,500
believable right in the verbiage that
you use in your company if you use an

91
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,570
acronym for something

92
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,580
throw it in there that makes more
believable now we're making the body of

93
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,240
the email buried but there's gonna be
the normal flags there should be able to

94
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,579
pick up on and they will be able to come
up with the given the proper training

95
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,849
ok so get a domain these people are very
happy with their domain maybe they're

96
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,499
getting married submitting to me how to
read anyway so these are some of the

97
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:28,689
means I've used to demean saks.com so we
gotta run to make those are a couple of

98
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:36,769
of ideas and then there's always a
lighter note say to someone's that I get

99
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:41,559
for our company so this is where it
comes into play

100
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,339
who in here you see him at all

101
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:52,879
ok that doesn't happen does a great deal
of 18 USC and again at 11 everyone loves

102
00:12:52,879 --> 00:13:01,519
it how to proceed with the amazon has
promised us is pretty cool so as a

103
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:12,220
service called route 33 where she may
get the reference 53 is used for DNS

104
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,970
J

105
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,769
so we're gonna go to rapidly 32 Amazon
account and would have to have to open

106
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:32,919
Amazon accounts credit cards and maybe a
face to face so credit card credit card

107
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:40,369
card and then your face up to rate
remained around 53 if you want to get to

108
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,310
different sources

109
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:50,400
a little box later so little box in
certain areas were gonna do

110
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,949
resides so resumes you three straight
boy and I was trying to register for our

111
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:07,680
company and I use the Greek letter a
different Unicode I tried it didn't like

112
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:07,890
it

113
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:13,660
thankfully Ramazan they said hey you're
not read anything on the screen like

114
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:24,469
we're gonna bounces back from regular a
problem would get most of our guys ok

115
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:31,120
but I did slip the Greek language even
get it to submit so for now but see

116
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,430
racism and thank you hang out for a
minute we'll send you an email I know

117
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:41,189
when you're ready you can check in your
pending requests in 33 over here to work

118
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:50,310
rate of 45 anyway and progress and then
use the failure of my reach litter a

119
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:57,319
domain so that it working for different
register or mechanisms they used to the

120
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,350
doctor does it up on his predecessor
which I just made it the second day

121
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:12,370
which is also preceptor sense it's not
really an addict Behav circuits and

122
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,720
clicks having to give me a min

123
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:28,689
53 is just a list of names down 69
protected outsole james rubin never done

124
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:39,420
so looks like it is my domain walesa
catches you can swap receive but cannot

125
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,449
get the uppercase lowercase things just
recreate something that's what you got

126
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:57,829
going early so we're gonna set up being
shocked by saying a penis right now

127
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:06,638
knowing is good news

128
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,319
easy it's super easy especially if you
buy your domain gravity three

129
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,729
going here and we've got the street and
then

130
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:27,329
we still here posted sounds we have
three yes I did have read that thing

131
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:34,219
that's easy easy i'm happier I don't
like things that are hard things are a

132
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,940
lot of work to be easy and when things
just happen for me because I like those

133
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,730
people about those things to do so it's
all done you have to do anything I click

134
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,180
on their second look at it it's there
and then once you're in here here's the

135
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,979
settings for your your domain the only
thing you'll ever need to know this this

136
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,930
is you ought to have a server that will
talk about as well

137
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:11,129
entry here and a record for your IP of
your server but super easy basically

138
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:18,160
here and I don't think so that means all
set up if you want to use Gmail you can

139
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,250
put those MX records in here

140
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,240
disclaimed other good thing about it is
it's lots of documentation did you

141
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:34,070
really good job by step how to do this
and you can read more it's pretty well

142
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,770
honestly so if you have questions about
that issue gone to that there's

143
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:47,120
documentation so sorry I send email
right so

144
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:56,699
we need to run one that sounds hard I
don't like exchange exchange the

145
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:10,380
exchange for smart so are you sorry Jay
sounds hard to do something to set up a

146
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,620
case policy at simply mail service in
here and again the little cardboard box

147
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,120
in the corner to find the SES and then
it brings you here

148
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,219
verified yes yes please put your domain

149
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,140
generated details to the gym settings
are a little bit of a signing a

150
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,880
lucrative graphic signing on your email
outgoing mail server email box revealed

151
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,100
train will say is assigned to get out
some long but guess what to do it all

152
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:53,899
you do is box so check is a check box
then were gonna be revised two main

153
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,950
there's a bunch of stuff to top

154
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,429
that's boring that's hard I don't know
what those letters numbers and stuff so

155
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:06,490
we got the bottom line 103 tests so
we're going to talk about this is the

156
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,090
degree of things

157
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:22,129
everyone every just like things are all
remaining three weeks is this more stuff

158
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,080
that we don't care about and then
another button says go get a free to go

159
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,480
but that's an extreme all of our at CES
outgoing mail server settings in our DNS

160
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:39,070
server verifies it for you and then you
get to see you know wait a minute does

161
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,080
he just goes into accused around 45
minutes then she's out approved mike is

162
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,379
a real labor

163
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:53,159
automated it happens when you get this
and we're happy so we have verified

164
00:19:53,159 --> 00:20:01,750
email we can send your outgoing mail
server got that email client gay so

165
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,809
typically in my dreams I will send email
I don't know it seems is you can send it

166
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:16,149
to send mail sendmail writes that sweet
do you like that you can automate this

167
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:23,350
entire process yes it's both pretty
sensitive APIC expose the enemies you

168
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,428
want and then it just typical but it'll
destroy everything you compose email it

169
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:33,370
take a little bit of coding but not able
to use your Gmail client BBEdit external

170
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:41,439
demand of the Gmail climb before yes so
it's hard but there's plenty of houses

171
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,980
on that so I can go into the details
about all sorts of reasons

172
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,400
outgoing mail server to my to exceed

173
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:57,270
to look back on that one degrees a
couple settings and something given to

174
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:04,660
you for all the good stuff to me and
then you're gonna read so just bounce

175
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,540
about this outgoing mail server that
would be insecure so we have to consider

176
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:16,810
yes my crabs crabs they're long they're
gross just talking a senior client

177
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:24,520
before the race is going well server
configured

178
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:52,820
I don't know there's always one male
just stay with us an email as well I see

179
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:00,879
a lot of times now claims it easy to
configure that's good news for us we're

180
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,540
doing now

181
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:13,240
ok so Van Dyke today my last last I got
nothin no time like this in the bag so I

182
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,790
like doctor who really doesn't have
doctor what's the one with Vincent van

183
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,409
Gogh and you'll be hooked for life

184
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,530
seasons

185
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:40,360
since 2006 we're gonna try to fool our
users so we want to establish some trust

186
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,300
these are the components and essentially
creates insurgency is a sound like a

187
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:53,530
marketing you know they want else yes so
again

188
00:22:53,530 --> 00:23:04,190
little marking and then sports just
example he was abused the path so I've

189
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:11,700
got some highlights there soon read on
the status of trust so buildings and

190
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,930
such a Klein buildings building security
in a very important action required

191
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:37,370
emails and you start my paragraph as you
know the new building and I know this

192
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:45,800
because of you so we've got called
action please login and the blue box

193
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,649
there and on specific company they
wonder about these

194
00:23:52,650 --> 00:24:05,750
now available secret you may or may not
know people are vain selfish one of them

195
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,130
so it's only got their first go-round
about page updated cycle thing uprooted

196
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,810
update your photo of the new one and
then we need to emergency so we're going

197
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:25,050
to make sure you take care of this by
noon today now I don't know that are

198
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,280
conducting investigations you may or may
not know this but there's a long tail to

199
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,550
the city so you got to grab this kind of
like a ramp up and then it keeps a

200
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,220
little while to get people to get people
but by the end of today and it drops off

201
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:46,540
and of course 5 o'clock nothing but then
Monday around people that I don't know

202
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,340
if they did see the email on Friday of
the traveling and didn't work but all

203
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:59,850
getting all get credentials up to 14 11
days after the engagement so they were

204
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:09,500
on a training partner that this is fake
but his email that I use now this was

205
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:17,110
more but I'm basing was the end of the
year to December engagement so who isn't

206
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,580
worried about the health care it's
changing things are moving in the

207
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,679
usually ends up in a higher price so we
set up

208
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,470
nice-guy company website so you can
learn about health care and how it could

209
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,280
affect you

210
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:42,820
demystified you changed your health care
plan so we r selfish and trust and then

211
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,450
called acts and login learn about your
health care if you don't even care

212
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:54,190
everyone must login to at least confirm
next year's average of my hands are tied

213
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:02,030
so and the other thing in the green box
bottom make sure that your changes are

214
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,280
going to adversely affect your premiums
are lower

215
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,700
they're going to get so long against
teams and then we've got a link there

216
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,520
and then of course the signature SVP of
a jar which do you expect to get this

217
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,090
room by the way sometimes I meet people
and I send the ads in social situations

218
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,360
and it does tend to get a little
something like the person that you maybe

219
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:42,199
pick there something I don't know but I
results of the minutes anyway good times

220
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,480
good times

221
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:52,560
verify right that's ok so now we have to
have a server to run he seems once we

222
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,139
have our email server we are outgoing
server were you trying to figured we got

223
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,760
to be able to have users somewhere else
right now there's lots of different

224
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:13,440
engagement types you can now where is it
at its website then delivers malware

225
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,340
what I like to do because now where
would you like to see them out where

226
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:27,699
nobody nobody the next series and nobody
wants to see this message back doors and

227
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:37,990
things happen and this is my third
method do whatever he wants so this is

228
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,420
just an appreciating the sides I give
you a special set of slides for the palm

229
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:51,300
prints were you can obtain them in my
right someone in slides they look

230
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,070
different from my slides where they have
a little more instruction that it does

231
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:08,419
it really exciting on the screen like
this site you can work through so proud

232
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,510
and so you can call on those anyway

233
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:20,960
decision to choose for setting up a
Linux p.m. in your interview us again

234
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,870
this is also gonna fall under the age of
yes documentation to really good at

235
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,699
documenting all these things how do I
want to set up an Ubuntu instance ok

236
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,650
here the steps they're really good at
that

237
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:37,520
billion to cover here but it's a couple
of guys changed

238
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:46,310
and if you're less technical get your I
teaching to help you and say hey you

239
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:54,580
know don't make create a team that still
see you need to make this successful

240
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,840
gave you need to make sure everything's
good race 2 billion somebody that's cool

241
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:09,740
maybe less technical either way to get
some particularly devious you think

242
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:16,140
they'd be good extracting emails and
great bring them in but don't tell if

243
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,460
your company only has 10 people you
might be good on your own button get a

244
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,270
team together

245
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,840
leverage other people's interests and
they're still sense

246
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,500
creating an Amazon Linux instance and
we've given IP address that we can

247
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,730
remote to it and this is a DNS settings
for the tobacco industry and give the IP

248
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,320
address to your DNS that used to be DNS
took like I don't know hundred million

249
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:57,260
years to update it was like 72 hours
sitting outside in seconds

250
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:09,440
domain it was like a record I do you
dress you just gave to your Amazon

251
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,750
instance

252
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,270
go by and that your domain info so
whatever the Republic nothing yet

253
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,820
because we haven't started yet to be
like actors in the movie yes

254
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:34,720
underwhelming response seen advertised
ok now those you seen hackers

255
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:43,680
if you didn't like it had ok so this
movie came out in 2005 the junior in

256
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:50,230
high school and it was awesome I sound
like a hundred times its initial release

257
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:57,230
anyway so answer to social engineering
toolkit which is anybody in here watch

258
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,870
the show mister Roboto

259
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:09,860
amusing sign in yes super cool tool
written by Dave Kennedy super cool guys

260
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,340
don't follow on Twitter you see a good
guy from speaking many many times just

261
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,300
just a nice down to walk up to him have
a conversation with them

262
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,200
called the social engineering toolkit
down this doesn't seem to like these

263
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,050
things

264
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:32,110
day has spent his time making things
easy for us ok so there's a few options

265
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,340
in there and again they'll be in the
slides that you'll be able to grab this

266
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,629
is a tool of sight is a command-line
tool

267
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:45,780
don't be scared just a number for the
menu item like it super easy still

268
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:52,940
amazes me about Dave Kennedy this
version happen to be called Mr Roboto

269
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,030
being on the show that he's cool so
number one really good social

270
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:06,440
engineering attacks have called things
you can get a spare hours just look at

271
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,760
all the different things that second do
it's cool I think you miserable to send

272
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,200
SMS messages directly to the back in
setup looks like on that but there's a

273
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,210
lot of something to do is make websites
so we're gonna social engineering

274
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,480
attacks and then we're going to website
actuators back to specific website

275
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:38,680
people but criticism so 11 enter to
enter three enter the complex I can tell

276
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:46,540
you the critics harvester attack three
answer to into a real estate in going on

277
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,740
sorry there was no number four but

278
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,800
123 so now there were here

279
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:02,370
website great so let's pretend we're
gonna put the IP address for our server

280
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,439
but we just set up and then we're gonna
put into your own URL to clone yeah

281
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,809
that's pretty cool it will just go out

282
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,570
scrape the site where you I'm using the
Google login here never logged into

283
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,820
Google ever

284
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:25,939
yes everyone has a lot of companies

285
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,770
other companies assume you because we're
gonna grab those who insist on that

286
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:45,210
website just for example website login
website or BBS engagement

287
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:52,670
black as a company logo this exactly
like their company login same here and

288
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:59,860
that's the fake one and I thought to
tell because it looks the same to go

289
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,479
through a web page and then like did you
get whatever the recursive command is

290
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:14,899
where is it and then grab all the goods
right images JavaScript it just doesn't

291
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,830
seem like easy things so it's pretty
legit right so my credit of course

292
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:29,449
there's the crabs and there they pop out
and say that

293
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:41,848
applause and 33 minutes for me
explaining how to do this by the way

294
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:50,649
when you just do it doesn't take as long
to financials reindeer games the hearts

295
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:55,899
of once so there is a little bit of a
hand waving but once you put in that

296
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:04,770
that cites 7 docs out soon command here
on webserver story you like it just does

297
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:12,780
it goes and then it is important et and
then you've got this login page that

298
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,430
system automatically and then its
potentials a gradstein posts from that

299
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,680
site on your server displays them in
line here and you can see the bottom

300
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,009
when your fancy control CDs generate a
report so you can get the report about

301
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:34,920
your friends that you did and you can
see that we're going ok we're gonna go

302
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,640
into that so that makes them easy

303
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:51,020
equals goodness in order to slide image
of the corners this is the focus our SMB

304
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:58,290
notice of Sciences but said after school
cars coming out from so so so the other

305
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:04,420
things you can do so that done you just
put a bow on it right now reports and

306
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,190
management collect money from them
because they want to do this more annual

307
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,760
training right they're going to want to
do that

308
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,810
so the next couple things a second
engagement you want to get a little bit

309
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:33,180
more of your game right i mean anything
over that can use the proper what's

310
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:42,940
their second is a patsy do it so you can
pick lines give you a previous life its

311
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:50,670
server it's all the same to the user is
going to the day afterwards I typically

312
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:56,740
like to do things like patsy

313
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:05,299
using patsy I use internet access across
the nation but not much to do with the

314
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,600
ruski web serves money so very little
consideration to get up and running yeah

315
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:20,779
it's easier than a passing but 72 patsy
for you so you can use different web

316
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:26,800
server wherever the thing about SAT is
it will grab that website today scraped

317
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,200
off the login page it'll save it for you
can also see the PPT file that handles

318
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,339
the POST request the data coming in and
then what does it redirects the user

319
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,980
back to the legitimate login

320
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:46,750
so the user sees they go with their
credentials in there you get them and

321
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,140
then they get redirected back to the
login page that's legitimate so they

322
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,700
think something's wrong in seabright was
right side

323
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:00,460
everything's going fine until I guess
that's fine I still get emails for

324
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:11,020
supporting an active member but it's
getting gas without getting what you

325
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,020
want you can use a web server you can
also add as a cell login pages

326
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:26,880
everyone's right to it or not but
psychiatric but common Komodo Kamado

327
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:34,090
nice-guy komodo they will give you a
free tell us if you get for 90 days free

328
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:40,510
domain that you come up with the website
so that's a link so that's what I

329
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:49,450
usually use 39 days hopefully the United
still getting emails but maybe a couple

330
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,750
things you can do to kind of game in the
second and third time and keep it up

331
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,990
keep doing the quarterly thing

332
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:02,319
running engagement once a quarter if you
can get if you can convince management

333
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,010
to do it twice a year something like
that make it really easy for them to say

334
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:13,350
yes so the reason I support charges
never tried to grass cutting grass on

335
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:22,000
the report and Anna training as well so
we're talking about that so who cares

336
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:31,450
it's so funny and so do the same done so

337
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,180
questions for management case of what
what can we do best success we have a

338
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,390
bitch engagement case of Morse's users
and/or melissa's Packers could deliver

339
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,480
malware but we talked about earlier

340
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,280
anywhere from local compromise to never
compromise when so many cats and they're

341
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,750
just hitting a network and only thing
that's the fire truck showing and then

342
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,390
the new truck every time

343
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:04,140
ok once they're there it's the server
data availability just hang out right

344
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:14,129
how many breaches last seven days not
many K usually go on for months and

345
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,790
months before the attack did I think the
average is like I want to say it's like

346
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,210
90 days or worse back me up on that

347
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:33,369
2393 days that's longer than three
months down I get a better 293 days the

348
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:35,620
average three so that's a problem

349
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:49,630
to back that is critical they could walk
in the external resources that have to

350
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:55,150
do anything to CVS air right it's an
email get financials are you no longer

351
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,840
have persuaded you share your opinions
with others

352
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,890
ok this is an example of a malware link
download it seems legit wright also

353
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:14,299
dates one tattoo me now is obviously did
and then helping us ko bhi is not on our

354
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,460
side and i wanna help us another have a
nice building in Utah County you will

355
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:29,610
get over here I'm sure you write this so
obviously minutes malicious PDFs are

356
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,600
paying hackers like those and others
like those bad guys like this he has

357
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,360
their help page this morning does not
necessarily mean this page or website is

358
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,370
harmful yes it does

359
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:52,000
never got a PDF got a legitimate PDF the
brand code inside of it nobody is

360
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,610
raising their hands nobody does this so
maybe you can submit a support ticket

361
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:06,550
for this video be so yes it's harmful
always bad and if it isn't bad don't

362
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:12,660
send it to something else there's
another way to comment saying goes

363
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,549
so we talked a little bit about this
already but how do we defend against you

364
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:17,780
seeing in spam

365
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:27,010
ok so yes sample the black box right
about self help you get rid of some of

366
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,720
the low-hanging fruit it can detect if
there is an email sent to hire companies

367
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,069
in the same address right maybe that's a
red flag so not a bad idea

368
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:42,720
box in this case not bad year

369
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:51,430
surprising that he didn't compete hear
it and they can be beaten by determining

370
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,288
factor to you again

371
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:58,440
get rid of the opportunity attackers
listen buddy how weightlessness gmail

372
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:17,960
balking at their decision like this so I
listing as hard as 100 K

373
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,710
so you can white less you can do it well

374
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:30,029
meeting rooms in otherwise difficult
somebody has to like call you on the

375
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:44,700
phone still no problem right to do you
know centers not bad if your environment

376
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,618
for static in the CD will email you a
controlled environment i cant being

377
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:55,529
taste testing and training is by far the
most of that way we make humans better

378
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,610
at detecting malicious things are
getting better at the

379
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:05,690
almost as things so we can teach them
what sort of bad luck ok has a padlock

380
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,870
deadlocks and still be ok to make sure
the domain is expected to be things

381
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:17,190
everyone in this room knows things that
may be too many chart does know like

382
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:25,730
Georgia me to do his job and one's
design and information i had a foul

383
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:32,920
words whatever last year so yeah

384
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:41,910
setting it can be hard to beat you
training in here at the organization how

385
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:49,600
many of you also do a nice i like it so
horrible could be worse that's even

386
00:44:49,600 --> 00:45:01,640
worse the size waist training fun that
make users interested in a couple of a

387
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,279
strategy that I've heard of our PC users
as if you're helping them just in

388
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,230
general though not necessarily to work
context but hey this is how you detect

389
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,040
this in any context at home at work you
can get your spouse and she's your

390
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,890
friends can teach our kids that kind of
thing the other is to have some sort of

391
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,770
reward who's the first person to

392
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:32,380
report this machine was Susie and you
know some sort of whatever department

393
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,900
really I guess here she gets a Snickers
bar spot in the front of the building to

394
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,270
park her car or she was mentioned in the
newsletter these things that weekend

395
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:50,310
easy or cheap and they help users to
realize that hey this is important and

396
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:58,370
it's kind of fun to be involved in it so
don't be like Brian don't keep your

397
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:03,330
plants in serious but then you come down
kissing put in $5 cheaper wiring or

398
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,100
whatever day makes it how the bases
covered

399
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:17,040
you running your engagement ring that
those inside your data training they are

400
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,800
able to say hey to get some real when
you sit in front of a group of people

401
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,490
you say this is what you guys did last
time we did this is what you've done

402
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:34,549
don't put individuals names on there but
these are just a day before was how many

403
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,550
people put in their credentials

404
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:44,020
it will help you I promise and social
engineering and fishing is the way that

405
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:50,910
compromises any questions

406
00:46:50,910 --> 00:47:13,710
yes

407
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:24,440
sometimes I have a 24 hour notice before
doing any good

408
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:34,000
yes I like having that time to formulate
an event website what was happening its

409
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,480
organization do they have announced on
their website and newsletter public and

410
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,300
look at those what's happening in the
future for this company

411
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,550
things you can use those and Taylor that
evil and inhuman towards being

412
00:47:46,550 --> 00:48:27,099
successful trick question

413
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:35,420
arrived too many things that are similar
and things that are up by one is that

414
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:41,369
we've seen by Ahn but in between binary
yeah that's a great suggestion for sure

415
00:48:41,369 --> 00:49:11,559
questions yes

416
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:19,979
how do I make sure it's Ryan Taylor my
approach to where Billy just seein say

417
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:27,459
the victim click on it which does happen
over time how seen that I don't see it

418
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:31,058
as often as I should see it if that
makes sense

419
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:36,239
usually on an email blast it's a fairly
I mean those companies are both you know

420
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,719
$1,500 employs 200 may not hit those
employees even hit two people sitting

421
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,799
next to each other so usually sample
size is the weighted apt our whole

422
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:52,359
organization I would say you have to
come up with a systematic plan to you

423
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,359
know what we're gonna hit ten people
from the Department of people in this

424
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,509
apartment today and then and hopefully
you can get an additional sample size

425
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:16,980
and kind of statues thing but yeah great
question

426
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:25,670
good thing it is a good metric it really
just comes down to what the engagement

427
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,470
looks like what are your goals

428
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,709
challenger goals before and you can
tailor all that but yeah I agree I agree

429
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,770
that is a good match and it seems to
last the whole thing I mean this

430
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:40,619
reportedly you can mix it up you can say
this time without having read this and

431
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,170
want to find out this did win this time

432
00:50:43,170 --> 00:51:07,310
tailored towards a yes

433
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:16,980
which is true so you may want to test if
you get up to run on the first game in

434
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:29,120
which I agree with so yeah definitely
becoming yes but the question was ever

435
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:35,870
used to mark records for its recording
and i havent today on candidates running

436
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:40,460
in tracking is and remember I like
things that are needy there's a plugin

437
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:47,960
for that were said she male called the
super weird name but it's the email to a

438
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,420
little image jobs or whatever but also
like to click track opens today and it's

439
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,760
like that you can do to get some free so
yeah that's pretty much for data

440
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:06,520
collection pretty reliable methods you
can also as a side note on I miss the

441
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,740
set design and see that the files
including the PHP and a couple things so

442
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:20,020
modifying their one it's a date stamp to
each post requests which is hard and if

443
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:28,970
in the end she to the code word it's
pretty straight forward to a timestamp

444
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,750
you have a few other things you clean up
the forms that doesn't pose all these

445
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:38,020
fields are usually just like a login
form so it wasn't easy to customize and

446
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,119
this is

447
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,940
hey you've got eight hours to an
Associated men go by so I just you know

448
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,910
I'm an extra susser and tested so I
don't necessarily get the time to hang

449
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:57,038
out on the inside and make this better I
just do it and I do it again they did

450
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,230
against though they're definitely
prevent on this and I've done nothing

451
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:05,480

straightforward stuff again get any
