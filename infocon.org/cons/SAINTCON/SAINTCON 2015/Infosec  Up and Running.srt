1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,170
back those it started ok first breakout
session in same con- who's excited ok

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:25,340
we're not here to do anything just
really ok

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:37,530
more than three times five times how
many guys have any more than 10 times we

4
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:50,800
got a couple great security analyst for
a fairly large summer nobody here in the

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,440
states however did just accept a new job
in the Bay Area and will be relocating

6
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:08,310
but I'll be coming back for me said they
counter sir so that so I am mandell 80

7
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,490
on Twitter I'm pretty active there

8
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,800
get ahold of me they're quick disclaimer
that anything I saying here does not

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,479
reflect the views of my employer any
other organization you guys are

10
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,970
obtainable Riley books do you guys so
ripped off their title the title the

11
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,539
bigger up and running Dr up and running
and so in order to have a ton of books

12
00:01:33,539 --> 00:03:55,560
without naming scheme named my talk is
an InfoSec up and running

13
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:45,290
million personnel shortage supposedly
right that industry is growing at 3.65%

14
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:53,320
and the average salary of security
software 233,000 ok

15
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,150
how many guys doing those numbers are
super high and totally inaccurate

16
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,780
work of a source of hope there's a next
flight but it's a little bit in

17
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,140
perspective we're gonna get this is a
number of registered nurses is coming

18
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,260
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
registered nurse is a few it's very high

19
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,480
in demand as well as if so there are
currently about 2.7 million registered

20
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,770
nurses in the United States 90% the
average salary of $65,000 thats coming

21
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,289
straight from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics right now let's take a look

22
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,050
at these numbers again what do that so
it's right there

23
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:49,710
can anybody say that I know super tiny
tits ESO ESO eso does

24
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,370
accepts a for-profit information
security publication and so it is

25
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,180
totally in their favor they publish
these numbers in their favor to publish

26
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,480
skews the numbers like these right so
you're going to hear a lot if you're

27
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,300
just getting into that you're going to
hear you're gonna hear ridiculous

28
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,410
numbers like these all the time what
some of them may be accurate

29
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:21,400
more accurate than others don't do that
however let's look at the real numbers

30
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,469
that visit anyway so we're gonna look at
the real numbers registered nurses name

31
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,400
for second was the registered nurse
numbers are blue and red

32
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,169
number of positions open their 2.7
million road sooner than 75,000 in the

33
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,659
second analysts just security analyst
this was the only security related

34
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,210
position I could find on the Bureau of
Labor Statistics website right and it's

35
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:56,989
very possible on being a whole lot more
than just analysts and industry growth

36
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:04,620
rate 37% so that was actually fairly
accurate coming from CSO on right that

37
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,960
is huge

38
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,840
the national average is like an aside
the exact national average but I know

39
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,280
it's less than half that right there in
the industry growth rate for registered

40
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,309
nurses is above the national average
right so that is a huge huge growth rate

41
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,100
right there

42
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,840
the average salary for analyst is more
like 86,000 not doing it 33,000 however

43
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,698
definitely possible depending on where
you would have to be getting to make

44
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,550
that one should have expected definitely
not unheard of

45
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,409
right

46
00:07:36,409 --> 00:08:26,339
so now that we don't wanna addresses is
getting formed right there are a ton of

47
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:34,059
different sources online that you can
use to become more informed about what's

48
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:42,989
going on in the Investec world day on
reddit

49
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,970
I know there's a couple of years out
there

50
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:55,259
check out our newest should definitely
check out our now there's a lot of other

51
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:00,480
info second separated out there a lot of
people like a lot of people do research

52
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,300
and then a blogger or a white paper
whatever and impose that on Arnott's it

53
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:18,660
is one of the most it continuously has
great great great sources and the great

54
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,500
thing is that its community driven
people are since the meeting between

55
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,689
themselves

56
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:35,579
you're not on reddit it should be
leaving guys look at the difference in

57
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:43,519
the sector vessels in 1928 is amazing we
shoot in the end of that community

58
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,290
everybody who's doing research

59
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,129
big-name professionals they're on
they're literally might might mean new

60
00:09:53,129 --> 00:10:00,170
source for Twitter my eye I also have an
RSS feeds are gonna be touching on here

61
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,819
in a second but twitter has become my
main source of info section news just

62
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:07,240
because so many people are tweeting
about this stuff right

63
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,160
not only that it is a great place to
network right people that are doing the

64
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,689
same type of thing that you're you're
doing working on projects meet up with

65
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,170
them on Twitter

66
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:31,579
elaborate build something together some
of them from that working on so it does

67
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,160
the job that I just accepted came from
networking networking on Twitter

68
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,529
RSS RSS feeds it seems like everybody
these days as a security block getting

69
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:51,660
over my favorites in a second but
subscribe to blog even if you're not

70
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,969
reading everything in the bloggers in a
blog post article or or whatever it is

71
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:05,110
just so you can get an idea what's going
on here the head literally like I have

72
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,649
probably thirty RSS feeds of my CD
accounts every morning I just go through

73
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,730
the headlines right and also read the
ones that really interests me but

74
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,889
they're just going to the headlines of
enter my Twitter feed and are you are

75
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:24,430
not sick are usually have a fairly good
idea and and knowing what's going on it

76
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,819
and information security right

77
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:37,840
the screenshot of darkness a credit to
the top on right they're attacking Ruby

78
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,610
on Rails applications that somebody
white paper and you go and look at it

79
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,520
and do it yourself that's a that's one
thing that I love about the investment

80
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:53,380
community is that it's so very very open
and people are are costly publishing

81
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,530
what they're doing what they're working
on and you can go right and learn from

82
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:04,740
what they've already done this is a good
friend of mine blog nor secure and he's

83
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,830
constantly ready and suggestions and and
publishing them onto this blog gets a

84
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,890
lot of attention for thats wired speed
wired threat level and security RSS feed

85
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:24,880
is great i like wired because they tend
to keep things accurate and how I mean

86
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,560
every publication since its use them
being there too in my mind the job Krebs

87
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,680
on security

88
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,189
he's kind of freedom in the Investec
community right but whether you live in

89
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,770
Murrieta my I don't think there's any
denying that he's a really great

90
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:50,300
journalist he does really really really
really great investigative work and

91
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,630
often will break stories before anybody
else gods he did actually just didn't

92
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,550
AMA and has anything on reddit just a
couple days ago and in that email he

93
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,899
talked about how he specifically works
for stories that he know no one else has

94
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:13,589
a lead on yet and that cecilia is
journalism right but it also makes his

95
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:22,770
reads very very interesting right we had
a huge fridge for a job reaching here to

96
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:29,610
back right and he was the first one the
broken about it some stuff like that he

97
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,970
he just wrote books damnation because
this is one of my favorites malware must

98
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,540
die this is a super technical blog and
we're at what they do is they have it on

99
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,230
the internet

100
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,810
they don't get mad get attacked all day
long and what they do is they reverse

101
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:56,910
engineer the mount where they see on
their right as far as intelligence goes

102
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,959
is actually pretty solid they they know
what they're talking about

103
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:13,079
they know English as a second language
there but they are several times asked

104
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
questions

105
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,589
super great guys willing to help out if
you don't understand how I would

106
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,980
definitely be if you will get into
getting our analysis check out that

107
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,350
bloggers sure I'm sure you'll violence
is also one of my favorites also little

108
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,230
more technical Adam Langley this is his
blog he works for Google those creatures

109
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:40,120
have here is he's going in so chrome has
recently did Google's recently ditched

110
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,740
OpenSSL completely and they used for
itself which is an airport give OpenSSL

111
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,490
rate and in here he technically explains
why Google made the decision to do that

112
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,790
great win total hits he went into a very
technical analysis

113
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:03,130
the bootable ability and then explain
exactly why it works like that he

114
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,240
doesn't often but when he does it really
really great stuff

115
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,140
the response is one of my very favorite
suspect this is a great one of your

116
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:21,310
decision here going into announces type
work this guy like I think you currently

117
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,160
work for Microsoft Excel intelligence
for them and he's been doing security

118
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,939
announces support for years or decades
you know the stuff he is also one that

119
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,930
doesn't post super super frequently
however when he does it's over it's

120
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:43,449
always make sure that this is just a few
of my favorites like to listen to

121
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,150
podcasts on your way to work

122
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:51,410
audio books or whatever they may be
easier 35 I would recommend maybe not

123
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,040
necessarily listening to him every
single week right but they're definitely

124
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:02,069
great resources together with some
security week we normally calm

125
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:09,650
sued over that they had changed through
weekly these days do is they usually put

126
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,980
that to the weekend it one show the
interviewer security professional

127
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,460
security expert in which that expert
talks about the research that they're

128
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,320
doing what they're trying to accomplish
in their field one not a lot of those

129
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,590
interviews are super interesting once
they had on it I'm waiting on our

130
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,760
neighbor once they had a girl that was a
really really good at post forensic

131
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,680
specific breed and it was one of my
favorite talks interview that they've

132
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,729
done with the risky business

133
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,350
wanted to view this guy he's a
journalist from Australia and he'll have

134
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,320
and what he does is he goes through the
security stories that have broken in the

135
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,640
past week and he has informed you on
what's going on he also typically does

136
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,160
big names on there such as Alex
democrats are Brad Arkin how it says the

137
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,329
CSO

138
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:15,668
formally it's Yahoo now for Facebook CSO
for Adobe security weekly the second

139
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,610
point out that I imagine they also go
through the stories together about the

140
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,428
has broken through the week

141
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:26,490
these are seriously like an hour so long

142
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,799
super easy to give a listen on your way
to work to and from work right or while

143
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,809
you're going along that's what I do but
there's also a lot of really good audio

144
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,149
books out there that I would recommend

145
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:47,500
listen to their internets Arts Center's
Avery storm cast is really good for

146
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,289
those that are constantly involved in
active threats I've never seen this

147
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,429
podcast over 10 minutes mom and it's
usually about five minutes what it is is

148
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:05,210
every weekday stands at the Institute
they release this explaining

149
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,169
new potential threats and
vulnerabilities at the David Wright so

150
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:15,110
this is a really good one it takes five
minutes to get the update on what's

151
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,840
going on in the world

152
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:28,289
a question so far so good to talk a
little bit about education and as I said

153
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:39,320
this is a controversial topic how many
guys have ever felt like this they want

154
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:55,620
to hear in this mean

155
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:05,570
bility it was expose in the back in
Linux right and it's huge

156
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,490
allowed to remote code execution and the
ending

157
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,700
percent of summer but it is insane

158
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,110
percent of the internet's was completely
vulnerable to it and the resulting about

159
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,120
sell stock is that it's not like it's
like if you're vulnerable to it maybe

160
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,159
it'll work like some of these
vulnerabilities and exploits are if

161
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,130
you're vulnerable to shell shocked it
will work great in a lot of people of

162
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,309
when this hits everybody was all the
values we should use its red worms

163
00:19:36,309 --> 00:20:24,399
viruses and everything like everybody
was getting the right medicine

164
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,810
that's what I'm doing my CISSP right the
CISSP the great circular a lot of stuff

165
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,870
right but just because you have it
doesn't mean that you are security

166
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:43,830
experts see the certifying body of CISSP
has done a really good marketing job so

167
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,389
which has resulted in the fact that he
charge that's that's pretty much the

168
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,800
premier certification but they look for
an IT professionals to kind of get your

169
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,399
foot in the door with a job that's why I
asked that not just sort of all the

170
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:06,100
great certification you learn a lot
right so certifications can definitely

171
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,530
help you get your foot in the door
that's why I'm talking talking about

172
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,780
them here

173
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,899
security plus if you have no experience
and certainly insecurity is a great

174
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,990
security certification if you're looking
for an entry level job I would highly

175
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,070
recommend I think professor Messer view
Google him or her to look them up on

176
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:35,720
YouTube he has no recourse they take to
get ready for your security plus great

177
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,180
great right from there you guys did this
service is referencing the Microsoft

178
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,300
security cert

179
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,510
know if you're looking for the door and
looking for an entry level job with

180
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:55,900
Microsoft Security also great sir yeah
good questions about certifications okay

181
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:04,370
cool so so we had a couple susan here
it's a great way to get your foot in the

182
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,939
door

183
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,950
school so I haven't agreed I T and
actually before I started my degree and

184
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,100
I had no experience in nineteen other
than what I did around with the whole

185
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:25,300
right and my degree speak rate really
gives an entry level position I got its

186
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:32,520
position just a couple months after a TV
even sort of program right that's a

187
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,720
really good example of how schools can
get you can get UN also the job that I

188
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,840
just accepted they would not have hired
me how did not have the right

189
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:50,860
degrees are super important however also
that being said I work with a couple of

190
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:57,570
guys who do not have degrees and they
are to the right and also to the best

191
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,200
ever worked with

192
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,540
right so very important not absolutely
necessary but if you don't have

193
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,240
experience for you looking to expand
your horizon and your knowledge

194
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,560
definitely a good option for sure and as
we were talking about how the industry

195
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:22,220
is growing at a rate of 37% that's crazy
right is not gonna be there's not going

196
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,400
to be enough guys that have enough
experience to get by without a degree

197
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,380
right with the industry growing it that
fast right so education ever

198
00:23:34,380 --> 00:24:00,910
increasingly important BYU and the you
have a graduate program in 10 workers

199
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,800
working on a speech T

200
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:10,830
in Johns Hopkins and information
security right in a couple of streets

201
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,830
that you'll see that I simply makes
friends with your professors that

202
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,790
doesn't mean brown noser professors at
making friends with your professors will

203
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,080
pay off the current job but I have
because I impressive my professor who is

204
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,139
now the box right before that so I was
offered a job from another professor did

205
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:40,840
it as a team that won but she was also
press for me job I say that because it's

206
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,090
a good example of how these educational
programs can help you with networking

207
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,149
help you get your foot in the door help
you get it didn't help you get a career

208
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:57,110
the current job that I have a lot of
time I went I work with an awesome team

209
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,560
I do i mean analyst writes I'm
constantly looking at attacks coming

210
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,159
into our infrastructure and it's a black
and i never would be able to do that I

211
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,730
hadn't

212
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,400
had a good relationship with my
professor and worked hard in my classes

213
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:20,600
right so again just because you have a
PHD though doesn't mean that you can

214
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,429
tell that you're an expert in any way

215
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:31,030
conferences

216
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,490
thank you did you are you doing it with
them

217
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,860
awesome I did not know that baby so much
so that this mother next 2016 is a full

218
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,729
on matters that last year so Southern
Utah University verily will have a full

219
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:53,790
blown masters in information security
all these are great schools they really

220
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,970
are we have great programs

221
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:10,970
conferences guys are gonna do you any
good con man down black at any given day

222
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:20,160
b-sides and it whether it's SLC deceive
biggest whatever we're here it's a con

223
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:28,160
there's of compromise its I have an RSS
feed him i Keatley that constantly all

224
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:36,070
the dates for conferences and it amazes
me how many pizzas every day right so

225
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,260
really popular ones besides definite
Blackadder should have gone to work on a

226
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,760
coworker that with a large Khan and
sailors recently they're all over the

227
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,250
place

228
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,890
the great thing about the one of my
favorite person to be cezanne's great

229
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,700
thing about besides they're typically
either free or super cheap right

230
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,919
and they often will run like student
discounts right and it's a very easy to

231
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:17,570
get into the concentrates I I had a
blast besides SLC secretary right it's

232
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,639
more than likely if you're interested in
security in your ear and idk I just idk

233
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:28,889
I apologize we're gonna get in their
information security and your employer's

234
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:34,590
on board it's very likely that they will
pay for security conference right now so

235
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,889
definitely worth a try

236
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:43,860
is a great especially the bigger one
where officials are doing big-time

237
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,389
research huge resources making new
discoveries will present their ideas

238
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:50,729
there

239
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:59,650
is also a lot of retraining online there
is the here couple of examples how many

240
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,400
guys have you ever used in securities
trading down into sound super super

241
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,970
popular but it is free and they have
literally taken the time to record

242
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:19,850
courses on various information security
training right I was I was looking at

243
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,750
one and the other day that I'm
particularly interested malware analysis

244
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,700
right when I was looking at one and they
do have a couple of courses in malware

245
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:36,910
down since I write another one is in a
sensor network security monitoring and

246
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:43,160
they have been working of super hard
lately to publish YouTube videos and

247
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,700
trainings for network security
monitoring software solutions such as

248
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:59,270
turcotte its bro and out sex stuff like
this you can use to set up an idea they

249
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,160
saw a need that there wasn't a ton of
free training out there i mean there

250
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,110
there's a lot of training going in the
degree you go get since reading but we

251
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:13,310
understand screening and super expensive
right you can do all these things but

252
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,820
there is a huge shortage free open
available sources for network security

253
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,230
monitoring out there and they've been
working this late almost a whole year

254
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:28,710
2015 to bring these to you so you just
google open NSM website is opened a gash

255
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:34,390
in its network security monitoring .
Mets you can find links to the YouTube

256
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:41,860
page and the rates they there bro
concert is specific is especially

257
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,490
particularly good and rose one of my
very favorite tools they use of work

258
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:54,110
every single day many questions I'm sure
there's a lot more other reserves or

259
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,990
resources of retraining online this is
just the first two that I have

260
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:05,310
experience with so I decided this up
here but there are tons of books out

261
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,190
there to know started books so rightly

262
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:17,460
another publisher suback OC there's a
ton of texts publishers out there

263
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,210
they're really really really really
great content in their books I have had

264
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:28,940
a lot of value just going through those
folks doing the labs I'm gonna talk

265
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,850
about to specifically you're coming up
doing laps in the books on my own and I

266
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,649
just had my employers usually have the
money for the book is it still in like

267
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:43,668
20 bucks right and even if I had to show
myself and be willing to concede

268
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:51,220
30 40 bucks that much right definitely
worth the economy to get out of that ok

269
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,650
so

270
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,620
the stock was largely inspired by a talk
given by rob jordan says he has a Rob he

271
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:06,800
gave it a Visa card info sectors doing
it I'm totally having him it copying him

272
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,149
in the stock which inspired me and I
wanted to do the same type of things

273
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,530
here because I saw the need I thought
there was a lot of guys trying to get

274
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:23,740
into security at a good price the sooner
than I wish I had a little bit more

275
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,500
guidance when I was first looking into
in Denver second one so point that I

276
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:39,370
wanna make is just do it right just like
Nike says make it a hobby been one of my

277
00:31:39,370 --> 00:32:28,739
favorite scenes

278
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,830
I'm a bad example of this but this is
how I make time for some I'm married

279
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,960
with two kids and i know im at work all
day when I get home and I spend

280
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,210
I spent a couple hours of my girls
before they go down and then I have a

281
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,630
couple hours of my wife and then usually
about 10 minutes for like three or four

282
00:32:49,630 --> 00:33:00,830
five six hours doing something that I
want to view i sat on the internet

283
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,149
looking good right now where is that in
itself like that I've also recently been

284
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:12,900
engaged by the private projects that
dealing with now we're in open source

285
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,090
intelligence and something that and yeah
a lot of all nighters so that I

286
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,050
personally make time for my favorite
hobby and I do that fairly often average

287
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,220
color

288
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:33,490
five hours of sleep terrible so no
familiar with Python programming

289
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:42,460
language if you're not learn it you will
use it every single day in your career

290
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,940
and even if even if you're not looking
good enough for second year here and I T

291
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,730
or or or whatever it may be I i use this
all the time when I was mighty to rate

292
00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:04,030
you will use it all the time as rates
these are the two books that I use only

293
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:13,270
but if you look very specific user to
great books by the same guy just in seat

294
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,859
I'm sorry if I totally butchered that
last name but black on black python is

295
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:24,418
more geared towards interests are geared
more towards now we're in what's right

296
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,179
but despite your going to do whatever
your gonna do it if you will benefit

297
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,480
another really good one at a time when I
also really like it's fine with Python

298
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,699
by teaching o'connor I think that's the
other it's a little more dated but it

299
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,960
but the principles

300
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:52,168
in the book is awesome definitely
recommend any questions on Python or

301
00:34:52,168 --> 00:35:00,680
anything like that so far ok so so this
is a bad idea that I mostly wanted to

302
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,990
convey that I've been in several job
interviews where I've been and I've been

303
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,490
the one interviewing rather than me want
cool the one being interviewed and

304
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,680
interviewed candidates but you can tell
are really passionate about it and you

305
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,359
could tell there are also countless more
see it as a job and it is the difference

306
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,029
is very blatant and we tend to hire the
ones that are a lot more passionate

307
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,270
about it the ones are passionate about
it are the ones that just go out there

308
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,700
and they do it they see something we
want to do and they do it right they see

309
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,210
something on Twitter they see something
I read it they see something say

310
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:47,099
something like that is super cool how
did you do it or they find this blog

311
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,940
they want to upset by step they go and
do it like the people that take that

312
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,319
personal initiative will get hired over
the people that don't every single time

313
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,249
they really well it is just shows that
they're willing to learn they're willing

314
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:05,629
to work for what they are what they want

315
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:12,219
managers spectacular just a couple ideas
and i said im honey products it's a

316
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:16,229
really really easy deploy deploy anybody
out there on the internet and look at

317
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:19,218
the other traffic coming in the
different types of attacks from malware

318
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:29,180
stuff like that I gave a talk at City
Hall about 20 bucks I was going to give

319
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:37,410
another talk here about my honey pots
well but I'd scratch that we want to go

320
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:45,930
to set up a home idea this is super easy
security on dirrty onion is a great

321
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,339
distro get started with it if you're
interested in network security wondering

322
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,619
is that what it is it's based off
coupons 2 1204 they're working on

323
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:02,079
upgrading its portico quartet before
1600 comes out what it is is it has a

324
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,699
ton of open source network security
monitoring tools and his bro courts nor

325
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:18,469
be exact name anyway you can use all of
these you just gotta set up a network

326
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,569
type you can buy a network of throwing
star Network tab on line for 20 bucks

327
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:27,740
writing that works too

328
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,509
your boxes writing studio and is picking
up all your traffic right and you can

329
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:54,470
look and see what kind of a yes

330
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:11,098
so

331
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:24,150
you have to have a box with two nicks
right so what I've done is a Raspberry

332
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,589
Pi Day and I just body USB network and
one's picking up and down one's picking

333
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:35,190
up the outbound and there's a there's
another one they call this a pro and I

334
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:42,289
think the only difference is that some
clothes and they charge like $20 so yeah

335
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:45,789
he's a great time has special you're
working on a budget I mean it's better

336
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:51,619
when you're doing individual research
everybody right so but if the money and

337
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:56,239
you can buy it starts which they will do
it would be that definitely do it right

338
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,810
but that's that's my suggestion for you
that answer your question

339
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:07,640
no problem any other questions I was a
great question and answer the questions

340
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:14,980
I tend to go often set up a vulnerable
weather and break it don't break of

341
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,270
owner will of whether it's actually on
the internet is that the legal right to

342
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,970
set up your own vulnerable vulnerable
without its been busted do something

343
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,220
maybe not even a web application to set
up a Windows XP box is beyond the

344
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,069
Windows XP has done the vulnerabilities
and using Metasploit destroyers and

345
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,940
testing framework go ahead of you not
familiar with this amazing to see you to

346
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:52,430
act right there's there's a ton of
vulnerable web application that's

347
00:39:52,430 --> 00:40:04,049
another one that's been a popular damn
border web application do what you're

348
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:09,700
supposed to do with them break up
regular time participate in CT efforts

349
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,569
in bug bounties sensor capture the flag

350
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:19,900
that hackers challenge here at his
example what I can see what everybody

351
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,400
else ETF I that's actually might be in
my very favorite thing about this is

352
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:32,740
that CTS because wave or doing hands-on
stuff like that and I do sitting and

353
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,689
listening to docs.google.com valuable
right but I personally have a more hands

354
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:44,650
on learner a lot of company who knows
what the bug bounty program is for those

355
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,680
who don't know a lot of companies will
have a program where basically that made

356
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,250
you if you find a vulnerability in their
software their website or their portal

357
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:03,780
or whatever it may be right and they do
that to help make their make their

358
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,950
websites right if you participate in
these things are you will you will learn

359
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,970
that there's always a lot of the
conferences that are going on he say

360
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,750
that do sítio you don't necessarily
have to be a productive in the

361
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,520
conference and attendant at the
conference to participate I believe it

362
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,480
received on that is the case there are
tons of conferences all over the united

363
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,920
states all over the world but they let
anyone participate in the city after

364
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,970
right

365
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,750
fun to just get a bunch of parties that
are going on and trying to get out your

366
00:41:37,750 --> 00:42:11,859
stuff right right to applications

367
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:14,989
gonna learn a lot

368
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:23,079
doing it anyway right so around what
schools in Cali winnings wifi driver

369
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,220
ducky coming together ever heard of
these solutions Kelly Lenox Ave

370
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:42,118
interesting distribution of Linux
expenses are actually what I do is I

371
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,259
have a Raspberry Pi and there's a
distribution that goes on the Raspberry

372
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:47,990
Pi

373
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:54,569
blanking on the name here but it does
the exact same thing as why pineapple

374
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,780
wanna say it might be free buyers back
anyway

375
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,900
rubber ducky is it the USB K

376
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,830
drive that he looks like a USB driver
really when you put it in its recognized

377
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:13,700
by a computer keyboard and you can
execute code and whatnot and so

378
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,430
sensitive information for people
computers if you see something that you

379
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,910
think it's awesome I think it's a bit
like five times now if you see something

380
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,779
that interests you if you see something
that you don't quite understand do it

381
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:38,990
one thing that when I was reading it I T
C had absolutely no experience and so

382
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:45,020
what I did was a laptop and white 2012
on it and I force myself to use the

383
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:51,780
command-line everything right that's not
as a specific inputs but it's a good

384
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,350
example if you want to learn something
going to do it yourself if you see

385
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,660
something online that somebody did

386
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:05,940
it's super cool going to it if you are
sometimes it's it's it's human nature

387
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,609
and I'm definitely guilty of human
nature to trend by other people are

388
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:16,009
doing it they're making advances in
InfoSec word maybe like you have an idea

389
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:23,099
but then somebody Janet party ticket
right for instance I was trying to

390
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:28,940
develop in the middle of the development
of it I found out that somebody had

391
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,780
actually already developed that my exact
same idea right now my plan I'm not done

392
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,079
it may be a bad example my plan is to
reach out tonight developer and work

393
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,069
with him to make it better

394
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:43,160
right I don't want to let that keep me
from still be able to learn what I was

395
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,450
going to learn by doing what I wanted to
write so don't feel threatened by other

396
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:54,788
professionals don't feel threatened by
co-workers one thing that is awesome and

397
00:44:54,789 --> 00:45:00,829
we can learn from each other's mistakes
that makes sense

398
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:11,619
lines if you have any questions I will
