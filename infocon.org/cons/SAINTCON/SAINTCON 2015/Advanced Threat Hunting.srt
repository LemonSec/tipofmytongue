1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:39,890
are you going here

2
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,230
so today

3
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,078
prepared is originally had a lot of
different PowerPoint slides going but it

4
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,120
is 10 a.m. so I figured I'd do a little
bit of a console demo as well for carbon

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,649
black rhino and fall asleep on me

6
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:00,170
restructure perspective I am bridge
luckily I've been with Kyra black and

7
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,290
midnight for about two years now a
little over two years actually it today

8
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,950
and we'll be talking about advanced
hunting so typically though in the past

9
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,180
when it comes to preventing people focus
me in the eye detection right black is a

10
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,860
bit different and really it's because of
my state should be changed to collection

11
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,810
rather than just simply detection by
prioritizing election over to Jackson

12
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,380
you do a lot of other stuff out there
right you can have more effectively

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,070
designed root cause very quickly which
is the most important part in my opinion

14
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,330
reconstructed time lines of what
happened so you don't just you know C

15
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,360
one portion of the pieces to kill chain
has everyone in marking those calls it

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,310
the rather ignore galli back to how it
could deliver to my environment how did

17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,850
it happen to accelerate that in an
obviously in the next step is IRC we

18
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,830
strive for security model so make sure
that doesn't happen again

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,759
because it shows really what people
suffering from an investigation

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,130
respected by focusing on the jewish
focus just great I have an alert

21
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,320
something bad happened hopefully my
network security SEC's top it whenever

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,000
they see what I should be seeing which
is below the fold the water in this case

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,370
you don't continue to collect data focus
on detection rather this recollection

24
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,100
rather than detection to take a lot
longer to find abnormal behavior defying

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,040
two lateral movement do you search has
been created a struggle it's going to be

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,650
a lot harder to find extra trees as well
because everyone in here should know

27
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,300
this can know it's bad ahead of time so
if you're only focusing on certain to

28
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,410
collect that information

29
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,220
something bad happens when you gonna
miss the majority of taxes especially

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,270
advance tax so where some things that
you know you should be looking for that

31
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,270
you can really only do if you'd like
everything practically things like

32
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:12,420
normal user accounts being use these
else SEC who is running under trees

33
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,250
parent or running order a stranger
context like system is Internet Explorer

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,800
Acrobat Word notepad all those wonderful
security code of programs be used to spy

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,650
on cell processes

36
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,630
office ever making outbound connection
is just wanna come and sales center

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,890
excedrin was on my walk to the console
to show you how you know my keys car

38
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,589
black guys help me do this

39
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:51,040
you don't have to really so you know I
recording every command line into a

40
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,000
recording including alerted to whatever
netday excuse me here and AC and power

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,569
shows being used power still obviously
is extremely powerful a recording that

42
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,869
or you just waiting for someone to tell
you that something bad happened after

43
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:11,110
our children and the list goes on and on
as you can imagine the scores of hunting

44
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,579
tips affairs who neglect the right data
rate your printer defense W NetFlow you

45
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,350
firewalls can give you some data but
that's not what the activities have been

46
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,900
somebody attacks happening you text
happening on the employee seriously when

47
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,130
I saw it I went to a lot of enterprises
was their firewall log on the network

48
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,659
out here larry to security event and
then all they had to go off of was some

49
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,039
type of the windows event log which
missed a lot of stuff for them or even

50
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,060
worse if they had to do it outside the
fact that have to image of a computer

51
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:49,500
which can take ten fifteen hours per
machine analyze the relationships you

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,210
gotta make sure you know she never been
seen what happens is key to detect

53
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,479
abnormal behavior 82 using stuff living
off the land use cases but if you don't

54
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,380
do relationships you might miss the
malicious use case of crating

55
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,750
replication classic case information so
a lot of good info Intel of their

56
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,470
luggage ready though their diocese out
there so I don't just bring this in

57
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:24,070
automatically protected and finally to
me as much as possible so you want to do

58
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,860
this stuff me all the time you want to
make sure that your response players

59
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,820
have been automated that way you know
just wasting a lot of time around as a

60
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,590
promise that I'm gonna do for the
PowerPoint and we're hoping to do we

61
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:50,390
actually demonstration a question so far

62
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,620
a run apiece attack here nothing crazy
just something they made me a better but

63
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,850
that happens almost every day I see a
lot of in this case issues standards

64
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,820
attack email in this case of companies
or that there's a PDF attached to this

65
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,180
email me to flooding to view it is go
ahead and install a great match download

66
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:26,930
this file now as an attacker I mean
unless I had a security fence to lure

67
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,030
additionally be that would stop its
attack would have no ideas ninety guy

68
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,750
that I just got to be doing a lot of
things in the background it is going to

69
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,870
be able to walk through that but you're
relying on definitions are you relying

70
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,690
on network while to find a better
network connection out or something

71
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,110
called back you might never know this
happened for days weeks months the

72
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,140
average is about 60 days for preschool
director found it so that just doesn't

73
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:06,360
work out now it is just a couple minutes
me to get in and get out

74
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:20,580
guys who want to get into the private
space you obviously make a little more

75
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,409
money working for a couple three letter
agencies when they realize what they

76
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:29,629
want to do is first figure out how they
would stop that the big room and try to

77
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,469
figure out the best way to always stop
their attacks every time but as you

78
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:37,050
don't know just like that every single
pen test out there and let's reduce the

79
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,879
scope or the time allowed for a dentist
they're always going to get in there

80
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,099
always gonna get into matter what so
they realize was that he wanted turnout

81
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,120
turnaround that mindset ok so stopping
us every time how do you make sure you

82
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,069
catch us every time it comes to a
detection capability and what they never

83
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,050
down to what they want to head of time
record every single process instance and

84
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,550
everything we need a new pics assigned
to any single battery that runs you want

85
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,180
to record all the info that you would
typically need to remain your friend its

86
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,150
investigation to grab so with a narrow
this down is to whatever process runs

87
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,770
they want to record every region
modification modification every much

88
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,690
load every network connection

89
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,690
re-cross process access detailed process
find a time any medications fired off

90
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:33,198
the record that as well and he's
mainline entered it was obvious the

91
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:38,789
types can cause I'm not sure what they
want to record this absolutely every

92
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,540
time didn't want to wait for a must be
set for this weekend you'll notice that

93
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,300
had a time when make sure that you
record this everywhere across the board

94
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:58,390
with this allows you to do is basically
when it's time to you know you have some

95
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,870
type of symptom of a compromise their
used to plug in here species like

96
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,060
googling your environment you go up the
smallest threat of an incident you go

97
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,660
off of you know your standard process
name or maybe Hosni you do it by an IP

98
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,959
address destination for that you found
in your network

99
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,360
pieces of ransomware plug in the past
the modified file is encrypted and let's

100
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,410
figure out exactly what led up to that
point of that followed you plug in

101
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,829
strategic trading fell different IOC's
here and go over these in a moment like

102
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,350
virustotal scores abuse at CH four known
as used in other types of banking Trojan

103
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,730
now camping you married only list we
receive just turned on or one with the

104
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,260
facebook credits to quit being so you
just be the smallest start to pull need

105
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:54,499
to create the entire picture of what
happened that attack the question so far

106
00:09:54,499 --> 00:10:06,309
jobs typing in whenever no net user is
centered on any machine you can email

107
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:10,718
your sis laboratory in need of learning
capability to have all that information

108
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:20,539
just sent you proactively as soon as it
happens here have a couple of the next

109
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:24,249
year up from the London Times out there
but for example if you want to keep

110
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,979
track of every time a process makes a
connection to China Russia can do that

111
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:28,449
for you

112
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,779
a time to pass on to child process that
crosses with unusual extension runs

113
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,809
while you're getting hit with these
different tax you want to learn from it

114
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,339
you want to make sure that your texting
is more fine-tuned for you we have to

115
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:49,889
talk about this stuff here so in the
case that PDF attacks amid a very simple

116
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,079
one says okay let me know whenever
something that the non-standard file

117
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,098
extension get PDF JPEG

118
00:10:56,099 --> 00:11:01,449
get assigned to a nationally as a
running process around the top here four

119
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,868
minutes ago I noticed that I got a hit
for an event guide pdf which is the

120
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:20,909
email that I sent it down where was the
past and what computer no read my

121
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,599
profile markets for your model those
network connection to child process

122
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:30,359
spawned doesn't take into a second
expert I realized that most likely to do

123
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:37,239
that so what can I do from here click on
this button and it will bring me to the

124
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:42,309
process analysis speech going back to
prior testicle extra protection I don't

125
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,098
have to reach out to the computer and
get all this information behind no

126
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:50,199
absolute fact the sardine the cost of
solutes computers completely host

127
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:55,229
download bricked this is really just
resting on the backend server

128
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:03,540
when I'm on this page you'll see
filename computer to use the remaining

129
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,610
in the context of how long it ran for
and won it last ran online see that

130
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,120
catch here and everything blues
clickable and searchable even certain to

131
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,560
come and get this was one on the right
hand side of the cliff notes view my

132
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,099
opinion of what that process was it ran
a different attitude you can grab it

133
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,580
with signs etc

134
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:35,490
below that is all that may be great if
you feel that I mention W dot com is

135
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,320
more of a general review from a research
perspective but download it is

136
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,090
interesting to me I could see what child
process want to know what temperature

137
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:55,139
does it open to generate 0

138
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:20,339
this case I migrated to know that I was
going to be adding context was able to

139
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:30,019
steal that after a new bed it's more fun
something to director is about file that

140
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:37,609
I ran that by when it ran its plants in
our power shown attack here and Cody

141
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:43,470
commands good out some more coming back
by other modify the registry year you

142
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,049
get down to what registered user names
once again this is searchable second

143
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:48,879
open this up

144
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,559
searches and see a time in my
environment this is centered on any

145
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,839
other computer now to wait for people to
go out on my blog since it's already

146
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,630
insist any questions on this

147
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:10,220
was a legitimate alert said take action
on it when it comes to taking action

148
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,480
know that they are commonly found was
that people who said it's a response

149
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,090
card not because they did not do it but
rather when it comes to feeding your

150
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,700
computer offline right away if they
wanted to computer to analyze it would

151
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,660
have to open up a ticket with some
desktop off Steve especially if you have

152
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,319
a global company be literally just them
ups in a box over an eight-year takes

153
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,300
too long to slow if you had the rocky
pewter much time to put your company

154
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,020
money so we did was put in a couple of
new features that you could do right

155
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,770
from the screen of your desk it all
those which means of the only network

156
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,329
connection allowed to your car black
server and that's it you don't touch a

157
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,750
firewall rules are in place that the
sensor just actually becomes a network

158
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:06,889
so that I can go live

159
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:35,049
this is also ought to be so I wanted to
automatically certain processes on these

160
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:41,129
box when a certain that you do for
example if you do the same couple of

161
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,879
days to machine we want to triage every
time

162
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,689
well you just said it so in a certain
Travis black have a lot stuff done

163
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:57,030
before you get to a box any questions
here

164
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:13,699
yet so that they could have right now we
have a terrible idea

165
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:25,959
right now they will have connection vs

166
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,209
the question what

167
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,670
absolutely so now as part of your best
practice right whatever your guidelines

168
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,628
are you want to reach out to them and
let them know maybe after reboot a

169
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,850
computer you can also get a lift back in
the console when they come back online

170
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,490
as well

171
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:57,089
question

172
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:02,939
so this is not really what's will house
was but it's a nice thought about having

173
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:08,678
a relationship that had a great attitude
of you know what led up to this point so

174
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,789
it wouldn't be the same way again
compared to football even the best NFL

175
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,779
team in the world and get beat by a good
defense we watch tapes them could be the

176
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:21,669
same way imply that all with distance I
have a great day at a time

177
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:26,909
pretty simple right I can just rewind
the tape so its causes PDF to run

178
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:34,950
working from a command command was
spawned by Acrobat Reader and if I go to

179
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,240
the right here kodaline seeds for a
moment

180
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,340
notice a hundred and sixty four hits
fifty six different reports I get to

181
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,199
total admitted to be false positives to
have a score of 168 the engines in there

182
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,730
but I scroll down 54 relevancy bees that
could have been used in this attack

183
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,320
gorgeous used when there's a W
executable ran I can see all the stuff

184
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,879
and I can also detect on it so they want
to create a watch this alert when every

185
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,169
new CEO relevant program runs I could do
that I did every one of them and see

186
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:19,289
what actually happened after the API so
if you have anything that really source

187
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,190
of IOC's and we can do six taxi coming
but anything gives you a preview for any

188
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,340
size of you nice we can work with you
also agree with a lot of existing

189
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,139
firewall Tools Firewall is like how the
networks prior I checkpoint site for

190
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:44,020
some of the ones we ship with bow I was
abt nine has its own where we have a

191
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,700
threat intelligence cloud over it

192
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,399
team that basically puts down relative
watch lists or relevant information that

193
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,570
we that we found in our travels and also
you wanted to share with us the

194
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,629
information just meditated on itemized
well so using that to analyze it to

195
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,350
shoot down more high competence

196
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,918
involved in the face but it seems the
most recent ones who died on 21 can play

197
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:18,309
is going down as 291 the NBL you get a
direct connect customers who use that do

198
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:23,549
indeed like you to act or activity we
can do that

199
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:34,720
checkpoint Fidelis and any questions
here

200
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,970
going backwards know if I pass this way
to go back to the drawing board I won't

201
00:19:38,970 --> 00:20:04,310
be hit the same way again but I can see
question

202
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:10,000
so the question was what is the overhead
of the products and clearly a common

203
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,870
question to say the least

204
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:18,280
on the host itself no CPU around eight
megs of RAM compared to when it comes to

205
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,220
actually on Roosevelt what is running it
should never get past 1 percent and it

206
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,690
should ever get passed around 10 megs of
RAM that's twenty-four seven you don't

207
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:55,120
do pull

208
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:10,040
comes from about ten megabytes of data
generated parental over 24 hours you

209
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,720
could probably get you want to do so the
bandwidth concern as you said it's not

210
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,670
big but the back of that service does
not require good amount of processing

211
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:27,270
and RAM fastest we have people do ho Suh
WS more expensive server itself can

212
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,139
handle 5,000 machines at once our
biggest climbing right now is a hundred

213
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,110
twenty thousand machines and so they
just cluster of servers yeah we can talk

214
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,719
online as well look at you know what it
looks like your environment

215
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,550
questions

216
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:55,190
couple minutes left here to figure out
the people side of this you know how did

217
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,140
this newbie reader exploits mine when I
could see that a key from Internet

218
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:08,110
Explorer and scroll down in 2004 network
connections are you so that you can

219
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,860
actually made a test of the loop back
and I also communicated out to Cali

220
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,100
several you once again francis's
searchable

221
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,129
opens up a new tab see everyone else
who's ever communicated that IP address

222
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:28,480
36 pics and I can see that PDF also made
a call back to the same site that I

223
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:46,800
going to buy a year which came from
Bundaberg which came from explorer.exe

224
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,520
so now just within a couple of mouse
clicks I was able to figure out not only

225
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,610
what happened when I get your friend got
a large that PDF but also the next step

226
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,330
up a suitable reader the beauty of a
live demo is that made him liking but

227
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,210
also that someone click on this link
originally from an email address from an

228
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:12,150
email clients directly that's really the
standard dog-and-pony recovery tech

229
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,300
obviously there's plenty of ways to use
this tool but it wasn't just some

230
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,030
questions about how come back and use
that question at a time to speed up here

231
00:23:22,030 --> 00:24:38,070
in response process any other questions
today

232
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:53,330
yes

233
00:24:53,330 --> 00:25:08,810
search for this thing up would be
starting to be like I'm asking so for

234
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,570
example it would give you an alert based
off of something the PDF icon of a Dutch

235
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,290
the executable

236
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:31,950
probably what they're talking about you
X

237
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,179
you can search for the process name
writing a file out but unless that file

238
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:43,500
I see rain so in this case that PDF was
in the binary that ran now PDF we just

239
00:25:43,500 --> 00:26:11,789
downloaded in an expert in the commander
of the boundary that region

240
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:24,739
writers show me that in this case
different one this is part of writing

241
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:41,570
but yes the questions out there

242
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,810
point at something that I should go to
mention so while you're going through

243
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,919
the investigations says you to record
everything good and bad some of the

244
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,450
stuff is just general run of the mill of
activity say for example you wanted to

245
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,360
record or because they remembered to
write down at his across processes

246
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,699
during this time but despite notation

247
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,730
rebuilt one here I go into my
investigations panel you can have all

248
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,230
those little different threads pulled in
organized to the stereo the timeline and

249
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,260
also the rocky btw whats the best
practices on what's recorded that time

250
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,910
it's hard to say because every tax gonna
be different we do have pretty good user

251
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,000
training right now they're also we have
a user exchange for more people to share

252
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,250
best practices and also people there is
going to be a dance class classical

253
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:46,290
music for it so I don't have a strict
answer for you for you know what its

254
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,460
good work what is bad to take we can
give you some guidance will tell you if

255
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,010
it's a known good activity but when it
comes to knowing bad that goes back to

256
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,530
the idea that it's hard to know what's
bad time it's hard to say we should take

257
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:06,029
this shouldn't take that

258
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:15,799
happy to speak with a man outside me and
my colleague roadside rest of the day
