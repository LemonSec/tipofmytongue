take my presentation modified needs if

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,279
you like it just gimme credit also your
final my sides pretty boring I'm not one

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:37,160
of these fancy transition text let's
start with random numbers this is pretty

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,398
much going to be the overview of my
presentation I'm going to discuss what

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,780
random numbers are and then we'll just
jump right into the three

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,170
classifications of random numbers that
pseudorandom numbers to graphically

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,480
secure surrounding numbers and then run
the numbers and then we'll talk about

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,050
some randomness tests and wrap up was so
why do we need random numbers it turns

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,149
out we actually use random numbers quite
a bit in our daily life example lottery

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:25,159
drawings although illegal in City Utah
running out of power

13
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:49,369
possible in fact generically gambling
Las Vegas are you playing against the

14
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:56,770
odds that read we also apply very much
in the physical world such as weather

15
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:08,000
modeling thermodynamics quantum
mechanics randomness fits a pattern

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,190
recognition game theory before the
presentation I was showing somebody here

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,470
physical contraption called the Dyson
not seen the day somatic to YouTube so

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,459
this guy runs a runs games by email.com
and he was using a random number

19
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:38,599
generator for his dice crews and people
were getting upset and so he ended up

20
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:47,168
creating this hardware and software
application and he says if you're not

21
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,639
happy with the results he felt that
dates down email it to you and let that

22
00:02:51,639 --> 00:03:01,760
be a lesson so game theory cards online
games like World of Warcraft rely

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,950
heavily on Monte Carlo simulations our
way to approximately eight numerical

24
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,858
values using random numbers and then
finally of course record numbers of the

25
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:23,190
workhorse cryptography we need random
numbers to create unpredictable

26
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:40,160
random this is a pattern or predict
ability of events without a without

27
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,579
border

28
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:52,740
otherwise individual unpredictable which
for example of random numbers million we

29
00:03:52,740 --> 00:04:00,420
should not be able to predict the next
is drawn however we generate large

30
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:14,380
amounts numbers we can start to make
some predictions of some sort of 100,000

31
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,969
random numbers 12 million I can say with
confidence that about one out of every

32
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,240
10 numbers certainly affect loaded on
the number line I could see that ratio

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:35,940
so I can begin to make some say it's
important to separate randomness yes

34
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:43,430
there is the study of dynamical system
where conditions will determine the

35
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,280
outcome but that doesn't necessarily
mean we can predict we can make some

36
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:58,280
predictions short term for example
population growth reaching makes an

37
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:15,239
immediate predictions about the
population and that's as we increase the

38
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:25,740
next that's really the separation
between here is an animated gif showing

39
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,689
a Monte Carlo simulation

40
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,889
numerical value of pi

41
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:38,079
we have the unit circle inscribed inside
of a units and then we are generating

42
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:46,629
random xy coordinates and plugging it in
the square which makes the ratio of the

43
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:54,529
coordinates inside of the coordinates as
we calculate more and more coordinates

44
00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:09,110
that racial approaches

45
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,479
pseudorandom numbers so random number
generators have four properties that

46
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,300
we'd like to have a must first off sorry
to see a pseudo-random number generator

47
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:28,110
is mathematical need something to kick
started many of you are probably

48
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,849
thinking but I know not to start my
serial number generator with time

49
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:44,628
essentially really bad

50
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:55,229
a random number generators are just to
provide randoms second and then we might

51
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,240
have

52
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,830
an actual discussion had random number
generators also we want them to be

53
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:12,400
uniformly distributed this means that
number is likely to be out good as there

54
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:21,310
is no favoritism bias towards one number
either all of the output we want our

55
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,830
pseudo random number generators a random
number generator is treating a secrets

56
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,859
of random numbers earlier friend of mine
just like 10 minutes ago so what's

57
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,599
random about the number 88 well there's
nothing inherently random about any

58
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,280
individual number when you're talking
about random numbers were talking about

59
00:07:45,280 --> 00:08:00,289
a sequence or actual assumptions about
random is individual number itself sure

60
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:08,440
what about 7777 so that we can start
making assumptions about the generator

61
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,580
so large period is creating a sequence
of repetition three members as soon as

62
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,849
that sequences generated we found this
site we want that period to be as large

63
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,960
and of course there should be no reason
why should have to wait around for my

64
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,810
random number when I request so how do
we create a pseudo-random number

65
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:39,750
generator here are three methods that
you could do you want to impress your

66
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:47,100
family and friends Thanksgiving next
three generators the middle square

67
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,750
method for linear tonga winchell
generator and legs

68
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:58,130
cater to these methods begins with the
end agency did we swear that to get a

69
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,270
two digit zero padding as necessary and
then we take the middle and digits and

70
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,590
use that as the next see the process so
for example here's me taking a four

71
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,480
digit number

72
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:22,090
473 I swear it to get to 245 1218 take
the middle four digits as my next year

73
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:28,440
it generated sequence comes out as for
it

74
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:43,570
1985 5 12 10 so this is the middle
school has a very small period in fact

75
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:52,060
when this generator fails fails and it
does so by usually 20 this is the common

76
00:09:52,060 --> 00:10:14,000
case of the generator is a number of
other than the middle numbers 2554 10

77
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:28,160
and some others these two failures make
up the bulk of the failures 0 comments

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:38,600
World generate maybe 10 or 11 random
numbers and then I will cycle back like

79
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:47,720
the previous 30 get stuck on three
numbers in my site so it turns out this

80
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,410
isn't a very good pseudo-random number
generator you want to do something

81
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:59,060
better let's look at the generator it
sounds fancy this is really nothing more

82
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,768
than what you

83
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:08,739
this is just why except reporting module
song it sounded because the numbers are

84
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:16,610
going to continue to grow at an upper
bound on it keep it going to take a seat

85
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:27,679
lot so the generators to find as
exhibition plus one equals times

86
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:39,749
accidental and then we were equals x
plus news as an example for C 27 are

87
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:49,629
scalar 217 and will do this in my 10 so
our first round one time 74 seed plus

88
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:59,309
seven or scalar that becomes our new
seat exit 201 times for + 71111 my

89
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:06,759
tennis 10 new seed right as simple as
why

90
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:17,189
generate a sequence comes 4845 two
nights its obligations

91
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:24,779
period is that most the size of the
modulus are . life is going to be the

92
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:35,389
best numbers and for some choices we do
like the congress generator because it's

93
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:41,839
faster requires state but its third
point is basically saying it's highly

94
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:49,429
predictable it will lie in most in fact
royal times and paper planes and

95
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,610
interventions might expect you to
understand that the takeaway is as

96
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:01,960
predictable wanted to maximize I paid
leave wanted it to be the size of

97
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,540
then we have some requirements and and
the offset the constant be must be

98
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,010
relatively prime that means they share
growth factors 8-1 missed by all the

99
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:22,230
prime factors of em an 8-1 requirements
are met

100
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:30,380
year period now my personal favorite the
legs he cannot see generator the legacy

101
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:39,790
of the nazi generator comes from the
Nazi sequins to ensure all equals 1+2

102
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:49,189
basically we're taking a 2003 add those
two elements in the results and popped

103
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,330
the first and then we read the new to
almonds in this case we're going to

104
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:04,330
genera size instead of hard coating that
a rate which would make a larger array

105
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:12,670
and which are going to be doing missions
we call these the taps so jiang will be

106
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,740
are two types and also we're going to do
a modulus put an upper bound on it to

107
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:26,050
keep it inside space if you want to
generate audit even numbers that you

108
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,459
will need at least one and even number
that comes through the taps entirely

109
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:40,440
even numbers that you're going to
generate entirely so you'll want I don't

110
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:49,520
even have one alright so here is our
form an equal amount of such a process

111
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:59,270
model or serial so you don't have to
have two types also

112
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:10,540
three types of properties to go into it
has been looked into and mathematicians

113
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:19,800
like toward doing the service so let's
start with a seven digit range seed will

114
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:28,109
use a famous number 8675309 which by the
way as a site that's if you ever use

115
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,020
fresh values card's value membership
cards and they allow you to input a

116
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:43,550
number to identify your accounts 8675309
really well so just as an FYI

117
00:15:43,550 --> 00:16:01,219
let's go ahead and choose to tax papers
377 so our third element 79 @ DeMott 610

118
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:13,660
620 haha the first one our third game 6
process it showed us a little bit more

119
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:22,280
clearly put the third and seventh in
brackets so we can see the generator

120
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:30,180
what's getting added as someone is the
phone number is 678 913 710 elements

121
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,849
10066 ended eight gets

122
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:52,010
6753 1961 gets extended sixties pop off
speaking to you right after a suburban S

123
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:59,390
780 number

124
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:29,080
so to the seven is 24 8 16 32 64 is 27
to 29 right so are the size of our

125
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:39,129
period of maximum weigh 127 times 512 in
this weather in order to maximize that

126
00:17:39,130 --> 00:18:04,230
we have to make sure that this second
straight out of the alleged generators

127
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:12,240
is highly complex as well studied for
those of you with Donald Knuth the art

128
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:27,410
of computer programming he has done
research to tap generators failed what's

129
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,280
called the birthdays just the transfer
random but research has been done to us

130
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:47,670
that show that three and four tap and
other tests generators also you're not

131
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:59,280
stuck with the addition you can you see
traction period

132
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:09,520
generation are the most popular
pseudo-random number generator is the

133
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:25,930
default number generator in Python so we
like losing sister because it's fast

134
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,190
others liked when your feedback shift
register to play with Kerry and a number

135
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:37,150
of others write a cryptographically
secure generators cryptographically

136
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:47,210
secure generators have the same for
properties distributed we want a large

137
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,840
but we're going to add two more
requirements to make them cryptographic

138
00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:00,250
the church says they must satisfy the
next what this means is the generator

139
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,560
could generate extra flights can
generate a whole massive data and

140
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:16,020
regardless of how much data you better
accuracy and 50% and no amount of data

141
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,400
beforehand will give you any inclination
it's going to be resumed sister for

142
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:31,160
example require must withstand
compromise extensions that means to

143
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:39,080
state the generator is either partially
or wholly compromise we should not be

144
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,260
able to determine the creepiest
generated numbers generator so we know

145
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:57,020
the current state about the generators
constant ceded that it won't tell us

146
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,970
anything about this because

147
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:09,690
these are the two requirements for a
cryptographically secure and rebuild yes

148
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:16,230
first off you generator absolutely must
be here if you are designing your own

149
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:23,110
algorithm for a generator and you're
using a mathematical function already it

150
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,870
will not be secured just by the nature
and you will be able to predict the next

151
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:43,149
year but help us existing cryptographic
primitives ciphers or if you want to

152
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,169
design something from scratch the return
address the discrete logarithm problem

153
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:56,760
or the quadratic these are problems that
are easy to compute the discrete

154
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:05,490
logarithm problem says I'm gonna take
roots and raise it to expand our prime

155
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:12,820
modulus if that prime modulus and those
numbers are primitive roots then I will

156
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:19,939
get an even distribution to all members
of the month for a repeat accounted for

157
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:37,700
its future series of that Prime
quadratic residue problems just a fancy

158
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,220
way for saying it's hard to factor
numbers if i take 2 prime numbers

159
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,559
multiply them together I get a composite
ACT composite is small but it's not very

160
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,710
difficult for my computer to discover
those factors that affect members

161
00:22:51,710 --> 00:23:02,380
charged that it becomes impractical to
discover so if you can guarantee these

162
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,000
two

163
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:15,850
computing results the discrete logarithm
problem generator for example here's one

164
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,439
called

165
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:26,180
shop this is named after the last days
of the generator this is why this

166
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,960
addresses the quadratic residue hace
problem in other words you're trying to

167
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:39,130
the factors cue from a modulus always
requires a seat and then modulus which

168
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:47,320
is the product of two primes cue
unfortunately setting up show the primes

169
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:57,960
must be congruent 23 much that means
that she is the greatest common divisor

170
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:26,190
whalers cycle actors had the generator
is plus one equals excellence and then

171
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:37,590
we let accident very simple generator
example nineteen NRC this fall the

172
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,300
previous requirements that I just set
the other side so have a large generator

173
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:49,389
and then we just go ahead and square 2
seed 209 which is the product of a

174
00:24:49,390 --> 00:25:00,150
weapon 1909 i squared lot 281 and so on

175
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:10,820
following sequence like this generator
because it guarantees

176
00:25:10,820 --> 00:26:09,059
find it does have that security provided
that are modulus outside

177
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:39,139
encrypted with an encrypted and continue
in that manner or 256 etcetera

178
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:47,758
so this means that we're going to
require this is the secret security in

179
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,389
the generators this is where you would
not want to use your time as the G

180
00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:00,428
mister time can be discovered we can
compromise the generator so you want

181
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:09,100
this to have sufficient entropy again
and then we'll have a secure generator

182
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,580
so here's an example 128

183
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,309
those of you who are familiar with
cryptographic primitives and bauxite

184
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:35,190
you're probably seeing a bunch of red
flags right now and I'm only gonna be

185
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,970
encrypting one block Teresa this fits
fine because i dont have a second or so

186
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:53,409
I don't have any structure and it's a
completely new to walk so you see people

187
00:27:53,409 --> 00:28:04,289
who don't have an initialization don't
have a counter

188
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:11,340
828 bits of zeros its Mikey right and
Casey etcetera and then we go ahead and

189
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:19,049
just a quick bit 0 with the result

190
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:50,030
cancer encrypted there's counter script
and so forth

191
00:28:50,030 --> 00:29:06,240
security secure well and also the
private key but it also must have

192
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:14,550
sufficient trippy he needs to be
unpredictable the unpredictable nature

193
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:24,639
discovered further because these graphic
primitives using operating binary mode

194
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,210
probably output primary blobs to your
screen to do some coding and that may

195
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:39,300
head to the overall market another
generator standardized generator by and

196
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:48,850
see its find in NZ X 917 and its initial
defined by using 64 bit troubled us a

197
00:29:48,850 --> 00:30:02,870
sense been superseded by NZXT 43232
where to find 128 bit AES generator

198
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:10,229
works in this way and its seed of course
have my private key and then all the

199
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:15,590
numbers and I want to generate each time
in this I'm going to get it current

200
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:25,550
precision picosecond I'm going to
encrypt that time stamp to create a

201
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:37,790
temporary value next step is to
exclusive or the sea as for a reseed

202
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,379
regenerate and you see and I do that

203
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:51,380
exploring just recently random number
with temporary earlier and that becomes

204
00:30:51,380 --> 00:31:03,450
mucci generated timestamp get him to
tell you about seventeen I ignore the

205
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,360
fact that I am importing some modules
and setting up safe environment

206
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,750
variables and functions rents the
structure of the generator for I in the

207
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:21,310
range of the numbers I create that
temporary bankrupting the date when I go

208
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:32,530
ahead and get an output by encrypting
the and the temple and then print out

209
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:39,430
there but I wrote a Python script to do
this

210
00:31:39,430 --> 00:32:33,900
switches to generate a key I see this is
a standard generator and interesting

211
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:41,030
side effect you are using this as an
adversary could set your clock and

212
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:50,000
manipulate the outlet generator there's
been some including myself out tried a

213
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,570
switch cryptographically secure random
number generator in the Linux kernel

214
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:09,409
with the exit 79 so

215
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:24,020
question

216
00:33:24,020 --> 00:34:24,710
an NTP service running on the host a
sufficient time

217
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:43,940
other concerns keep giving some other
cryptographically secure random number

218
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,909
generators blum blum should be addressed
the quadratic residue opposite problem

219
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,720
let me charlie is another one that you
could do by hand

220
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,160
addresses the discrete logarithm problem
last some others like Isaac the inverse

221
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:09,000
congressman generator rule 34 turns out
the guys not only did businessmen short

222
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,430
mathematician scientist she developed
thirty as a random number generator

223
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:30,589
where looks chaotic nature there's an
article on it and there is controversy I

224
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:36,089
wrote as a learning exercise for myself

225
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:42,820
program I decided to write graphically
secured to the random number generators

226
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,369
so far

227
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:59,240
node to see guys but projects generated

228
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:10,029
alright enough with pseudo-random number
generator into true random numbers true

229
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,640
random numbers have a completely
different set of requirements and their

230
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,339
surrender counterparts for stuff to
random number generators must I do not

231
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:25,910
know

232
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:31,710
so this means that you're going to need
to do

233
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:47,319
generator in my generation as well as
you can't verify that the generator is

234
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:54,349
doing what is aimed toward I know that's
a simple question and I'm not accusing

235
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:59,470
the agency of your USB port or random
number generator but if you can't verify

236
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,299
the hardware and software you're putting
a lot of trust in someone who's making

237
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:10,839
such claims that might be sleeping
certainly be using this for long term

238
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:22,349
cryptographic keys getting stuff you can
verify also the physical phenomena using

239
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:28,390
for the generation process should
probably also be verified it's really

240
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:54,250
easy to say yeah this is really two
classifications thoughts are random

241
00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:06,880
number generation discuss the quantum
state things like nuclear decay to get a

242
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,799
Geiger counter on the nuclear source or
sources after a week's time when

243
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:22,500
particles traveling through a
semi-transparent

244
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:53,970
shot noise circuits and the case of
reverse transistors and as a result

245
00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:10,689
strikes so on and so forth

246
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:22,550
resource not even culture is hard drive
by human interaction humans are very

247
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,770
random when they think about it but they
are random in their physical

248
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:34,090
interactions world for example the
timings between your typing actually

249
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:50,390
turn out to where you moving the mouse
also have some people as I mentioned

250
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:58,069
earlier true random number generators
are almost always they are just so they

251
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:05,750
need to be widened by seeing you talk
about a couple second a statistical

252
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:19,410
tests on the quality of the random
numbers should always be run as hardware

253
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:25,999
is degrading the quality of your random
number generators

254
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:38,658
and of course she was fortunate with
generators is they break meaning that

255
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:49,009
it's not easily detectable that
generators may be influenced by outside

256
00:40:49,009 --> 00:41:05,079
interference I have a list of guys this
one right here

257
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:17,459
open hardware Open Firmware Campbell New
Zealand just called the one reading this

258
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:33,129
uses shot noise one source also has a
2.4 gigahertz wireless antenna range as

259
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:38,439
a source of rounders I know that this is
being used in infrastructure and I'm

260
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:50,029
close to the January waves I could
manipulate so while can be a good source

261
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:57,250
so keep that in mind

262
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:03,070
simply by see Methods one common way is
the john Dunn normandy by assume this is

263
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,790
at two consecutive bits in the generator

264
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:29,210
identical we discard them if they are
not identical 101010 we're going out

265
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:40,560
after the guarantee you will not
guarantee you random white let's say we

266
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:49,740
go ahead and discard all of our funds
and we're left with 111 111 111 while

267
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,209
technically we did biased generator we
produced very predictable very

268
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:04,220
predictable stream data so that is
another way to do the biasing whitening

269
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,330
of the random number generator to send
it

270
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:19,000
graphic primitives IKS shot you could do
six data hardware the output from the

271
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,850
true random number generator becomes the
seed for the cryptographic primitive so

272
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,900
the output of the cryptographic
primitive is still truly randomized

273
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,480
however provided that we have the
necessary security much margins from the

274
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:53,320
cryptographic primitive we can see that
generator for the data was shot 256

275
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,020
output 256

276
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:17,310
is going to be some devices are here is
some USP true random number generators

277
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,910
if you're interested if you do it
Wikipedia search for comparison of

278
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:33,620
hardware random number generators I
actively contribute to value her dollar

279
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:42,279
per price you see the intel Ivy Bridge
processors later that are here and on

280
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:53,100
that I would get the most expensive bits
per dollar spent generator the hardware

281

usually close which is an additional
ones they're kinda can I have talked to

285
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:45,840

00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,350
see if they meet some criteria that we
know about this is used to judge the

288
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,819
quality of the generator there's a shift
so there's what's called the diehard

289
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:30,830
tests has a battery of tests that he can
run like the birthdays and then there's

290
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:49,779
also a userspace entropy s here's a
diehard tests these days facing parking

291
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,350
lot test so forth

292
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:59,770
hard there's a die harder userspace
utility that you can use I'll go ahead

293
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:06,730
and use one of my hardware generators
one of these guys will generate a file

294
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:14,340
of say a megabyte megabyte whatever size
harder on this case I called it and

295
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:29,350
speed up in and we'll see if he's just
wanted to do with the shape of

296
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:37,819
considerable time I file looking at
dozens of minutes so that it runs set

297
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:47,120
aside and see what the FIPS 140 test two
tests a different set of tests

298
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,240
generator

299
00:47:49,240 --> 00:48:02,368
and use an example of tips 140 destitute
there's a user's users and we can see

300
00:48:02,369 --> 00:49:28,950
what we can see that it was roughly 130
megabytes 172 tests 272 successes and

301
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:45,439
there are two the only difference

302
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:52,599
is def random will block within the
system thinks that the entropy of the

303
00:49:52,599 --> 00:50:50,640
system as weird as you read it will not
take away from this is really random

304
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,690
numbers which have seen a random number
generators cryptographically secure and

305
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,819
then Sri random number generators each
with their own advantages and

306
00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:04,410
disadvantages we should always be
running randoms generator and whenever

307
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:10,890
in doubt used a few random that's all I
have are there any comments questions or

308
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:23,549
remarks

309
00:51:23,550 --> 00:52:29,990
generator generator and then go ahead
and HTML files so any other questions
