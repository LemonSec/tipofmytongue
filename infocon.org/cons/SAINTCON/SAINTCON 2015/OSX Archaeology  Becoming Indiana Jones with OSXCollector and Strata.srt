1
00:02:13,280 --> 00:04:06,640
1520 1525 previous year probably
averages out to be about every other

2
00:04:06,640 --> 00:05:21,889
week or every walking

3
00:05:21,889 --> 00:06:08,590
stages were like so few resources we
have dedicated to looking into these

4
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:46,258
figures so the problem for us figure out
what was so how many of you also look

5
00:06:46,259 --> 00:07:26,980
it's a great help you do

6
00:07:26,980 --> 00:09:08,430
file me how long the sisters formation
of the sections but you can run the

7
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:22,359
script sections KK Houser history that
kind of information graphics

8
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:35,980
Alexis so did the deed is elected

9
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:50,970
really sorry for the screen so you can
do standard tools just a simple

10
00:09:50,970 --> 00:10:00,420
scattered the file specific time range
of time how everything that was

11
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:53,189
collected by Victor everything depends
again as the date rapes jQuery jQuery so

12
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,120
I don't know if you can see it but right
here

13
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:16,670
down during this time frame 1 spot so
you want to advance so advanced fuel

14
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:27,969
filters are you give this morning how
does the phone

15
00:11:27,970 --> 00:15:16,240
exactly what you expected to tell me
they are

16
00:15:16,240 --> 00:16:29,860
script

17
00:16:29,860 --> 00:17:21,319
we did that dated to the hard to find
out to us so that we can download files

18
00:17:21,319 --> 00:18:57,040
you guys there by us for a lot of these
guys

19
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:31,389
everything so neither is really base so
let's just visualize the visual learner

20
00:19:31,390 --> 00:20:31,180
like to see things so the framework grew
up here so I wanted to write something

21
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:44,090
obviously script everything how I wrote
you can now import to strategy when you

22
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:54,199
put them now through every check it
check all those who are you going with

23
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,990
you I already had already flagged

24
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,340
criteria

25
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:59,100
go out and check other guys black laces
and every day to restore my PC users

26
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:16,740
enter whatever she should check your
your has to be first x-force source just

27
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:37,050
the state calls second database white
was blacklist worked on so the shadow

28
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:54,310
just hash whitelist so just tell you
that was good no its ok to have a system

29
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:08,800
it's not on their application is better
to explore the second you can

30
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:28,450
IP's houses I sent thousands of requests
it hasn't locked me out so that the

31
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:43,630
public right now so that takes to
throttle built into it

32
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:52,490
total analyzes just put your license
they're very different license whatever

33
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:00,900
so they don't make a check so you don't
like these are some of the places like

34
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:51,920
this from where our patrol external
calls

35
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:23,149
questions

36
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:40,018
so the Help menu so you can do a lot of
different things from this you can

37
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:46,690
import run now just import file and the
reason you would want to just import

38
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:55,889
files you'd really no specific time or
what

39
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:12,859
sometimes takes time and it took hours
now so forget it don't you just come

40
00:26:12,859 --> 00:27:16,280
back it's better than 12 hours you doing
elsewhere you just heard this before

41
00:27:16,280 --> 00:28:11,450
you got what you hear back their release
it today but work so we're a little

42
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:34,620
behind but its function so a couple of
collections 3093 imports from here some

43
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:48,709
of these elections

44
00:28:48,710 --> 00:29:24,270
capacity flag gonna run analysis so
close the whole file

45
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:39,139
scripts and not knowing something other
questions I think that perhaps because

46
00:29:39,140 --> 00:30:32,850
it's already stated already in our
database so it doesn't go out

47
00:30:32,850 --> 00:31:08,889
filter black ones what's going on in
their three different houses cottages

48
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:24,280
2012 file patent data collector
everything perhaps is that we run so

49
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:47,480
it's gonna be there so I get its core
founder of its not sure is also not sure

50
00:31:47,480 --> 00:32:20,410
why it is ok its owner of 261 so
whatever their 56

51
00:32:20,410 --> 00:33:51,690
if you score here

52
00:33:51,690 --> 00:34:59,090
whatever it was that wasn't bad just too

53
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:15,750
there as well

54
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:47,610
to grab this at some other grass here
yet to have a structure the 60 counts

55
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:57,910
are all the applications have the same
data plans this subsection applications

56
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:52,299
applications so they have to look the
same just imports so

57
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:10,970
here sorry this is here

58
00:37:10,970 --> 00:38:35,980
it didn't find it

59
00:38:35,980 --> 00:39:48,710
here so we're just 23 lots of red we got
down here in this section here

60
00:39:48,710 --> 00:40:05,839
this black section that pulls all the
black guidance from the graph and see a

61
00:40:05,839 --> 00:41:43,578
user downloaded file was created this
down

62
00:41:43,579 --> 00:42:12,440
your company these users have the same
source that the search reach you just

63
00:42:12,440 --> 00:43:31,790
have to search through do something with
the locks

64
00:43:31,790 --> 00:45:04,970
project questions
