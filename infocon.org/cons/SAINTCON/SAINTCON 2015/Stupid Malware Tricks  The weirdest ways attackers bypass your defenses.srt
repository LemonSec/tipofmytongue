1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,879
that I just inspect just to watch them
die and I'm gonna talk to you today

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:09,040
about some of these stupidest things
that I see happening that caused

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:26,220
machines infected do so it is freaking
out let's let's drop the screen

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:36,910
resolution of it and see if that fixes
it sorry everyone

5
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:54,980
1280 by 800 maybe that works

6
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:09,570
720

7
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:19,449
stupid stuff that we're talking about
among other things in the in the lab

8
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,110
that I operate in both here in Draper in
in colorado we're running a lot of now

9
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,530
we're in real machines were running a
non viens the company I work for make

10
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,320
some very interesting malware detonation
products as well as I used those in the

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,169
lab but you know in general what I'm
doing on a day-to-day basis I'm running

12
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,250
this stuff observing what it's doing and
then trying to in the case of when it's

13
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,850
something interesting publicize it in
the case of in most cases I'm trying to

14
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,520
add the domains and IP addresses where
the malware is talking to win it's

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,410
retreating malware from somewhere on the
net to our reputation service which then

16
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,810
protect our customers and when I see
that's dumb or stupid stuff I try to

17
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,470
call attention to it so these are the
products we use security analytics

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,859
basically is like a rorschach on
steroids it busy full system which

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,290
allows you to search using that method
to find interesting traffic that's all

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,590
this ability is a man in the middle SSL
decryption box is a standalone box just

21
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,940
sits there you see a certain to get on
all the machines are going to be

22
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,140
infected with malware malware infect
them and then you watch all the SSL

23
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,260
traffic malware analysis of plants is
basically a sandbox that runs the

24
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:55,179
malware in a Windows environment and
then gives you a nice report right a lot

25
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:07,519
of third-party tools and just stepped on
a land without replace the switch so I

26
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:17,209
really want to show you so yet clear out
here from Colorado on Monday and just in

27
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,010
the in my experience of flying out in
one day I found 43 stupid things

28
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,290
happening in public places

29
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,929
this is the first ones I was in the
airport in Denver waiting to get on the

30
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,410
plane and I noticed that the monitors in
the in the lobby were throwing these

31
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,280
weird error messages they were kind of
displaying stuff and it took a closer

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,100
look at them and here's the tight
screenshot and you know it was playing a

33
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,940
bunch of information about what was
running on the machines that were doing

34
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,880
the displays and it had their entire you
know toolbar at the bottom of the screen

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,220
with all the things in the system tray
all the applications there on that if

36
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,720
altered installed by default in in the
toolbar at the bottom of the screen

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,329
really dumb things you know like seeing
what all the applications are unaware

38
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,739
that bullseye thing is the training in
the system tray but it doesn't look good

39
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,130
in a few feet down in the scene building
there was a different display and this

40
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,320
one had this down new hardware running
into you know you could see that it had

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,969
like somebody something into it and it
was trying to load the drivers for it

42
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,310
and you can also see in the system tray
that it had DNC installed not something

43
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,280
you want to advertise to everyone in
your airport right here in Utah and I

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,260
was going to check out and this is what
was displayed on the card swiping

45
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,159
machine when I went about my card
actually went to a different checkout

46
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,260
line but it had the information of the
IP address information what operating

47
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,039
system is running on the point of sale
thing I like the fact that it was it was

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,199
running these fancy pants so when we
talk about now we're stuff a lot of the

49
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,830
stuff that makes it into the news are
these apt groups or something

50
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,250
signed up and whatever it is that for
every one of those kinds of things that

51
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,490
makes the news there are thousands of
ETF is out there we're just trying to

52
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,860
get by on a day-to-day basis

53
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,630
committing crimes stealing from people
to make a buck doing all this stuff when

54
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,110
they're running there now where it's
very hard it's not an easy thing to do

55
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,960
you can see from this list that they
have to kind of managed this entire

56
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:40,919
process I wouldn't be able to do it it's
not an easy job but somehow these guys

57
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,710
you no clue to their way through it but
they usually do it really badly in one

58
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,510
or another aspect they're not perfect at
everything right so here's some of the

59
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,789
things that make these tricks that
they're using stupid the reader obvious

60
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:02,180
you know just out there for everyone to
see where they make mistakes sometimes

61
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,310
you just have bad now we're and its
budget crashes or just reveals itself or

62
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,100
does something that's so obvious think
how could someone possibly get infected

63
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,820
with this and yet they do and the people
who are confronted with these attacks

64
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,700
it's the same thing you would think that
your users and administrators in your

65
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,800
organizations are smart enough not to
get fooled by this but the reality is

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,460
that we do get fooled by these things on
a daily basis sometimes you have control

67
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,320
over it and sometimes you don't but
either way the smartest people in the

68
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,849
room will still get tricked by these
things once in awhile

69
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,970
one of my colleagues told me the other
day that he got an email that look like

70
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,310
it came from LinkedIn disclosed clicking
it really something you know popped up

71
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,440
in his mind he had a red flag on it and
the hover the mouse over the Lincoln it

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,560
wasn't going to make dinner with fishing
pitch so anybody can get caught

73
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,419
so what are some of these stupid tricks
so one of the one of my focus of

74
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,430
research at work on a lot is malicious
spam

75
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,040
I see a lot of it system in the lab
that's basically collecting this you

76
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,060
want to send me yours and I would
actually love to get it then come talk

77
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:33,000
to me after the the talk a ton of this
stuff and this is the malicious spam is

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,590
the worst of them all at the end of this
there's usually an hour payload on a

79
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,900
Windows machine that receive these
messages for one reason or another one

80
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,729
of the characteristics that we see the
sort of the worst kinds of these fans is

81
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,860
that they do appeal to emotion there
trying to tell you

82
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,680
speeding to get yours the picture from
the camera that proves that your car was

83
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,020
the one that was speeding they tell you
he wanted free coupon for free pizza

84
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,090
they'll tell you things like there's a
murderer on the loose the attached file

85
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,070
contains the information from the New
York City Police Department and if you

86
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:22,880
see this person makes things easier all
the way and it's just that I slice of

87
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,320
them it's no longer just you know you
have a package UPS is trying to deliver

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,620
it to you and they can't get it to you
as your shipping information it's gone

89
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,479
way beyond that these troops are part of
the mouth and family and they

90
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,589
continually grow so we could say watch
out for stuff like a shipping email her

91
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,410
look for stuff you know says from the
police have speeding ticket but the

92
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,540
reality is it's just to make you click
before you take to get that emotional

93
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,069
thing firing up in your chest

94
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:06,040
know something bad cheapest before you
think about it you've already infected

95
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,519
they're doing that it used to be used to
be pretty much universal that these

96
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,449
males fans would include zip file with a
malicious executable insight and it's

97
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:22,829
still the case a lot of the time but not
all the time and just in the last month

98
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:30,130
we see a huge increase in the mouse in
this using document files Word docs

99
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,850
Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint

100
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,589
contains macros and other scripting that
will allow the guys either drop a file

101
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,350
that's embedded thank you

102
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,600
embedded in your system embedded in the
word document document on your system

103
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,230
will go out and download that stuff and
bring it down your machine and it's

104
00:09:52,230 --> 00:10:05,639
extremely effective because most people
don't think they're stupid tricks that

105
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,660
we see a lot is this

106
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:15,939
use convoluted or confusing or just
really elaborate tricks where they want

107
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,339
to infect your system and they're trying
to hide their tracks and they go through

108
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,190
a huge numbers steps to try to hide
their tracks and at any of those things

109
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:31,310
fail then the whole thing feels and
that's what's going on for about six

110
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,000
months the beginning of this year and
it's kind of trailed off but I don't

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,990
believe that this is gone for good

112
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,069
linked at the bottom of the screen here
doing infographic that we created to

113
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:47,540
kind of document the process involved in
one of these extremely complicated

114
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,719
attacks and huge domino effect of stuff
that eventually leads to infection but

115
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,810
only at all the pieces work

116
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:06,050
what you do how do you find out what's
bad and how do you basically work to

117
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,670
counter this well a lot of that it took
a lot of the time it's actually really

118
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,020
easy to see it's not easy to see on the
screen unfortunately I'm sorry for the

119
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,110
people in the back so example here's
that pizza hut coupon ad that I was

120
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,830
talking to you about some really nasty
its you click the thing that says get

121
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,589
free pizza coupon and it would deliver
you into a zip contain an executable

122
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,740
email and describe it to you it says
it's from be too high

123
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,750
support at seguridad dot com dot AR ok
so probably wouldn't be sending you a

124
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,600
message from a server based in Argentina
at the bottom there the kind of shows

125
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:58,420
that you know where this was going to go
to his shoes for crews dots in so in

126
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,770
Argentinian server send you an email
that says it's from Pizza Hut that links

127
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,689
to a server in China and delivers a zip
file that contains an executable how do

128
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,640
you not miss this stuff and yet it's
incredibly effective this particular

129
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,310
campaign is hot dry Jackson it was being
used regularly for about a year until

130
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:26,219
they realized that turned the patterns
in the URL since they were using and

131
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,710
they were able to figure out that if you
look at the file is it coming down that

132
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:37,170
it's it's probably bad so they stopped
doing it now they're using these were

133
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:47,020
documents that are popular you know
method of getting people to infect

134
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,760
themselves for your kid wants to get you
know get my crap but they don't want to

135
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,510
pay for its $1 on the App Store go to
some site that lets them downloaded for

136
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,310
free version of the app

137
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:07,109
and it's unbelievably bad how effective
this is as a technique because people

138
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,960
will do anything for us $3.00

139
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,370
download a Trojan in effect themselves
just save themselves as fuck you know

140
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,770
any idea what it's going to do and it's
it's just it incredibly effective

141
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,150
technique it's kind of depressing and
we've been seeing a lot of these lately

142
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:35,199
so that screenshot shows a of what we
used to call a rogue antivirus or you

143
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,100
know just some kind of a warning message
that seems to indicate that there's a

144
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,660
problem with the machine you're using
and we see these on Windows where you

145
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,459
get these pop-ups that that take full
screen of the machine and they tell you

146
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,240
to call an 800 number because Windows
port needs to talk to you about

147
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,300
something and then the people on the
phone will skin you out of her box like

148
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:07,650
this one because in particular was
visiting a site is on the tablet tablets

149
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,199
been modified with something called
CyanogenMod so was running the Android

150
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,870
but it's a custom version of Android and
the user agent string in the browser

151
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,990
didn't pass the version of the tablet
that was being used up to the web server

152
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:30,610
so when this thing when he displays this
popup message the one in the upper left

153
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:39,760
the generic Android tablets nothing more
scary than the generic alert the most

154
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,230
effective way of getting rid of these
things close the browser it's not gonna

155
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:52,330
do anything bad especially if it sees no
fake windows things just kill it

156
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:00,190
talk about some of the things they do so
this is one of my favorites is an all

157
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,870
time popular thing with malware guys to
take a file that an executable and stick

158
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,790
a you know

159
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,000
yeah in the middle of the file name and
then have to die exe and why did they do

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,400
that because for most people when you
get windows out of the box it turns off

161
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,970
the feature within Windows that shows
you the the real style suffix so you

162
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,030
disguise something with an icon that
looks like a word doc and you send it to

163
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,900
somebody

164
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,500
most people are not going to recognize
that that's an executable it's actually

165
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,470
really easy to see if you just right
click it and properties before you own

166
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,570
it but how many people do you know that
do that

167
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,110
undeservedly effective when the other
bad things that they're doing a lot of

168
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:02,910
is this working process we're used to be
that when you would run a piece of

169
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,410
malware you could open up task manager
and you might see the malware as a

170
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,370
process running in in in Process
Explorer insisting it's not just in

171
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,990
training in task manager ver that's not
really the case anymore now where is

172
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,850
gonna hook a system process and when
within the memory space of that system

173
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,840
process so that it just looks like you
know services studies real services

174
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,200
there's nothing about it that is
indicative that it's doing anything bad

175
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,580
but in this case this is a machine that
was running Windows XP we expected it

176
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,420
with the Trojan called dire and tired as
SSL for its command control

177
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,599
communications in this case did you just
look at the you look at the properties

178
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,300
of this thing in Process Explorer go to
the tcp/ip tad you can see that you're

179
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,880
you know this decomp launch service is
doing all this

180
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,840
SSL traffic and was trying to connect to
SMTP server as well

181
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,560
the SSL traffic was on this weird port
443 which is an indicator of compromise

182
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,319
for your diary we see that a lot but you
know just takes looking to see that like

183
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,230
this is the process that doing something
bad it is me being infected machine

184
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,260
it's actually kind of hard to discern
this I don't know how many people run

185
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,709
Process Explorer all the time I have it
set to start up when I move my machine

186
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,440
not a lot of people are using it but
incredibly useful tool by the way

187
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:39,570
another undeservedly successful social
engineering trick is to try to trick

188
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,960
someone into disabling a security
feature that would otherwise protect

189
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,240
them we see this with the militias Word
documents in the michigan militias Excel

190
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,610
document his mailbox the user to enable
macros scripted by default Microsoft

191
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:59,699
Office turns these things off and it's
all for a reason and they will messages

192
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,799
on this on the toolbar that scripting is
disabled for this document you

193
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,080
downloaded from the Internet this is
really bad don't do it and then the

194
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:16,629
document is all you need to do this to
be able to see the document

195
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:29,770
infected birds but they want to use that
machine as much as possible and so a lot

196
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,930
of the time we see them basically
repurposing them for other things you

197
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:40,460
might see some percentage of a botnet
used to send more spin to reinstate

198
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,580
other users increased in size and it's
really fun when we see this in the lap

199
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,689
because we're getting all this e-mail
we're recording it all with security

200
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,130
analytics and we can see where it's
going to be coming from

201
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,270
sometimes we see who's controlling it we
get all their usernames and passwords

202
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,020
for these mailboxes are using to send it
and we get the samples if they attach

203
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,460
them to the messages were the URLs in
the messages so in the case of this

204
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,600
slice that in the upper left corner
there was infected with dry acts in it

205
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,780
and try to hold down a second was doing
spam breathing and was just doing SMTP

206
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,090
to hundreds and hundreds of people just
you wait to pull the plug on that

207
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:33,530
machine because it was becoming a
nuisance the one on the bottom

208
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,540
she was infected with with a malicious
document the militias document dropped

209
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,460
downloader and pony downloaded critical
wall which is one of these really nasty

210
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,050
crypto ransom where's that then your
information hostage for boxers that's

211
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:56,879
normally when we see the crypto
ransomware stuff get on the machine it's

212
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,060
usually the end stage of the infection
its win the bad guys have decided that

213
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,460
there's nothing really left of value
that they can get off this machine said

214
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,160
she's gonna hold you hostage and teach
them some money or wait the box this was

215
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,200
a weird because this particular machine
reopen the word doc drops a Trojan

216
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,140
marching down but it's a ransomware
ransomware then downloads another Trojan

217
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,910
kind of weird never seen

218
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,500
that before church in with a proxy
server proxy server is getting

219
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,080
communication back and forth all day
long from Russia so they're sending

220
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,750
commands through my machine connected
webmail services they were using Gmail

221
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,790
Yahoo and this 16 3.com to send spam and
they were attaching the malware

222
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,280
malicious Dr the spam messages in the
webmail so you can see here that you

223
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,560
know the MIME types were represented
here you know they're sending the

224
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,570
message and then hears the word document
that was being attached to it as well so

225
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,810
nice because we're getting busy getting
the malware before the victim we could

226
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,570
send it on to virustotal immediately and
then before the victim victim opens the

227
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,250
message and then you don't get the word
document themselves their ed will catch

228
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:25,870
it so some of the network stuff so by
the way we're about halfway through the

229
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,229
presentation and I wanted to let you
guys know that if there's any questions

230
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,170
for me either

231
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:40,780
questions crisis so please don't be shy
and feel free to share your questions I

232
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:53,760
think I can see most of you so her arms
around yes

233
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,960
machine get infected if you don't have
admin rights sometimes but usually not

234
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,620
so most of them elsewhere in the in the
cases that I'm showing you basically you

235
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:14,949
required to have admin rights to be able
to execute a payload run a program that

236
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,860
was not previously proved sometimes
those sometimes they can go so it kind

237
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,240
of depends on the sum of the long run

238
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,360
introduced permissions mode and then
they might have a system process and

239
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,560
quit and then use that system process
with higher-level provisions to do other

240
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,710
things but in some cases are reduced
permission level can protect you can see

241
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:51,280
me afterwards so this is just a slice of
the distribution ad networks or ad

242
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,610
networks that my network was talking to
over 199 and a half days from the

243
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:03,419
beginning of the year until yesterday
the screenshot delegation tab insecurity

244
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,010
and you can see that there's pretty much
a distribution across everywhere where

245
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,060
you would expect there would be a lot of
internet access where people are running

246
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,000
data centers or some of this stuff is
hosted because a lot of the bad stuff is

247
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,010
happening you know not on some guys
computer in Nigeria but it's happening

248
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:28,650
up in the clouds somewhere in the garden
areas controlling it one of the tricks

249
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,990
that these guys are using is to try to
figure out once they've gotten on your

250
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,880
machine if there if they want to be able
to do specific things with that infected

251
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,010
machine they want to know where in the
world is it well the problem is is that

252
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,050
most species are now running almost no
one is going to have an infected machine

253
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,740
connected directly to the internet
without some kind of barrier between it

254
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:58,090
and and addresses not useful so a lot of
peas malware has gotten into the habit

255
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,220
now using a couple of different methods
of figuring out what their public static

256
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,850
IP addresses and sending them back to
home it's pretty easy so this is the

257
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,639
rule one of the rules that we have in
the malware announced plans that we used

258
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,330
to determine when something is has a
propensity to be doing bad things with

259
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,010
all these patterns and this is the
pattern for figuring out which are

260
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:27,750
public places I get dresses right it's
just looking for DNS resolution requests

261
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,899
for any of these websites and it's it's
amazing to me that the network guys used

262
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:38,059
the same services over and over and over
again because its very easy two counts

263
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:44,678
create one of these things but what they
do is use these free services on the you

264
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,409
know with the idea behind it being know
what we're looking for this because it's

265
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:50,750
it's a public service

266
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,399
yeah sure people use it all the time but
when you're running and now we're in a

267
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,830
sandbox this is a bad indication of
something to come this is one that's

268
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,820
worth mentioning so I mentioned this
tragic on tire yourself or its

269
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,639
management role traffic is pioneered a
lot of very interesting techniques for

270
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,149
excellent training data and finding out
information about the machine it's

271
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,270
running on one of the techniques
pioneered is it was the first malware

272
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,730
that we saw that uses this protocol
cults done that's done is used in a lot

273
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,220
of ways of writing services sometimes
network attached storage uses it and

274
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,510
it's a way of tunneling through an apt
to find what your public IP is so that

275
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,020
you know your bondage and you've got a
large box box inside of a gnat and

276
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,399
someone wants to make a call to you that
box has to be able to receive the call

277
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,350
and do its thing so stunned is really
part and parcel of these VoIP services

278
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,158
dyer was using stun to do exactly the
same thing and they were using the voice

279
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,360
over IP service done servers to do it
and the cool thing about stun is it

280
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,129
doesn't just tell you what the IP
addresses

281
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,670
but it actually profiles the net in a
way that like the key to a lot more

282
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,510
information about the internet work and
it sends out that stuff back in its

283
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,500
community control traffic which is at
the bottom that some of the the c2

284
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,550
traffic to be decrypted form from a cell
you can see there was no reporting that

285
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,879
it was on a symmetric now in this is the
reason I P

286
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,280
another bad day

287
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,520
user agents seized drive me crazy
because they're so look at that one of

288
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:40,500
the bottom electrode exe swallow it
right so their ticket there's a lot of

289
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,170
these and it's like them our guys don't
think anyone's looking because they're

290
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:52,520
not usually but I am and I see it so you
can see in the in the upper box there's

291
00:26:52,520 --> 00:27:02,730
a lot of wins it's a 6.1 6.2 6.3 East
tokens represent for Windows 7 Windows 8

292
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:09,860
when is a point 1-10 but there's more
than the 5.1 is Windows XP and then

293
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,149
there's the one at the bottom but
Windows Intune 9.0 doesn't exist

294
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,490
a real internal version number for
Windows

295
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:27,540
it never existed interesting is there's
one that's for Windows seven so it says

296
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:35,399
Windows 86.1 Internet Explorer 7 well
it's you know anything about Windows

297
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,590
seven you know that when it shipped it
had winters in Internet Explorer 8

298
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,120
installed it by default

299
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,520
never had winners never had I been
installed so it's one of these cases

300
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:53,020
where it looks like an otherwise normal
totally benign user agent but when you

301
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,900
think about it you realize that doesn't
make any sense and if you're if you're

302
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,160
running an organization where you you
know you've got a lot of machines and

303
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,570
you're collecting this data and use
media couple of standard images for your

304
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,909
machines it's very easy to kind of pick
out you know standard box that's using

305
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,080
are you know companies are

306
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,408
nations image we go to a website with
Internet Explorer this with the

307
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:22,590
user-agent gonna look like anything
that's different from this person is

308
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,000
either mess with their machine or
something is very wrong and especially

309
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:37,120
when you see stuff like five point 001
Windows UNT four point out so is the MSI

310
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:50,010
796 alright really dumb one ok words
word salad it's what my thoughts used to

311
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:57,149
call it that sell it is we didn't mix up
just juggling together and pull it and

312
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,760
that's the name of your product right

313
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,950
explosion helped by optimal software SRO
that's a piece of malware download it

314
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,549
yesterday it's a real thing and you can
also see you know some of the domain

315
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,149
names that they're using also have these
garbage where it's in some the SSL certs

316
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:20,029
the the list of these SSL certs that are
here they were being used by Dyer in one

317
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,130
day

318
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,919
rotating tires now rotating through a
search every five minutes what it's

319
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,480
doing its control and constantly is
regenerating new ones in using those

320
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,159
serbs with garbage sacks lately been
using what looked like the names of

321
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:44,559
people so it will be like Sally Jones as
you're seeing a CNAME garbage but you're

322
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:52,100
not looking for you can see it we're
gonna tell them the server is gonna tell

323
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,830
the end user or the end point that is
retreating a file that is one type of

324
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,559
and then just deliver and other
operating system doesn't care to get to

325
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,450
see it but it can you know it seems as
if to the hard drive and I'll send you

326
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,980
can unzip it and do stuff like that but
if you can I do yes you're in your

327
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,130
policy is to come down you know what
your trust that the server is always

328
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,570
telling the truth you got a problem in
this case it was telling the machine

329
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:25,620
that it was sending a Silverlight plugin
basically a browser

330
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:36,510
/ but it was an executable good is it to
this this campaign in this campaign are

331
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,730
very similar

332
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,920
at first they were doing this fake and
then they realized people started

333
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,210
catching on his three

334
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,210
we can actually see the airline is your
line that's bad machine we're not

335
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:56,309
talking so what do we do we hide my
Harley adding the file with any HTML

336
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:03,170
encoded in base 64 and then we use a
little trick in HTML script name to tell

337
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,840
the browser rendered this is it's
amazingly simple and it works and

338
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:24,340
everybody it's fine just so that I can
extract the information about the email

339
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,449
accounts and then shutting down these
are really like the bottom of the barrel

340
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,830
now where guys that email out these
dealers that the new password still runs

341
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:41,260
on the machine and SMTP ascend the
passwords out out as we're doing all of

342
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,780
this we're seeing the full body of the
message of the credentials everything

343
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,420
they're doing and if you just not
looking for something with keylogger in

344
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,920
the subject line of the album messages
needing your organization there is a

345
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:03,910
couple more so this this one was one
where I was deliberately infecting the

346
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,450
machine and i was just letting you guys
know that I was on to them because it

347
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,150
was sending screenshots back attached
messages I know you guys probably can't

348
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:20,040
see it but it's it's a naughty word this
was a really interesting some guy in

349
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,230
Brazil who you know and I know this but
Brazil is a hotbed of people's bank

350
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,650
credentials it's it's probably the

351
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:35,110
it's the crucible phishing malware in
the world because they just so much of

352
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:45,360
it comes out of their idea I'm gonna use
Microsoft's equal server control and I'm

353
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,169
going to not only export trade my data
using simple commands that secret

354
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,490
service returned back a lot of dates and
other new executable as it as a way of

355
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:03,240
masking it so you're not looking at port
1433 traffic you know why he's somebody

356
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,550
who's in accounting doing database
development which they should not be

357
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,860
called talking to public database
servers that are out on the internet

358
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,860
unless you're doing deep DBA admin in
which case get them passed through the

359
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,209
firewall come on this is this is dead
obvious stuff and it's kind of hard to

360
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,980
see but down here at the bottom you can
see that they actually using simple

361
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,360
commands to do so you know database and
then the server was returning back

362
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,050
something with a few bites at the
beginning that make it look like it

363
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:43,399
wasn't to be and then she had her in
there and you know this . disperse dyes

364
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:51,440
so they're stupid traits but there's
really serious consequences looking for

365
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,740
them and don't catch them because as we
all know these these machines once again

366
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:04,250
infected they're running for weeks
months even years peaking out passwords

367
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,149
being used for sending spam being used
to you know as a foothold within your

368
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,179
network to navigate within the network
into other bad things even though

369
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:19,620
they're done tricks they really bad you
have to watch for them so here's here's

370
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:25,889
my list of best practices right the Eve
Eve be reflexively distrust is like a

371
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,658
personal waterworks basically if you see
something just assume they're lying

372
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,909
until they prove another

373
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:42,750
the file types if you are just make it
happen get the word out that there in

374
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:50,840
these pics piles of programs and they
will expect you if you try to open new

375
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,760
training for your for your steps even
the admins anybody who has email should

376
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,200
be told what to look for when things
look like real concrete example showed

377
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,810
you hear what these messages look like
the document look like that has a Mac

378
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,250
restricted in how does it prompt you
don't think your point because we can

379
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,200
all be in trouble this bad stuff can
happen to anybody so that's a

380
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:24,290
presentation may have arrived at the end

381
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:44,680
five minutes are there any questions
questions ok go ahead

382
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,060
yeah

383
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,380
so the question is it's a lot of data
sharing within the infrastructure to

384
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,710
detect these things it's easy for human
but it's hard for me to do it

385
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,740
yes and no so so for example with that
database thing out now in traffic on

386
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,990
that report there's there's really no
reason for it to be going out anyway and

387
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,169
if there is a particular machine that
needs to use stun like say you got a

388
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:20,330
nice and it needs to do stunts traffic
make sure that the only machine that can

389
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:20,610
do

390
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:27,820
outbound on that stunned and settler
anything else is doing it doesn't have

391
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:33,470
to be really make it harder than that a
lot of cases just finding the weird kind

392
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,609
of traffic that shouldn't be there
looking for those anomalies what was the

393
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:50,710
other person

394
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,810
ok so

395
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,520
examples of Windows malware that's where
the most of it is what ever seen on

396
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,869
Linux I have an idea on a whole lot of
Mexico I'm not out there looking for it

397
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:08,060
so I just don't see very much of it so
that's the sad truth is that there is

398
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,759
some malware out there for Mac and end
at DEFCON this past year there was a

399
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,020
great talk by a guy who basically tore
apart the entire concept of Mac

400
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:24,240
antivirus that the Mac anti malware is
just a shambles it's it's very very easy

401
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,629
for Trojans to sneak past anything in
the Mac because it's over the Menteri

402
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:35,530
that they're just not in some cases it's
just changing one by one and a half or

403
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:41,750
just changing a couple of things in the
filename that gets by a Mack IV and yeah

404
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,310
that's that's an unfortunate truth at
the Lakeside we do see some interesting

405
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:49,330
stuff so there are still people out
there who are trying to shell shocked

406
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:55,140
servers running on the the DMZ segment
in my network and security analytics to

407
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,770
record that traffic and we see a lot of
the shell shocked requests come in

408
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,619
through the user agent so they'll do it
just to get requested the home directory

409
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,520
and then you'll see the shell-shocked
stream inside of that and usually what

410
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,660
we're seeing is coming down from that
are perl based on IRC bots and so then

411
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,118
you just gotta make sure that you don't
have any IRC traffic regardless of the

412
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,270
port that it's talking to them by the
way these things are using weird ports

413
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:35,180
are see traffic from your Linux servers

414
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,808
guys monetize their work

415
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:46,839
chapter credentials is monetized by
collecting all of those credentials and

416
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:50,660
reselling them through the black market
to people who want to use them to then

417
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,190
either hijack servers or hijack other
machines for other mysterious purposes

418
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,290
the guys really banking password
specifically just one login to the bank

419
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:06,279
and financial transfers as quickly as
possible for that is to use two factor

420
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,569
auth so she has some kind of a thing
with your phone or token 22 FAA is the

421
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:15,829
best way to protect against that the
reservoir guys obviously are asking you

422
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:20,650
to get your computer and your data back
and I don't know the report from the FBI

423
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:26,190
they are basically recommending as their
default recommendation for anybody who

424
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:37,110
gets infected with ransom ransom and
that was a lie

425
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,460
ok that was that was apparently bad
recording so here's my take on the whole

426
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,930
brain tumor thing if you keep a good
backup and buy a good backup I need

427
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,480
something that's not mapped to a drive
letter something that you backup

428
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,740
everything on your hard drive and then
specifically disconnected from your

429
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,879
machine

430
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,490
daily or every other day there is
nothing that those rooms where guys can

431
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:03,959
do that you can't just restored within a
day so if you're ok with losing one

432
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,180
day's worth of work and you can deal
with by $89 two terabyte hard drive and

433
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,750
just keeping your stuff back down on it
all the time and then unplugging it when

434
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,310
you're done you really have a problem
for ransom to me the ransomware problem

435
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:23,420
is a problem that is endemic to people
don't want to back so it is kind of a

436
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,710
nuisance but when you lose everything
and we heard cases where there's

437
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,360
enterprises where they have shared
drives mapped drive letters on

438
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,180
everybody's machines and those shared
drives get infected and then everybody's

439
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:44,799
getting corrupted the business you know
financial process of $500 is probably

440
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,040
saved my bacon and restore everything
and if so you know it's unfortunate but

441
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:57,840
sometimes setting the way to get it back

442
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:05,050
any better than it's progenitors next
year but it had some time do you know

443
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,170
program with its more I just barely got
nasty with met with witness town so

444
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:17,490
we're we're introducing in the sandbox
we have the answer we have her in and

445
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,910
we're putting up with us together right
now so we're just testing that but next

446
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:36,730
year

447
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:43,260
question is how easily is it removed and
cleaned or wipe and reload well you know

448
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:50,240
the kind of depends on your risk it for
city if you're very risk-averse and you

449
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,200
don't want to give you 100% guarantee
that there's nothing left on that

450
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,169
machine clean definitely white and green
image to try it it's it's a case where

451
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,920
you've got a piece of malware that on
there it's just sitting in the Windows

452
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,920
directory and you know one of the things
that are RME a dozen here let me show

453
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,930
you were reports that this is this is
that simple

454
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:16,220
that I showed you earlier which was the
one with the nonsense filename this is

455
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,839
what the report looks like from the
Maaco here at the make it a little

456
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:35,550
bigger so it's easier to read like you
can see that the patterns turning point

457
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:48,210
so this is the this is the NAA right and
you could see the patterns that are here

458
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,170
that kind of describe the behaviour that
we consider to be back in kind of like a

459
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,970
brain orders maliciousness and then
there's kind of a final score up here in

460
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:04,569
this case 10 means pants on fire bad
this is one of those cases where we

461
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:08,640
don't actually know whether or not this
is bad we know what other people think

462
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,830
of it and then we kind of early will
determine whether these things are bad

463
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:18,700
based on all of these factors and the
combination of them together will tell

464
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,680
us whether these things about today to
answer that question

465
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,480
questioning how hard is it to clean so
they can this case we're getting this

466
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,760
report and it shows you in the file
system events in the registry events

467
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,540
what it does so it's created a run here
is the one thing you have to do is clean

468
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,060
out the run key and then the other thing
it's doing it showing you all the places

469
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,549
where it copied itself it wrote itself
to the temp directory of road self to

470
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:51,760
program data file name you know path or
whatever

471
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,530
cleaning this up is just delete the
files removed the registry keys reboot

472
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,200
the machine that's how easy it is to
clean this one now a lot of cases where

473
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,990
they're doing things were there
recanting the box are they doing other

474
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,290
stuff you will do all this cleanup
reboot the machine and then you'll still

475
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,410
see the beginning even though everything
you think was gone

476
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,089
has been removed in those cases you have
to wipe reimage the box because there's

477
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,120
no other way to get rid of that now
where it's repeating itself hiding it

478
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,970
from you in the file system but the
reality is the bulk of it

479
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,529
the majority of this stuff is just
sitting in plain view where you can find

480
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:36,950
it and it's just a matter of looking for
clean up pretty quickly these reports

481
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,009
they're not easily if anybody wants to
come up afterwards I could share it with

482
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,570
you but you know this is what DNA does
it it will

483
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,480
take a library executable or actually
any type of file I take a lot of these

484
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,750
were documents and thrown in there and
these arbitrary files it runs them into

485
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,760
VPN and generate this report

486
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,510
let me show you what one of these male
docs looks like so so here's my this is

487
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:22,970
a Windows 7 64 bit okay and here's this
is a malicious itself into Dr this is

488
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:29,520
one that came in this email message this
email was addressed to me personally

489
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:36,430
this was a targeted attack against me so
I had no justifiable reason to want to

490
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:42,569
get rid of it so all I do is just double
click it and word opens now let me

491
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,620
quickly out of this and go over to
Process Explorer which is running you

492
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:55,160
can see right down here at the bottom
there's a payload is your explosion help

493
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,759
it's actually so this is pretty
downloader

494
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,810
I let this thing run for a couple of
minutes you'll see the crypto while

495
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,100
payload will be delivered

496
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,470
running the system and then throw up
that message that says your machine is

497
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,109
infected good at this address

498
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:31,119
yes

499
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:38,190
the comment was

500
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:45,940
X and these ransomware Trojans they'll
run within the user level account

501
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,690
credentials and they could still do
their bad stuff so you don't need admin

502
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:59,970
access it helps the person has no admin
to their machine it certainly helps so

503
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:04,310
here's here's the doc me so when we
first opened it was plain and then after

504
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:09,750
a minute the script brand and it did the
same thing and it says file is protected

505
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,970
by microsoft office please enable
editing content content to see this

506
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:19,450
document on this particular machine I
already have all of the features that

507
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:25,680
would protect you from that grows turned
off I have a needle all macros not

508
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,440
recommended potentially dangerous I can
assure you it is definitely dangerous to

509
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,090
have to setting enabled right but
there's all these protections for

510
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:40,260
ActiveX controls plugins where you trust
documents things are designed to thwart

511
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,720
these attacks all it takes is one person
who's Craigslist the message inside the

512
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:53,480
text field here to let this happen to
themselves so that are affected by think

513
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:04,720
it's probably let's see what it's doing
some time next person's talking about

514
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:11,370
nine minutes I think I need to get out
of here that where r and there's there's

515
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:17,460
a little stray console that they left
open its not clear whether or not this

516
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,790
thing is actually going to do anything
but inside it dropped and executed

517
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:37,460
that's that's simple questions

518
00:48:37,460 --> 00:49:06,290
me that's based in Brazil URL which is
likely lol Brazil contact them and once

519
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:14,170
they realized within walking four types
of logins is used the same streaming in

520
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:21,240
both the strings in the in the file
itself in the path where he built now

521
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,979
where that we're also the user name on
the database server and so is this guy

522
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:34,310
who used the handle which is low in
Portuguese and so a new look for glow or

523
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:40,740
some combination in Leeds in Portuguese
they would love to look for it and shut

524
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,598
them down and then they started
proactively shutting them down as soon

525
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,770
as the new ones have created and shut
down for about two months now but you

526
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:55,160
know and the guys that you will get
complacent and then he'll figure out

527
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,149
there using his same hacker handle the
signed in and it will change is handled

528
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:05,250
by a different character in there
because again stupid tricks work even

529
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:12,760
against good guys actually so you ask a
lot of questions

530
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,390
music CD or sticker here and then I
think you for your time and please if

531
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,759
you if you like the talk to you the
little survey and let the guys here no

532
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,490
such as me back
