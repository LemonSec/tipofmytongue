1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:24,349
everybody hear me alright so what I want
to represent today was decrypting SL

2
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:37,820
traffic in the villages i'll start I
guess this is mrs. me I'm husband

3
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,129
forgives programmer analyst i can make
her over analytical person who doesn't

4
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,399
always think things just kind of who i
am i'm sure relating to some of you out

5
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:04,370
there my name is Daniel LTE and let's go
over some exercise

6
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,570
can everybody raise your hand you raise
your hand a little bit

7
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,920
all right good ok can you stand up

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,350
sorry I guys but I suppose I know that
you all can will you all stand up

9
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,699
alright so my idea of them so you can
start you can sit down my idea what this

10
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,700
was a workshop and so I wanted to be
able to interact with with people and

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,950
wanted to make sure that other people
can interact with other people to make

12
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,979
sure that we get this understood

13
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:55,189
it's beginning I had seen online that it
was possible to to use your browser to

14
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,750
decrypt the traffic that you're sending
back and forth as if you open up

15
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,369
wireshark when you're trying to do this
and it doesn't it doesn't catch it

16
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,560
doesn't know what's going on

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,209
so these slides are available on to the
conference so if you want to take a

18
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,650
picture that you can if you want to
download the PDF and then click on the

19
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:27,739
link you can't but I always had problems
actually getting it to work I would

20
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,079
follow the different steps and then
things just weren't working so i decided

21
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:41,569
back down this and this actually helped
me to do what I wanted to do so i'm

22
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:49,940
going to steal a bunch of his stuff and
so on that link you go to he chose you

23
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:59,269
this this example of work of some vessel
traffic duty he has and it's all just

24
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,269
jumbled since then

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,890
so I guess let's go back so i traded
time I had a server that was that was

26
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,649
using SSL and i was able to get the the
private key because well you know I want

27
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,239
to manage it i try to use that private
key then put into the wireshark command

28
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,459
dreaded can see the traffic in my web
browser and submit it still it still

29
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:38,099
didn't work so apparently he they may
use the certificates to create some sort

30
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:45,060
of pre master key and then it's that
that secondary session key but then is

31
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,549
transferred back and for used to encrypt
the traffic back and forth and so that's

32
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,769
why I couldn't do it

33
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:59,280
the there's a resource slide that I have
at the end of this that explains in more

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,840
detail about how to do this and why it
works and stuff like that

35
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,950
see ya firefox and chrome I i know they
work I don't know about any other

36
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:22,590
browser so what happens is you can you
have an environment variable but you

37
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:31,198
said and then when the browser goes to
some SL cider it starts up then it says

38
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,639
okay I'm gonna don't my SLPs to to the
file be specified in the environment

39
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:49,770
variable so depending on how you do it
you may have to start your web browser

40
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:57,150
from the terminal if your mac or linux
appear windows that should just kind of

41
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,150
work so

42
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,830
let's do some experiments and try to get
this to work

43
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:23,558
yeah so who here has a windows machine
in front of them and so this these next

44
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:31,180
couple slides will be for you to help
you go through the the process a lot of

45
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,180
us have done environment variables

46
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,999
this is the name it has to be all caps
at half-speed specifically SL key log

47
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,650
while and then you tell us where to go

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,860
that it ok so so I wanted to make sure
that everyone has everyone who wanted to

49
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:07,320
do this as they had the time to do it
and then if you're on a Mac or Linux is

50
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
the way to do it

51
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,740
so if you in in here if you do export
necessarily blood keyfile log file then

52
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:41,000
you have to use firefox from within the
terminal and then it'll dump it that was

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,009
where I was having issues before i was
doing the export and then trying to

54
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:53,599
start firefox from my was already open
was always started and so then that

55
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:03,199
didn't it wasn't something the file it
looks like if you do the The Bachelor

56
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:11,060
see file and you put the be a variable
in there and then log out log back in

57
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:18,110
maybe we started firebox and that will
come up and that'll work

58
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,980
and then with maggots a similar
situation

59
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,119
you know that works in them i don't know
about emacs editor you know I don't

60
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:41,809
really know much about macs and then so
has everybody who wanted to gotten this

61
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:48,349
far to raise your hands of someone who
wanted to do this but couldn't couldn't

62
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,349
do it

63
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,138
so it's very possible that we will get
done

64
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:06,750
30 because i was expecting more
interactions more trial-and-error heavy

65
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,530
on the other side but in theory all this
is fine it's just if you don't go

66
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,388
through it then you made it snacks and
stuff and it's better if you hit the

67
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:30,180
snags with a lot of help around you but
yeah so then in white shirt you go edit

68
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:40,380
preferences and you going to the
protocol section SL and then that's

69
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,490
where you but the browse to the file
that was dumped

70
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,140
if it's not dumping things then you
don't have anything to put here

71
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:06,620
I don't remember that it and then so
after that after you going to do that

72
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:16,550
and then you can open up be the pcap
again and then you'll see another an

73
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:24,290
extra tab that wasn't there before and
it's called encrypted ssl data so then

74
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:33,020
you can see the the data that goes back
and forth with back using my resources

75
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,250
this is the one that I have found that
actually helped me to get this to work

76
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,590
this is one from Mozilla says hey this
is what this is how you do it

77
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,740
this is right

78
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,850
yeah this can be done i do that for a
while I just couldn't figure out how and

79
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,400
then this is another one from I suppose
some sounds that kind of gives you a

80
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,250
higher overview

81
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,840
I mean at the similar situation to what
I've explained maybe in a little bit

82
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:23,480
more detail and then this one is like 20
page paper on how to do this and delves

83
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,380
into more

84
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:35,450
for the details and that's my
presentation I I wasn't expecting a

85
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:47,810
presentation but more of a demonstration
so if yes

86
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,880
yeah

87
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,680
you specified it but it needs to be
something that the wires that a firebox

88
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,709
can write 2 and then it needs to be
something that you can access with the

89
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,310
with white shirt

90
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
great

91
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,379
yeah

92
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,210
ok

93
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,950
so get a little spit out a bunch of
different keys in that file you have

94
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:04,670
different different websites and stuff
and so than Ben that was different as

95
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:11,360
different key if they talking different
protocol then you may have a couple of

96
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,270
keys in there for the same same website
but it's on that same file so if you

97
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,960
take that file and throw it into wires
shirt then it will help you to encrypted

98
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:46,629
yes so this is not a yeah I do

99
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,470
it's not that you're accepting a
different search your just your

100
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,110
everything was normal that as far as
certain concerning you're just seeing

101
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:04,240
what concert is and then using that to
decrypt the track of how many more

102
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,470
questions

103
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,590
yes

104
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,030
yeah

105
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,319
yeah

106
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:21,080
so in denver VI yes

107
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,819
so the question is what when you use
them in this environment variable or in

108
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:36,080
this place here what you put into the
file you would just use the same texting

109
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,440
during the same text right here

110
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,900
SLP log file equals than that

111
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:58,189
yeah so that's about musical persist
over restarts and then it's it's a few

112
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:04,490
right to this file right that s so he
logged thing and then log out log back

113
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:14,690
in and then it will be there and you
should be able to dump these files so is

114
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,750
there anyone that is attempted to do
this and has gotten stuck

115
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,519
is there anyone that's working on it

116
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:44,310
good so I yesterday i found out that
works we will we'll have a created seems

117
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,500
to fit for were sweet and then you can
use that as a prophecy and then you can

118
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,740
then see the traffic you see I'm trying
to troubleshoot something that you own

119
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,700
that you know is gonna you're gonna
trust that that CA sert then then you

120
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,970
can use purple sweet that's maybe a
little bit easier than this

121
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:15,240
we the major issue that that I see with
this is the environment variables can be

122
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:24,300
changed without really you knowing and
so this could then be done so that year

123
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:32,250
that sell keys are being logged to a
file without you knowing so there is

124
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,180
evidence of it happening and that's that
that environment variable so if you know

125
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,209
that it's there and you say that
shouldn't be there then

126
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:55,660
you can go through the same process and
just delete it if it is there so there's

127
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,360
still people working on it

128
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,720
that's the best times for there's not
much more content so if you are it's

129
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,640
interested with everything else then
you're free to go to sea horses

130
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:23,260
yeah

131
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,740
yeah

132
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,560
yeah

133
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,560
yeah

134
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,560
so who thinks that they understand this
and make it possibly help someone else

135
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,199
out

136
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,980
ok so it could you those that could you
stand up if you think you understand it

137
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,720
and you could have possibly help someone
else will you please stand up and then

138
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,810
if you need help then could you raise
your hand and then someone else here

139
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,810
could could help you out

140
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:19,659
well pretty confident in our skills or
we don't want to admit that we need help

141
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:27,669
in either way sign all first apartments

142
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,220
yeah

143
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,410
yeah

144
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,559
yeah
