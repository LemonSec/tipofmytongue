1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:11,650
networks now HP Enterprise as of
November person so thank you for coming

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:19,490
obviously the topic is and some of the
things that people are better understand

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,250
about new ideas of the things that
people sort of neglect to become so if

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,890
you look at the agenda today we're gonna
do we gonna talk about some of the

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,690
trends are happening I do a lot of
presentations with customers to our

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,849
executive briefing center to talk to
people are concerned would you know BYD

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:49,430
men's aspects as well so how does an IG
person designated you know who can bring

8
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,350
up to you

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,530
device in chiapas who can all boarded
when they hit on board it as a device

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,920
that you know I'm bored and then what
they can actually get to talk a little

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,390
bit about that the devices themselves
that continuously they're still in there

12
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,760
they belong to us right so theoretically
we can download anything we wanted these

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:22,570
devices applications that could be
secure a guitar tuner on here that God

14
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,679
knows who made it but it was free so I
downloaded it right it's probably

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,500
something I should use of the corporate
network but not that I do it on a

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,540
computer or I have it on my phone and
then there's issues around anything that

17
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,180
you bring it to the environment now the
fact that most of you were at the office

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:52,640
of the new work at home right now and
then these devices iPhones pretty

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,460
three-quarters about Samsung devices
usually the next big thing right and

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:05,408
everything else drives up anybody have a
blackberry no immediate threat street

21
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:13,709
somebody like to get a blackberry you
cannot dedicate any device right but

22
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,330
there are some services that would agree
not to be able to use like an onboarding

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,560
service because of a close-in API how
about when does anybody one brave soul

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,170
that's great to get to it usually one or
two so they don't have a DVI either so

25
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,619
if your night see person you had an
expected him to come to you and you

26
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,650
manually going on but his device which
you've got to go change the settings for

27
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,650
double text you have to create CCSID
etcetera

28
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,290
so any kind of authentication backend
though you know a radically you want to

29
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,579
say policy management system to be able
to authenticate device which does work

30
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,920
and then we're gonna talk about
something called but we're calling it

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,760
out to trust defense and the idea there
is that you do something like a policy

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,329
management server

33
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,360
solves one problem

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:13,850
anybody using nvm on their devices 12 30
the idea there is that when I talk to

35
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,100
people they think that solving be going
and talking to MobileIron AirWatch

36
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:27,709
subjects of writing other vendors and
that's also the only problem is I get so

37
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,959
it's gonna take multiple security
solutions in order to help you would be

38
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,840
wider problem and the fact that
everybody is mobile you have different

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,840
roles with your company's I'm in
marketing and sales I don't need to see

40
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,000
the information that big season he has a
different style than 90 he's always on

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,860
the road I'm on the road occasionally so
it's it's amazing that you'll get people

42
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,160
into our office they're traveling a lot
and they basically say that I T will not

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,100
give them the same access when they're
on the road as well then when they're in

44
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,650
the office and I like not even with the
VPN service that they ought to date no

45
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,360
they don't

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,459
the fact that I should have access to
information on the Internet it doesn't

47
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,450
make sense today so we'll talk a little
bit about that and then we'll talk about

48
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,289
policy management its role and has a
little time reviewing

49
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:32,080
so today's trends start if you look at
the looking at it from the left hand

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,479
side against your lips as well

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,180
the idea that you at ease sort of scary
everybody from top down if you go to be

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,220
top executives are afraid of what he
means people can bring their own devices

53
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,600
different types of devices the IgG me to
manage each and every one of them does

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,910
he helped me to understand how each and
every one of them work and the fact that

55
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,990
its mobile you're taking it home you're
bringing the office you basically take

56
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,710
your love you might set it on your desk
and you walk away you go and you take

57
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,210
with your phone and you go to a meeting
at a conference room where you take it

58
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,500
in a cafeteria I mean you left upset
that you're done so because you know

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,770
you're moving what happens that devices
on the bus is something comes up your

60
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,630
laptop and such knowledge that you get
while you're away from your laptop will

61
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,000
let you know that somebody side to
factor authentication anybody using

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,120
back-propagation network access as well
as application access one guy said yes

63
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,160
to suggest network application peace
like a duo that

64
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,610
other considerations that people don't
think about so in this room maybe what

65
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,090
about about the fact that what happens
when I'm mobile and I'm trying to reach

66
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,440
the upper case and what i mean the
opposite out of the office and maybe

67
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,140
it's a cloud out do I require somebody
to go and authenticated or on the rise

68
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,479
of back that somebody is going to go sup
bitch something that you need to

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:20,390
consider as well and then the absence so
that you can go to a generic thats or

70
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,669
download download any apps are you
allowed to bring their own enterprise

71
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:34,170
network gaming out anybody doing betting
apps there is rare

72
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,410
there are other apps as well that when I
asked people to raise their hands and

73
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,120
it's a fact that they can do it it's a
personal device right if you are

74
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,140
watching every commercial is almost you
being part of the game right you getting

75
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,150
so a lot of those out so who goes from
God knows everybody knows how many outs

76
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:02,739
there are of Angry Birds Seasons Angry
Birds I guess almost 20

77
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,050
and I heard that there may be one that
is an unsecured so anybody that's using

78
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,940
something like that because they're
letting their kids put it on their phone

79
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,610
and then the rocking chair environment
with the basically an open up as

80
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,520
possibly an hour but people don't think
about that because it's just you I D and

81
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,960
you're not going to have somebody like
downloading at bringing to enterprises

82
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,710
are smart users right but said he would
go so those kind of issues you have to

83
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,169
consider as well you have to figure out
how to manage rejected forgot how to

84
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,370
manage without you being in the middle
of it all so you need to look at

85
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:49,150
automated tools device awesome data
people lose the device every day

86
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,698
constantly so you live in hotels you
leave him in airports you leaving in

87
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,889
taxes there's still on a continuous
basis I live in the Bay Area it's not

88
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:06,349
uncommon to hear that somebody was on a
company's learn better data alone being

89
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:15,090
your enterprise information is everybody
is a pin code

90
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:23,080
lot of people raising their hands in our
industry you should have your phone I'm

91
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,510
gonna say something ladies don't get mad
but I guess is the worse than not having

92
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:36,529
to pick up ladies and you know the
reason why they don't like codes as a

93
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,840
dirty the screen

94
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:48,090
make it but they basically just pick it
up if so there are ways that you can do

95
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:54,140
you think about it right thing about
these weird stuff but the idea that a

96
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,510
pin code you can use and MGM pool
junction with the access he said lets

97
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,540
you connect to a network in order to
ensure that the users sort of doing the

98
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,130
right thing and then you're doing the
right thing to do on your network and

99
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,480
then malware and apt the whole thing is
the fact that the people are getting

100
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,500
smarter they realize that you are not
the most secure we're not thinking along

101
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,280
the lines of wine all the time we're
thinking about ourselves

102
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,339
most of the time to do things like go to
an airport connects to the free WiFi

103
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,360
network and not turn out to be so
they're looking for things that we're

104
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,170
doing that would just not aware of so
you have to do with that as well

105
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,209
again would you want to do you want to
make sure that again you're using

106
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:53,610
automation you're using firewalls tools
and I guess what you're hoping to make

107
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,900
smarter because they understand that
things are evolving as well we'll talk a

108
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,310
little bit more about that later

109
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,949
and then the guest wifi piece I've tried
start there are usually open now and why

110
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,540
they opened up what's at stake and
quarterly 25 minutes ago network devices

111
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:19,380
are down its it doesn't make any sense
so you figure out how to make me smarter

112
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,810
without me to do anything you're gonna
model may be the engine started and

113
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,900
you're not gonna basis based at all on
visiting a client it could be me

114
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,900
initiating an application and then
automatically building so we'll talk

115
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,240
about ways you can do that as well

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:48,400
the endpoint dilemma I'm a little older
than me who it was that you and I G do

117
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,800
everything for you they took gold in him
they had its your lap all you have to do

118
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,339
is login all the applications you use
were already there all the

119
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,680
infrastructure was already there all the
settings brody built for you but it

120
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,599
doesn't work like that anymore you go to
the store you buy your own device you go

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,230
to the store again you by the time I got
a customer in the same store in New York

122
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,089
City as the Apple Store financial
organization they don't allow they did

123
00:11:23,089 --> 00:12:19,699
not allow wife

124
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:26,919
create a policy that sends me the
internet if that's all you want and then

125
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,730
you can probably doing the internet
because you can set you up

126
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,910
levels investment levels or what I'm
doing with this everybody understands

127
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,799
that but the idea is that you don't want
to create has ideas like the password

128
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:49,579
for dealing with anybody

129
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:59,360
when you wanted to deploy something you
you said right and the new route between

130
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,470
routers a lot of sense but now what you
want to do is to want to be able to go

131
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:12,400
this advice does three different big
boys school data to the video to get a

132
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,329
better idea

133
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:21,680
hold in a holding pattern based on the
fact that I'm you see a video

134
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,680
application been that traffic was done
video so there are things to consider

135
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:38,569
that outside of everything you do in USA
tu ideas I decide the road and bacon

136
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,850
differentiate when I get to this device
device and they give me different

137
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,370
qualities of both devices as well but
the ideas you have to know what devices

138
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,220
those are you can rely on polls triple-a
components ago oh I see trend connect to

139
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,670
the network is I don't really know that
Allah knows that somebody connected my

140
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,870
game an IP address in today's world what
you want to do is you want to go

141
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:10,220
person connected and he connected with
the and many connected with laptop and

142
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,130
many connected with the game consoles
and then he connected with an iPad or

143
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,770
some kind of those how goes on and on

144
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,199
to see if you're new diversity and you
want to know how to differentiate

145
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,390
between had something else to propel the
web

146
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:36,550
the user behavior I trust upon before
here where our worst enemy anything

147
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,020
about lost mobile devices within last
two years

148
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,300
13 were you guys are really good

149
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,689
typically more hands up in the air and
it's just the fact that happens right I

150
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,100
was going to the airport the other day I
left uninsured

151
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,190
yes they so we accept people are nice

152
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,140
the idea is that when you lose that
phone did you ever painted on it maybe

153
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,850
maybe not

154
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:16,180
what's the first thing you do when you
find a smartphone and if you log in what

155
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:24,469
do you look at search that's usually
it's usually check out the pictures

156
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,830
could be good could be really bad so I
suggest again can come in concert gonna

157
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:36,450
go away though I'm on an older home but
nowadays you can use to print them

158
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:44,230
actually got started on the back nine
codes may go way we're going to this to

159
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,860
back with that again it could be said

160
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,620
considered one part of the viewer to
sector potentially significant work had

161
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,330
been printed in schools kids are gonna
basically not used to encode their gonna

162
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:04,990
use like vegetables you gonna see like
picking monkey gorilla and that is your

163
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,170
login authentication code that is cool

164
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:14,800
Active Directory don't want you to
remember the passwords they don't want

165
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,420
you know somebody to be above the liquid
password so they're just going to use

166
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,050
this thing and they're gonna make it
more things are changing and I think

167
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,040
they're changing for the better

168
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,530
younger users are less responsible right
I got a kid who was 20 born she didn't

169
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:42,060
care about much except your car you know
if you look at it from the trip side who

170
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,569
has potentially would give their
password wait for you know a large sum

171
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,020
of money

172
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:55,220
younger person older person it's usually
the older person and why because the

173
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,710
older person retired would say that the
other person like myself you know you're

174
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:07,440
a director or VP you have better
information to spell so from my

175
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,650
perspective it can walk down you know
the VP of channel locks down you know

176
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,540
director so what you can do it you can
also differentiate what I get to one of

177
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,550
my mobile device but I store my mobile
device

178
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:29,990
office

179
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:37,280
to happen you wouldn't answer laptop
over to somebody like he's in his laptop

180
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,129
right now he's not hadn't heard anybody
but because it makes it here using my

181
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,640
phone so somebody could look at
something that you're not supposed to be

182
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,400
looking at we just got on board an HP
we're giving these new letters so have a

183
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,710
look

184
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,360
god help us all information on them do
you want to share that with the world

185
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,689
maybe maybe not the ideas that we're so
giving that you have to protect as I D

186
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,300
people you have to protect us against
ourselves the next thing is I T is

187
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:18,350
concerned that the idea who's afraid of
what type of devices and then how do I

188
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:25,040
control access to those specific devices
I get it all the time if I let people

189
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,220
everything

190
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,919
well yes and no as ITV will you are the
ones that are you know designating what

191
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,559
kind of rules to live by the idea though
that you ought to make those you don't

192
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,870
want to like put up posters in the break
room anymore that doesn't work but if

193
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,408
you build a policy says sales people can
on board three devices marketing people

194
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:52,679
get on board two devices and I
understand that because it sort of makes

195
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:59,460
its way around that is so it's not every
device some customers that doesn't mean

196
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,850
that you can only have the devices on a
network when you are bored them for

197
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,389
Samsung devices only because they've
already gone it tested without the

198
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:17,140
device will you can watch them for such
as well so BYD also impacts your wild

199
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,090
wireless network in the past you walk up
to somebody you'd say you know how many

200
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:30,899
devices on your network so you have
separate value networks using a tool

201
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,260
that basically goes out and touches
every device to go in my life I see how

202
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,360
many on your device I see how many
printers if you get a help desk all

203
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,039
people are complaining about been with
the jews you can narrow it down to an

204
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,580
area and then you can look at it go like
in the common areas here if you have

205
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,949
five thousand people can act as a
problem you can only tell it you know

206
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,320
what kind of devices are doing with them

207
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,539
we talked about MGM and brake controls
everybody know the difference between

208
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:15,210
MGM and EMM hands-on yes that's good
actually

209
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:23,240
so MGM MGM is basically an agent that
sits on your device and this is what you

210
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,870
load this is what you have everybody
download when you on board a device

211
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,018
controls and the idea that you could
track usage you can track where the

212
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:40,639
devices you can set up something that it
plans to designate that I can't go over

213
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:48,090
a certain amount of minutes you can
designate where you can just type outs

214
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,799
wireless setup so they can have an
iPhone black was set-ups you can do

215
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,250
jailbreaks do you think so

216
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,029
century to the phone itself but it
didn't give you enough didn't give you

217
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:07,200
enough controls so they sort of migrated
something called a memory enterprise

218
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,980
mobility management and now that starts
looking at the applications themselves

219
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:18,570
if you designate a particular
application leads to have a VPN and it

220
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,570
started as soon as you open that out you
would do something like EMM and there's

221
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,730
this idea of a container

222
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,450
understand what it considers

223
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,950
container is the idea that because it's
my phone I'm gonna split the phone in

224
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:41,350
the container is the piece that I would
allow you to do so I wouldn't be able as

225
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,669
I teach you designate what kind of
browser you using I'm it up if anybody

226
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,910
knows something about a company called
good made and tell you what kind of

227
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,170
email updates that you can use while in
the container so it's not separating

228
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:03,220
personal enterprise so that there are
there's a fine line or privacy because

229
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,300
what happens is that once you start
letting agents on devices you just get a

230
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,720
little paranoid on what I do like she
cannot see everything that's one of the

231
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
things that you guys need to understand
you guys can see what kind of

232
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,700
applications people that running because
they're going to initiate traffic and

233
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,380
your fellow of the water while you're
over 50 can tell you if any of the games

234
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:32,210
because the ideas that MGM was sort of
built for the idea that these are always

235
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,639
roaming

236
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:37,059
so when you're making a cellular
connection and european beauty into a

237
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,719
corporate environment that's here
regardless if you connected to a WiFi

238
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:45,929
network or wired network then you need
something like a policy management

239
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:54,690
system which basically do the component
of I've jumped off the cellular network

240
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:01,379
and I've connected to wifi wired network
now whether or not I'm gonna give people

241
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:10,418
access if this device is jailbroken and
the UN agencies and jailbroken devices

242
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:16,109
that's how you stop that if you're just
using MGM and you want to keep people

243
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:22,509
off of WiFi network your option is
turned up wi-fi radio in this it's not

244
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:30,350
the most elegant thing

245
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,469
you're thinking about BYD it's not 10
you can have to look at what we call

246
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,870
secure mobility and you're gonna have to
look at multiples

247
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:49,530
and then there's the whole idea of
protection as well so if you're doing

248
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,340
and p.m. start if you're doing the
policy management control component it's

249
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,770
better but the policy management
component gets on the network and

250
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,300
typically they're out of bed so what do
you need you need you know your

251
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,530
firewalls you need to IPS schools to
look at that specific traffic as well

252
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:14,000
regardless regardless of its view Audi
or not it could be a nice you see you

253
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,860
start to look at that traffic and you
start looking for anomalies if you see

254
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:26,729
something that doesn't based on an
application that you go then you have to

255
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,210
like start creating policies on your
firewalls in relation to mobile users

256
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,600
and you can't do anything to mobile user
at all you know is an IP address and

257
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,209
theoretically what you can you can also
do is you can browse their device and

258
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,730
network with firewall blocked traffic
and you can quarantine traffic but

259
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,400
you're not gonna be able to do anything
to device person still under now say the

260
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,210
idea there is that BYOD protection

261
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,250
approach to the fact that a firewall
will see an anomaly in detail the policy

262
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:11,750
management system something this device
that belongs trend is an iPod and I want

263
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:19,900
you about site users so again looking at
a third component right there's multiple

264
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,180
components

265
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,920
so lonely talk about a depth of trust
the idea that all these components need

266
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,250
to work together and you need to adapt
Street different scenarios like I said

267
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,310
he travels more than I do in the office
or we have people and the opposite never

268
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,159
leave the office they are happy to be in
the office they never work should they

269
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,440
be given the same privileges should be
you know how the same down with bodies

270
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,030
possibly for you know doing something on
a laptop that's video related possibly

271
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:06,780
not so you need to it out to those such
scenarios for business reasons not based

272
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,080
in fact that you know what your
components can you cannot do they need

273
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,159
to be more flexible the whole idea of a
depth of trust that a base-level nobody

274
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,970
gets you nowhere right that's never good
but you have to differentiate between

275
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,470
executive staff member because you're
gonna hear about it if you don't have to

276
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,900
deny this is getting onto the network
that's not gonna be on your front door

277
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,990
in 10 minutes resentment will be worse
the ideas that you need to be flexible

278
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,740
enough and you need to take advantage of
all your security and research there now

279
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:50,420
that you're talking about the firewall
at the perimeter doesn't anymore for

280
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,710
what we're talking about that not
everybody is looking to get in through

281
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,730
your internet access would like to have
it there basically getting smarter and

282
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,630
they're saying it takes it with them
everywhere he goes and he walks

283
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,700
adorning the next to the governor that's
what I want

284
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,390
so

285
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,470
basically just put it together and says
look at all levels and i'm i'm talking

286
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,790
about so far maybe three but if you look
at the site it talks about the white

287
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:31,320
Mike as well as anybody running through
my mind the idea there is that a long

288
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,740
time ago we went down this route of
using role days enforcement so the idea

289
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,590
that it's not just to be lantern ACL I'm
gonna look at who somebody's identity is

290
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,320
to look at the device and I'm gonna give
it a role as well today's model for

291
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,149
securing mobile is that I have a role of
this as a role and you what you want to

292
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:59,020
do is you wanna be a management system
that extends that your wifi equipment as

293
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,060
well as your bbm and your wife how many
people are doing dominance under wired

294
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:14,750
infrastructure you so the idea there in
some girls who was a beauty and the

295
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:20,030
other day came in their deployment our
next on the wifi and I said what you

296
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:28,470
gonna do in the next not really once you
go down the wired wireless and you have

297
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,510
to configure your switches were politics
anyway

298
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,000
as well as radius radius your way you
can do about me

299
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,120
versus a balance on this whole room
you've already set up your wired

300
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,879
infrastructure so you can go and create
policies required as well so you can

301
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,860
take roles that you created in the white
side and you can apply that to you can

302
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,139
say enforcement going to be different
under wired switch because it is

303
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,600
different vs a wireless controller with
the idea that you don't want me to

304
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,139
unplug the printer and plug in and I get
a Mac says the printer that's not good

305
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,360
so what you want to do it again you want
a ride to roll for me and my devices no

306
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:18,100
matter where i plug in your gonna say he
gets access this for the network not so

307
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,980
you start thinking along those lines

308
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,690
well how to type person and a device
into an important it doesn't take a lot

309
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:34,810
but you think about it beforehand and
services to people all work from home or

310
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,759
how like groups of people that just work
from home

311
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,559
we get a lot of BC like transcriptions
for health care insurance agents they

312
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,989
may never go to an office they were
going home there's another component

313
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:53,519
that you can use something that a result
called it a remote access for you and

314
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,639
it's basically a small AP that looks
like something you'd plug into the back

315
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,809
of your DSL line and the idea there's
that you're gonna extend your has

316
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:11,069
decided to your home two groups small
remote office to help the hotel room

317
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:16,428
something like this and it pushes the
same SSID just like you were in your

318
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:21,859
office or home so instead of having to
go and create innovate grodin bpm for

319
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:29,529
each device just connected it back you
authenticate against the same policy

320
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:36,379
management server you basically get up
indicated the same way she rocked

321
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:44,998
directory make sure that you're a real
person while I come in from Florida Bay

322
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,690
had a guy pretending to be a doctor

323
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,360
and actually meeting with patients
another network but he wasn't even in

324
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,758
the Active Directory so they got a
martyr and they went to an application

325
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,879
that when you add you as a patient
walked in and you can see doctors within

326
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,639
the hospital you can actually see their
picture would save upwards Active

327
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:14,750
Directory then you know that it's a real
doctor what they had to do that this guy

328
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,600
was pretending to be a doctor for a
couple weeks in their office so you guys

329
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,059
get more creative because people are
pretty greater on the last thing on this

330
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:35,759
site is simple tools by using our site
or do you read a couple people ability

331
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,320
means that you're gonna get a lot of
more information as well because people

332
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,850
are real indicating a lot everybody
knows but University of Ohio so they get

333
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,610
take a wild guess their own about their
medications a day because they have kids

334
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:01,040
moving to pass the phone number

335
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:08,360
million

336
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:20,409
very three million just constantly
moving quite small little campus they

337
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,600
were getting three hundred and something
dollars in many cases a day with the

338
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,110
student body and I think it was eight
thousand people number one that had a

339
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,000
cold Cisco network that was in control
debate so every time he will move it was

340
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,520
like a medication night where they've
had six children but you have to plan

341
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,440
for stuff like that is if you don't
think about it it's gonna take your

342
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,960
network down to nothing and it's based
on the fact that these things again

343
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,900
unpredictable when are people going to
use them where they could use and what

344
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,910
they're going to do how many people are
in the EU 123 we had a school in

345
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:08,190
Saturday's grade school kids right it's
a great school that you pay $50,000

346
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:16,299
you're good to go to suggest wifi they
took everybody in the cafeteria and

347
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:22,029
their heads and they told me do whatever
they wanted for a minute or two

348
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:28,570
98% of the ones here too so basically
killing a network as well so you want to

349
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,840
be able to do is use a policy management
system again to work with your wifi

350
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,580
equipment to ensure that you're giving
the quality of service to everybody

351
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,939
based on their role so again you could
use students or teachers vs and if

352
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,210
you're doing it correctly you're just
using the same SSID per step features

353
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,919
but you're probably fair bandwidth that
you're giving them a performance that

354
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,080
you that you are correct then the
students you gonna do something special

355
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,449
because you don't want to be good and
you don't want to be with you again you

356
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:16,449
don't wanna created for every instance
you want to use the power of the match

357
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:23,799
so nice exchange something that in the
product that we sell we give you an API

358
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,639
that allows you to work with other
vendors it's built into the product

359
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,839
doesn't cost you anything but the idea
is more popular vendors like powell the

360
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:42,089
MobileIron AirWatch juniper checkpoint
we've gone out we've tested how you can

361
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:46,699
take and educate me coming out of the
network and you can share my information

362
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:52,989
would be so their tools so that they're
making a decision based on an IP address

363
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:58,250
and they're basically have the ability
to use it for granular so they're not

364
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,530
creating a policy for thousands of
people there creating policies for

365
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:10,890
groups of people so that again you can
adapt our workforce the idea at the very

366
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:19,129
bottom for the right and best of breed
nowhere

367
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,920
when I asked a lot of people have died
have Cisco wired as well but what do you

368
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,240
do for baseball something we sell
something works in any environment if

369
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,308
you can take their solutions how to put
into our environment

370
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:42,369
buddy you have to buy an extra
components his own again it was built on

371
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:45,440
the premise that it was going to work
for Cisco and it was gonna work for

372
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,369
other vendors the torch they came from a
group of people that went out they used

373
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:57,460
to work at six so it's very multi-vendor
friendly and again the idea of you at

374
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,730
ease that you have to work with
different firewall vendors IPS vendors

375
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:12,670
vendors at the very bottom here are some
say a logo multi-factor again it's

376
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,779
becoming very popular again

377
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:18,789
gonna start seeing more information
about the exact authentication and

378
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:24,970
multi-factor authentication two factor
authentication could be that you are

379
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:31,828
right we Active Directory and then you
authorize what I can actually get to by

380
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:36,090
using a single database that's tied to
my device

381
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:42,440
thats to factor it doesn't have to be
complicated you maybe not have to not

382
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,430
have to go buy extra what you need to
think about what you're doing when you

383
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:54,460
say buddy in the government right you're
getting sort of pushed to the fact that

384
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,850
you need to use a multi-factor federal
government level because they reach so

385
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,140
now they're saying that you must
initiate you factor out a used eckardt's

386
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,339
they use a variety of different things
that we support its making a comeback so

387
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,820
think about that

388
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:35,290
itself is a replacement for you or
anybody running Cisco ACS

389
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,450
triple-a you also get programming that's
built in boarding component was a guest

390
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,339
component if you want to have to get
them on your network and just say you

391
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:52,590
know i i acceptance use they don't have
to go through I D person they don't have

392
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,520
to go through a reception as they do it
themselves that's part of the base no

393
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,900
plans as well you can deploy it so that
it's remote have clustered that's good

394
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,420
and its local the ideas that you put it
on hardware or you can put it on your

395
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,390
own hardware used to be in there are a
lot of components within the policy

396
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,420
management server the ideas that you
don't want to have to pay for everything

397
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,590
separately we don't do that we saw you
license compliance a lot of components

398
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:33,850
built in the this idea here's what I was
talking about before as well

399
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,210
instead of creating separatists aidid
for BYD take advantage of the fact that

400
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,260
if you buy most men system you can
differentiate based on who I am with the

401
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,210
devices and I don't have to go to
another as you make it easier for you

402
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,240
use it well and then

403
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,859
and this was just an example from a
customer marian was using MobileIron as

404
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:01,260
well as the best solution the idea there
is that we're coming out of two points

405
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,650
as well like I talked about before

406
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:13,810
BYOD mobility again on one task to be
multiples and here are some examples of

407
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:20,000
larger customers and I won't talk about
it with them one at a time and the idea

408
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,150
is that you have to think of it from two
different aspects while I'm connected to

409
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,580
the network and when I'm not connected
to the network PID stays connected

410
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:37,150
everywhere at the airport at those oh
it's no longer just when I walked into

411
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,030
the office

412
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:44,030
your problems are bigger than that so
that I done and I hope I didn't scare

413
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,970
you too much but if you have five
minutes to be roaming around thank you

414
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,299
very much
