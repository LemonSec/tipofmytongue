1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,309
this is the network security monitoring
validation session my name is Scott pack

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,649
so several times through this I'm going
to reference and acronym which is

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,449
completely made up called right though
which is the rock your socks off so the

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,949
goal behind this project when I'm going
to be talking about is basically to do

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,760
everything you can to increase the
amount of data that you're sending to

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,740
your security operations center to
completely inundate them with every

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,329
piece of information they would everyone
so when I used to write this was talking

8
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:41,309
about this product- warm that so little
about myself my name is Scott pack my

9
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,339
alias portal user you have to scroll
down a long ways on a hacker challenged

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,120
find that a bit of a pinewood derby
mechanic I enjoy over engineering derby

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,169
cars with jet engines and brushless
motors and Argentinos and whatever I can

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,609
stick it in security engineer at Adobe
which lets me work on a lot of fun

13
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,260
projects that scale which kind of leads
into the next one since we work on a lot

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,340
of things that are very large scale I
try to automate as much as I can

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,520
partly because I liked you meeting stuff
and partially because I'm just very lazy

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,509
so little bit of a disclaimer about the
data that we're gonna be seen here it

17
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,220
was all generated an elaborate fake data
so it's not actually indicative of our

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,560
environment and I came out of an
academia environment so I did some

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,229
research with BYU and academia and you
have something that you want to talk

20
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,579
about but you don't actually want to
give people code for it or show them how

21
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:44,929
you did it you call this framework so
this is kind of a chunk of the details

22
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,040
have been stripped out but if you're
interested about how it was implemented

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,399
a little bit more behind the scenes or
if you wanna get some code to get

24
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,850
yourself started on this come talk to me
afterwards now I can help you get

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,429
started so a little bit of context
around us

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,050
network security monitoring so in your
investigations are when you're trying to

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,530
find badness that attackers are doing
you're gonna want as much data as you

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,410
can but you never know what kind of data
is going to be security relevant in an

29
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,950
investigation prior to heart we'd most
people were probably not thinking I

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,190
should probably be capturing all of my
SL negotiation renegotiation and

31
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,120
heartbeat packets like us know
somebody's anything some not something

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,200
anyone was doing so you want a second as
much as you can and post information is

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,299
a great I'm a huge fan of host OS logs
application logs their invaluable and I

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,510
think pretty much any security
investigation if you're locking those

35
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:53,310
you're blind but network security
monitoring comes in really useful

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,610
because it cannot lie you can be obvious
stated it can be encrypted but if an

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,760
attacker is doing something on hosts in
your network it has to go through your

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,910
internet connection is something that's
in your control and you can put it

39
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,780
security monitoring controls in line
with battery or on the side of it to try

40
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,180
and catch that madness on its way in or
data exfiltration on so there are

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,380
several different years of network
security monitoring of the weakest one

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,239
is firewall logs this source IP tried
hitting the sport and it was walked or

43
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,709
hit tried hitting the sport and it was
gonna give you a whole lot it'll help

44
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,970
you find things like like port scans but
if you only had no idea what they were

45
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,549
actually doing or is it was successful

46
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:50,180
gonna get you very far the next up is
going to be next targets what generates

47
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,670
it's basically a record of a network
session that happened this endpoint

48
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,119
activist and point it lasted about this
long is about this happened over these

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,709
ports it's good stuff but it's not going
to tell you exactly what they did I'll

50
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,600
tell you what they say

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,649
but you're not going to be able to see
what it looked like most good time so

52
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,140
the next step which most people think of
when they think of network security

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,630
monitoring user intrusion detection
system intrusion prevention system it's

54
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,630
alright but the problem with most yes
night yes is that they don't give you

55
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,030
all the context around what's going on
so they might trigger on some of sending

56
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,909
packet now grab that packet and stories
for you but you most ideas and iPS cells

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,720
aren't going to capture also the
response to that or they're not going to

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,520
capture what happened before that or
after that so you might be able to see

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
something that triggered the signature
but you might not be able to see the

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
result of what happened there

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,380
the next step up as transaction
monitoring this is kind of a there's a

62
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,880
couple pools it'll do this bro is a
pretty common one of the prequel one

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,640
basically extracts protocol data from
your conversations so instead of saying

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,360
well there is an SSL conversation that
happened here

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
network transaction monitoring will be
able to pull out of this is the

66
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,470
certificate was presented and and give
you a little bit more information around

67
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,460
around what happened on the line also
it's very very large so transaction

68
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,810
monitoring your not usually just looking
for signatures you're pulling everything

69
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,370
that happens which means that every
network communication that happens is

70
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,920
going to result in several lines analog
somewhere really useful and good to have

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,060
but they'll take up a lot of disk space
and then if you're willing to put down

72
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,320
the GDP of germany you can buy whole
packet capture solution drop it in place

73
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,349
and store your data for like three days
it's expensive but it's hard to beat

74
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,390
that level of detail

75
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,219
ok so if you look at your like your
network security monitoring 101 you're

76
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,640
going to see a diagram that looks a lot
like this like okay you have your

77
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,099
internet point over here you have your
couple of desktops are your server over

78
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,210
here just checking IDs in the middle and
then you're good as anybody have a

79
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,469
network that actually looks like that is
responsible for network one desktop one

80
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,620
server one laptop connected to a switch
home I'd be surprised more people in

81
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,240
here even have a setup at home but I
think most of us are trying to work with

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,560
networks the look more like the tokyo
subways

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,180
you have office read your garlic remote
offices branch offices you might have

84
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,220
some business partners are subsidiaries
you might have people that have done

85
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,720
like cloudburst eating and are an Amazon
or like you might have network

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,090
connectivity all over the place it's
hard to keep track of where traffic is

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,150
coming in how it's getting around where
it's going out and have a massive amount

88
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,200
of respect for network engineers and
architects that get this setup and

89
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,630
actually running but when it comes down
to it in the business is pushing on them

90
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,210
to expand capacity here there or to take
care of some kind of break six outage

91
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,430
causing an ideal bility problem

92
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,560
kinda last thing on their minds when
they set up the new thing to make it

93
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,210
work is to tell security hey we change
this thing you need to move your tap

94
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,810
senior spends around to make sure that
you're still seeing your chaotic right

95
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,840
they just it's not the top on their
priorities are priorities make it work

96
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:50,169
and then we'll let security figured out
later so beyond the network complexity

97
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,560
there's also a bunch of other things
that could cause you to be blind or

98
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,430
traffic you'll have your ideas and it'll
be looking here traffic usually through

99
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,180
a tapper a spanner in line that might be
sending this traffic to a traffic

100
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,450
aggregator like to give him on her iPod
or something else and then that in turn

101
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,099
is configured to feed that off to one or
more

102
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,550
of these different monitoring tools well
if there's anything wrong with the

103
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,810
topper spanner the network configuration
you're not gonna see if there's anything

104
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,110
wrong with the app Connor the gigamon
configuration you're not gonna see it if

105
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,030
you're right if your ideas your NSM is
oversubscribed could be dropped dropping

106
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,609
traffic on Interstate if there's some
issue with supporting those events to

107
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,460
your your alert aggregation or your your
sim kind of product you're not gonna be

108
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,550
seeing those aren't so there's all kinds
of places where this information chain

109
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:47,060
can start to break down so there's two
approaches to figuring out if you're

110
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,160
seeing everything you want to be seeing
if you're from you a background having

111
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,620
to experience there's a number of
different kinds of tests you can run on

112
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,310
software there's like your smoke testing
your unit testing unit testing is

113
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,770
awesome because it's very very specific
you can look for a very well honed in on

114
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,620
things pieces of functionality but
problem here is that there are so many

115
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,000
different pieces of functionality in
that chain that's hard to predict

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,450
everything that could go wrong

117
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,120
beyond that it's going to involve a lot
of different people you're gonna need

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,000
people for network engineering team your
your datacenter operations team your

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,140
system administration team your security
engineering team all of these different

120
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,290
groups to check their little component
of this process and make sure that is

121
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,079
working so as I said before I'm lazy and
i dont wanna write all of these

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,640
individual case to look at every manual
key component of pipeline instead of

123
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,840
pulling up the car and looking under it
and checking the alternator in the

124
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,520
transmission and everything inside of
this part I'm just gonna turn the key

125
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,050
I'm gonna do something that should have
an expected output just one that has

126
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,920
higher thing and see if it comes out
right so one way you can do that is just

127
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,550
to send like normal malicious traffic in
and out of your network and then see if

128
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,699
your security operations team freaks out
about it every night operations team

129
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,320
there are you digging through tons of
false positives as it is do we have any

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,250
any security operations people in here
like who's we have people looking at

131
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,240
network security monitoring events got
couple hands so I think you're probably

132
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,940
feeling the pain of false positives I
think pretty much any organization works

133
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,350
at more false positives than true
positives so I didn't want to cause any

134
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,300
more work for them that I had to so
instead of abusing an existing signature

135
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,410
in the sauna Sam stacks I wrote with
work with other people who wrote write a

136
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,149
handful of signatures that we're just
looking for something benign in this one

137
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,560
it's just looking for HTTP traffic
containing the string it somewhere safe

138
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,130
on right though so it's a good idea to
make that a lot more random I usually

139
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,630
use like a 32 character random string
some of some files that I have also done

140
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,029
but as long as that stays the same
across all your requests and every

141
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,360
request every synthetic transaction
meaning every like they can attack that

142
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,050
you're sending in how's that then you
would expect the jury your NSM

143
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,990
controlled catches fire alert so beyond
that you have another identifier in

144
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:41,100
beyond the rise OID you see this token
equals so that coca needs to be randomly

145
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,510
generated for each request that you send
ideas and I'll come into play a little

146
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,899
bit more later helped to uniquely
identify these alright so I chose HTTP

147
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:58,370
here kind of arbitrarily mostly because
most NSM controls are pretty flexible

148
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,260
and letting you create signatures for
ages but really you could write it for

149
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,089
any probe

150
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:10,899
I'd like to branch out and start cutting
additional protocols as HTTP EZ it's

151
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,360
it's a good point of units probably the
main used this from most of these

152
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,600
situations but it'll be good to get a
better a little bit more Brett there so

153
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,980
this is a circuit court rule I think we
have like five or six different

154
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,509
signatures for different and assembling
roles but they pretty much all have some

155
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:36,990
way of saying hey if it's this protocol
and contains the string parlor the nice

156
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,740
thing about this is you don't care
what's in the middle

157
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,329
you have some hosts on your inside the
inside of your network and some hosts on

158
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,998
the outside of your network and you're
just firing that across and you're gonna

159
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:55,689
see if one of your NSM controls picks it
up anywhere so it's it's very ignorant

160
00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:02,620
of what your network looks like it's
just send it out so it's an example of

161
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,089
190 s alert will look like this is in
JSON format so it has the alert action

162
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,879
allows or permitted to flow the
signature rise alert the category and

163
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,550
then the printable payload and it's
important here to get the printable

164
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:26,758
payload out so if you're running a sim
like like dark siders or whatever you

165
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,249
were pulling it all together and this is
what your security operations of folks

166
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:37,259
are analysts are looking at so great we
sent out a request and we got an alert

167
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,850
when combined together and we know that
at least this one place that we tested

168
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,259
is looking good one that's not really
enough cuz we have lots and lots of

169
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,819
different network segments lots of
location and lots of boundaries that we

170
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,509
wanted to test so needed to find a good
way of distributing these requests

171
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:00,269
across the entire entire environment
with any salt users folks in the in the

172
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:06,379
room no salt ok so suspect is a
configuration management tool it's

173
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:12,970
written in Python it's built and
maintained by a group down in

174
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,740
Lehigh salts that it's pretty similar to
a smaller configuration management types

175
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,160
of tools cool things about it is it's
very extensible and you can write

176
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,969
execution modules meaning I can write a
chunk of Python and put it on the salt

177
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,360
master it will distribute it to all the
hosts that responsible for controlling

178
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,949
and then I can call that executed module
that will make them do whatever I want

179
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:46,410
so this is a little active bit of a salt
execution model you'll see it's taking

180
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,160
the IP address a target IP to service
this case he and then the right idea

181
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,829
which would be the same fundraiser
string it generates a token and then it

182
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,399
just opens that up and returns the
response code and that's pretty much all

183
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:09,089
of that box need to do in order to run
this tests and that you set it up as a

184
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,529
crontab or everyone's schedule it on
your boxes to make sure that these fires

185
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,309
every hour 20 minutes four hours
whatever whatever period you want to do

186
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:24,699
your testing on so here I have it
running 20 requests for years like every

187
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,579
half hour or so

188
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:32,508
schedule on it to every million that's a
member of this cluster studies minions

189
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:38,790
span multiple network segments and
traverses many boundaries as you can so

190
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,599
you have some kind of administration
network in all of your different sites

191
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,360
and that'd be a good a good candidate to
run these tests from the logs that it

192
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,730
creates the riser side that salt runner
is generates the time it was run the

193
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,290
target the IP response code the token
and the host sent out the sent out a

194
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,189
request the ideas on the other side
selects which hosts got it so you'll be

195
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:14,199
like ideas one-dot wherever your domain
and it'll also pull out the printable

196
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:23,469
payload containing the triggering string
here saying and the request to riser

197
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,470
token that random identifier so next
year you're probably already already

198
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,900
guessed it all together so you need to
take the inputs from your rise Olog take

199
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,890
that combine it with the results of your
ideas event and sticking together to see

200
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:45,340
what you found in what you did it you
could probably write a database to do

201
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,940
this I just use what we are you had my
views are used Splunk sure that's which

202
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,820
resulted in a pretty ugly Querrey or
celiac 67 lines of inquiry language at

203
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,750
the bottom but it was pretty well and
it's very portable to other two other

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,579
anise and control so if you write a
signature for another NSM control you

205
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,359
just change like three words three
little pieces of risk and then you can

206
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,240
monitor that entire control as well so
it makes it very easy to switch from one

207
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,550
control to another but it does have the
depends if using using Splunk is your

208
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:29,080
cell so if you're lucky you'll run this
report and you'll come out with

209
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,990
something that looks like this like the
lowest rate here 94% most of the sites

210
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,240
400% like us pretty dang good I'll take
it

211
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,790
most folks I don't think we have too
much of a problem which sampling at 94%

212
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:49,050
and a couple of their locations like
sure you could you could see working to

213
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,050
that try and bring it up to a hundred
percent but knowing that you're catching

214
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:59,960
94 95 is pretty reassuring ok another
thing that's interesting here is that

215
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,300
usually if you have anything coming out
of sight it's a pretty good bet that

216
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,080
your network is setup right it's
probably just a problem with some

217
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,020
interface being oversubscribed so that
already will start point you in the

218
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,480
direction what problems you might be
running into so it's also possible that

219
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,330
you're gonna have something that looks
more like this that everything is broken

220
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,928
you can't see crap but on the upside no
passcode is here

221
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:33,820
so some zeros meaning there's some more
substantial set up something is wrong

222
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,399
you're not getting the traffic at all
and some sites some lower lower

223
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:45,279
percentage capturing which could be any
number of things so it if you start

224
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,369
running this year under this kind of
problem you end up having to go back and

225
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,999
do that whole check every piece of the
chain approach you're bringing in your

226
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,909
network engineers and you're bringing in
your data center operations to see if

227
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:03,029
somebody has been unpacking things in
your business owner or somebody's been

228
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:09,450
changing lines around what's been going
on so it doesn't solve all your problems

229
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,139
and it doesn't tell you exactly what the
problem is but it will give you a good

230
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:18,639
idea of where to start looking so if
you're archiving these for any amount of

231
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:25,008
time you can also answer questions like
during an investigation of seven days

232
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:30,700
ago we're leavin capturing traffic on
that site or were even looking at that

233
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,809
kind of data but give it will help you
know how with what amount of confidence

234
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,360
you can say that something did not which
is a scary question it's hard to say

235
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,059
it's carried asked if this happened when
I have even seen it but it's still

236
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:52,110
probably something you should be asking
yourself and your organization so that's

237
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,529
mostly interrupted up there's there's
something that I still like to do with

238
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,509
this there's tracking and Justin delay
so the amount of time that elapses

239
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:06,139
between a bad request coming in or out
and when that actually would appear in

240
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,168
front of the nationalist I think would
be interesting information to look at

241
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:15,889
their some hiccups with ingress
validation specifically around anything

242
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:22,158
that proxy to request could modify tired
or drop your your synthetic transactions

243
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,190
before they get to where you're right
you're NSM controls would pick them up

244
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,580
as I said before I'd like to branch out
and start testing things other than HTTP

245
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,399
and HTTPS I think most of the time just
checking http would probably be

246
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,540
sufficient

247
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,190
it hits your ideas your ideas working
out it probably going to catch other

248
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,210
protocols as well but for the sake of
being completed like to bring

249
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,080
branched out more also right now there
is a ton of special dependencies like

250
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,750
you have to be using like I mentioned
salt I mentions I mentioned a couple

251
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,360
other things and right now it's very
specific to running that stock

252
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,560
technologies I'd like to find a way of
making it a little more a little more

253
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,480
portable and a little bit more
technology agnostic kind of goes on to

254
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,650
the next one additional controls for so
as I said right now I'm supporting like

255
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,760
five or six different and the same
controls and it's not a ton of work to

256
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,210
do you add additional controls about
getting more bread would make it so that

257
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:31,180
more people can use it to get the goal
is to make get all of these indicators

258
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,810
that you may not be seeing and send them
here sector your your your security

259
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,560
operations team kind of like I make them
drown and false positives but given the

260
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,429
that their give them the assurance that
they're seeing all the data in all the

261
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,490
traffic but they don't anticipate so
that when they say no this has not

262
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:54,280
happened you have a pretty mount a
pretty good amount of a surety that

263
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,970
actually happened to any questions I can
answer about about the system about what

264
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:10,510
the goals are about what controls went
into it and questions I can answer okay

265
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,420
so as a side note we are looking at
Adobe we're looking for a position on

266
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,830
our security operations team so if you
like digging into lots of food aid are

267
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,560
using people come talk to me afterwards
and yes thank you
