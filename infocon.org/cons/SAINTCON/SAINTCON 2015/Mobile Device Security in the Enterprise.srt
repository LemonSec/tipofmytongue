1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,240
mobile device security enterprise
security impact our operations are

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,550
simply stated that we're trying to
protect what is the impact resources are

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,750
we trying to keep from unauthorized
access so the first thing on the cover

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:30,029
is that makes me so we discussing the
stock are going to be able to reach you

5
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,260
can be used for good and bad rate so
that it is important to have that in the

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,780
back of our minds we work this and
treatments information accordingly and

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,429
that way

8
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:50,319
warned that way Jesus recent report
unauthorized access you can convert some

9
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:57,199
consequences but is not a little bit
about me quite some time but steers

10
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,280
security runners will consultancy firm
called security dude but its recent

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,530
testing of security work and local
network enterprise support 3d instructor

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:20,540
for sands heard of census suit and so
great resource for learning content

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:30,530
I also run local wats up to here in LA a
lot of remote a security project OWASP

14
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:40,180
deal on a working web browser security
costs agree great resource for regular

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:48,170
monthly meetings organized by a group
called you might want to consider adding

16
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,150
some of the meeting slow so that just a
little bit about me now as far as the

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:06,460
audience here who is responsible for
security in their number Harry Potter

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:19,980
and general user oh wow gold and other
groups so customize it

19
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:29,510
the presentation to the different groups
here and is the reason for this

20
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,260
restock contact

21
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:43,399
about devices are in regions where his
heart lies and impact they have on the

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,420
corporate controls and what kind of
impact they have on the information that

23
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,899
is being sent to them about why so
serious threats to Woodstock movie about

24
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,840
why this is why it's a concern should be
spending on time resources and this time

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,049
the resources to make sure that that now
we find a risk and personalize it and

26
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,269
determine if this were a while something
about it that you have any kind of

27
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,970
racist impact that that is worthwhile
turns 82 exchanges waited we are a break

28
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,540
I'll talk about to use ActiveSync
reduced from a lot of his rehabilitation

29
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,720
Patricia find that act is saved his most
common rated corporate about prices are

30
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,440
for you I didn't realize access see your
email infrastructure to get that's just

31
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,859
talking about the MGM about device
management solutions what kind of role

32
00:03:50,859 --> 00:04:03,410
they play and I guess things and we'll
talk about the main platforms are

33
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:11,250
reviewing Richard a long while since I S
Android gonna compared to 23 told that

34
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,548
companies can use to the phone line
whose bed have a social engineering

35
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:26,469
country sometimes with exercises today
by the users are treating the attacks

36
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,920
are coming in to their through their
mobile devices and we'll talk a bit

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,830
about compromise of Zelda

38
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:45,570
so some of their recent some of the tax
collectors for jailed or jailbroken

39
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,390
iPhone so this is not going to jail
broken iPhone still difficult for many

40
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:57,650
years from from member of her and then
we'll talk about you know some of the

41
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:06,280
world security issues that we see as we
allow devices connect to wi-fi networks

42
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:16,919
like them you know the gods are smiling
upon this level i download to

43
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,080
demonstrate how this reconvene and then
we'll kind of wrap up a little bit of

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,469
pears and how they stack up

45
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:38,040
examples and agendas as we recovered but
first things first in the enterprise was

46
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,320
way over about two ice cream treat
yourself enterprise it's for you were

47
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,310
able to access email is all hearsay
productivity benefits to decide that you

48
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,000
can have your users the reachable via
email

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,620
they have a form that's something that
people could be could be quiet extended

50
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:09,280
number of our site to save time and it's
challenging but not impossible

51
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,109
my experience to keep fewer critical
corporate data out of the email as most

52
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:22,669
common way that we can meet later this
week and we can reach a scary and export

53
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:30,450
controls in place to prevent sensitive
data and David it should be treated

54
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,039
accordingly

55
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,370
out of email but the chances are that
you might lead so that's why when we

56
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,690
consider gmail considered critical
functions within the organization and

57
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,160
critical functions from the recent one
as well because of the day today that

58
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,180
he's going to fade is going that

59
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,830
the email now shifts to receive the way
that these leaders access you'll notice

60
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:13,659
your diagram from these data can so that
60% of all email USL on smartphones and

61
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,250
tablets I said number is growing so
that's that's that's why we're thinking

62
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,229
about the date it is going to email
reach even be considered as a killer the

63
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:30,280
deal is done from the mobile devices and
what kind of controls about devices have

64
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,409
achieved for enterprise access to the
data as you can see the only 34 percent

65
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:43,039
according to the study it's the news on
desktops and that number is growing so

66
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,150
this is kind of the reason the reason
why you want to look into it and put it

67
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:56,979
on your gender czarist the research
organizations facing majority of the

68
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:03,520
environment said come across this system
works our customers are using it to see

69
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:19,270
you here is not easy

70
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:27,150
ok but the underlying and lying to
communicate with its e-service selective

71
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,350
screening ok I see customers some of
their other technology so that other

72
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:43,000
providers but do you guys use decades
since the couple things you need to be

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,670
aware about ActiveSync it uses to
synchronize

74
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,530
email calendar contacts tasks

75
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,180
what about the communication between the
mobile devices and Exchange Server

76
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,650
housing three cases protected by a semi
have any thoughts on that house

77
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:12,160
indicates in to YouTube mobile device
and write down that river itself is

78
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,699
protecting their particular reason and
limitations of SSL TLS is obviously one

79
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,680
and only protects data transit right so
that only protects aid as it travels

80
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,189
between one and point to another virus
protection on the endpoints what kind of

81
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,279
protection is a cellulose offers

82
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:48,060
transport layer security and that only
the exterior of the transfer you now

83
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,180
have their ways around that protects
somebody says he'll ask his cell is that

84
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,859
prevent somebody from getting the
Realtek case not necessarily write

85
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,899
briefs and obviously we have controls in
place we have three components of GLSL

86
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,999
better providing that integrity
confidentiality and I think the city

87
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:19,819
right but with a lack of something
called sickening feeling a little bit so

88
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:26,809
with a second-inning you're actually
considering your application to only

89
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:35,569
communicate with the backend server
using the certificate that is presented

90
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:42,930
and that is typically you should be good
by the internal CIA or your third party

91
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,989
to purchase but it's not just gonna use
any certificate from the trust or should

92
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,309
I use that particular strip it of its
you hard coded identification code into

93
00:10:52,309 --> 00:11:01,779
your scientific important cases they say
that in service now cover little bit

94
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:09,850
about a last minute but this is Ellen
klas fuller come through

95
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:20,170
don't tell us your router right so what
was the most current version of I guess

96
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:29,009
right so we want to use the latest and
greatest because said this is underlying

97
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:35,620
fundamental control for a lot of
communications for you know a lot about

98
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,949
jury on the web on line here is gonna be
incurred upon this concept of transit

99
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,019
Private Securities so that's under a lot
of scrutiny since console you know the

100
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:54,420
lies you should be uncovered so earlier
versions obviously didn't quite set out

101
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,990
this way to be replaced by a terribly
versions to sell get the name was in a

102
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:11,389
second there some some copyrightc chill
out the new version and the new standard

103
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:17,560
all right hand signs that I think how
does it indicate that users without see

104
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,670
less without that transport layer
security how does it does it protect

105
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,540
music password

106
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:35,230
resubmit it was that its own a slight
easing basically any case how is based

107
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,000
in many cases protect their credentials
on the web for a long time itself one of

108
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,440
their cases methods that can be used to
indicate client server and using a

109
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:57,850
password is not something that I know of
I'm coatings guineas basic coding right

110
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,040
is that very difficult to decode now
very simple to decode so sometime you

111
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,709
keep in mind that ActiveSync 2012 still
using basic authentication for

112
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:17,440
protection now that's a lesson cells on
top of that transit line on the client

113
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,070
side to get into middle that he'll ask
subjugation which is possible to get me

114
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,530
know that till I cell phone case and
then you can actually see pencils

115
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:32,949
assorted color do you go to meet so how
do we saw this as soon as we have mobile

116
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:40,580
device management is an obvious
candidate you were having some kind of

117
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:49,930
control and lower prices are those might
be some of the ideas that have an MDM

118
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:56,370
solution and I mean concept behind MGM
is that ability to manage devices like

119
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,960
without influence of desktops
workstations reason why

120
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,320
what we're used to manage configuration
on sonar and four hits in enterprise

121
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,960
Active Directory so he's active
directory to manage devices and points

122
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,840
on upper environments and GMAC is its
component that is trying to achieve that

123
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,090
same capability for them about the nice
and you know you can remotely for

124
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,260
security settings and configure device
according to these incredible

125
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:39,350
consistency control becomes an
unrestricted target as well right

126
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:58,529
many years of abuse from p.m.
registration process

127
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:05,639
we would hear similar products say that
possibility capability but it also

128
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,939
brings with it a private so the users
right because it has quite a bit of

129
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:17,849
capability into mobile device that's it
could be your own device and that these

130
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:24,759
uses of where we can reach me she gives
here and there are some private data so

131
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,709
we can see perhaps even stole my phone
is a recent privacy the fact that you

132
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:40,899
could conceive applications you so you
know it's kinda area of focus and

133
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,720
concentration is concerned also what
you'll find is you know how do you know

134
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,329
that your rates in with a correct and
you have a solution right that's process

135
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,319
what time does not quite as a result of
that process of becoming abuse and then

136
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:02,420
we'll talk about how for example in iOS
environment they can create profiles are

137
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:09,529
used by MGM solutions can be used to for
malicious purposes while discussing

138
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:14,860
various artists you know the most common
two-month some of that forms a deal with

139
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:23,589
iOS Android apps or resuming play race
riots in some studies about you know

140
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,550
which one has malware on

141
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:34,319
on the platform train doesn't offend you
know sconce after getting nowhere on

142
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:43,010
this platform and see how sexy and
really important concept that the whole

143
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:52,360
idea is that for Android devices if you
know what platform offers the

144
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,519
responsibility of that that you can take
advantage of the same time the way today

145
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:05,579
about the cases are handled by the
platform the whole you know any tax sure

146
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:15,800
and in all groups a place to lure
relationship opens it up to talk to your

147
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,959
cell attack vectors

148
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:25,439
moving target areas without the worry
that sure there is a certain apps alert

149
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:33,940
different different benefits alright so
let's talk about so this is strictly a

150
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,400
year I wanted to kind of automated
process of trying to do so since nearing

151
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:50,580
miami is a very good pattern on a
website that uses Google Voice ABI to

152
00:17:50,580 --> 00:18:00,668
send out text messages here you see how
they handle the snow profiles on there I

153
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:01,130
saw

154
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:08,440
they install applications on their on
their Android devices so you can have a

155
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,060
solution of your email address your
corporate environment you can you said

156
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:21,470
as targets and send out text messages
and see how they have even though it

157
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,470
isn't I'm alright this is a command-line
interface intervening in that run a

158
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,720
little bit more about it so it's just a
demonstration hero compromising in a

159
00:18:34,720 --> 00:19:18,890
Jewish boy yelled at him

160
00:19:18,890 --> 00:20:02,610
so here we have consideration MDM
solution you can kind of see well

161
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:21,620
better than expected this is anybody
used p.m. iPhone Configuration Manager

162
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,659
ok so sorry to all that you can get them
out but what it does is you can

163
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:37,650
configure you can configure your phone
or mobile device these days what we're

164
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,549
doing is we're considering the WiFi
networks that connect with that

165
00:20:44,549 --> 00:21:04,050
consideration profound and then we are
sending out there sending out email

166
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:14,090
so you can use to create a profile what
are you doing here so it's kinda weird

167
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,480
on the same but we can figuring WiFi
network received for his concentration

168
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,060
profiles one and then the sound of his
soldiers from the automatic reconnect to

169
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:31,409
the wireless network are you can put a
passcode on there you can put

170
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,010
certificates bracelet it does it's in
somebody's those who filed the mobile

171
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,390
device that will put us to the trust or
on a device which means any

172
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,700
communication from that from that access
point will be trusted by the important

173
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,320
so we can figure that for a while and
then he's in this semester tool we're

174
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,110
gonna send out contributed linked to the
candidates from outside target users say

175
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:07,290
we have a target of victims and we gonna
provide a email it to do the meaning of

176
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,740
words that can produce a proposed being
stored then we put in our concern Greece

177
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,370
and power and I'm so sorry to bother
gmail so that can use voice that sounds

178
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,040
an SMS the target and here's the target
on the right hand side you can see the

179
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,290
screen and it targets a text message
text messages says this price no

180
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,320
complaints of a corporate policy to
prevent remote tribal this device is so

181
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,750
his problem I'll write down your users
would have good time at least

182
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:44,190
to do as a device gonna be wife because
you know that's not to say here we

183
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,050
installing a profile and tells you you
gonna have a certificate to you or to

184
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:56,040
trust or difficulties by for Twitter
which is one of the tools they use for

185
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,860
British investing and it tells you it
also makes your desire to be

186
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,709
reconfigured to connect the wireless
access for someone stole a device and

187
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,900
yes yes those now we gonna use out
device to connect to send an email like

188
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:33,610
Sony's case to send an email and send it
to me

189
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:45,419
proxy

190
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:57,880
your Exchange server I think that's
going back and forth and then when you

191
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:31,770
see

192
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:39,830
so we can see the users you could
message so he's obviously trusting that

193
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,860
could be cases be secure turns out the
email and he knows intercepted here we

194
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:54,169
can't go there to see that secret
message right in the middle that

195
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,070
communication because the using solar
profile that contain the certificate

196
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,889
issued by Burke sweet and now perhaps we
can see that communication is set of

197
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:11,360
that message when we gonna do we gonna
season message to announce here to

198
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,419
message comes into the users saying I'm
firing everyone company so it's just

199
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,040
demonstrated using solar cancer research
profile would be significant that was

200
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:29,670
configured with no is configured by
sleep and that's significant allowed but

201
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,050
sweet which could be a third party
somewhere near net somebody that manage

202
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:41,100
that access point that communications
going through a few that Jill SSL

203
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,300
certificate to kill SSL traffic as they
say that China going to make some money

204
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,470
to fight and then change the message
that tells me know if you should do that

205
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:58,400
we gonna look at using password is basic
recoded anything you

206
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,370
it take you back to the burbs when you
look at it it's raining out here is some

207
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:14,110
password password again sorry for better
solution only two but on my lap top

208
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:24,610
executives just rejected any questions
about that process that slow attack a

209
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:31,449
sense ok so let's see what some of it
could take away from that

210
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:41,080
directors is awareness actually having
users not being able to go

211
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:53,269
profiles that are not much just gonna
lock that down to the second your eye

212
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,460
and a medium solutions suid-afrika
ability to prevent users from selling

213
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,380
you know self-signed certificates for
example so that there'd be some area

214
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,200
that you can achieve control but it's
it's definitely a big concern right now

215
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,669
is just around right now it's just a
living from email to actually connecting

216
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:23,549
to wifi right so most of it is a super
deal with the release they have a

217
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:33,730
career-high five and which companies
will does not have a bright line

218
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,250
devices laptops to connect to the
corporate environment without impacting

219
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,230
the liar

220
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,960
so WPA enterprise is the most common
commitment to do we not being done now

221
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,490
this component WPA enterprise right
himself again which is about the right

222
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,910
so we have an indicator

223
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:58,150
access when you have a RADIUS server
which actually what does a great subject

224
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,820
to their three and one of them that's
where you'll find that in many cases the

225
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:12,290
wireless network will be the same as
your as Europe Active Directory 0-3 to

226
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:20,678
get a taxi but we see people which
doesn't offer that kill us and the

227
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:27,340
mississippi to you know I think that we
should be to have spent so much scrutiny

228
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:35,409
on that on that circle and the method of
indications and I definitely covered

229
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,740
that it's very easily breakable right so
that says we're going to demonstrate how

230
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,770
damaged a right now some of the issues

231
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:53,370
what they set up we have number one its
failure to properly authenticate any

232
00:28:53,370 --> 00:29:01,419
cases that wasn't the case in serving
the state's very slight radius ok so

233
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,200
maybe concern here is that bad

234
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:14,440
your clients may be tricked into
connecting to access crimes that are

235
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:23,390
there actually not so somebody else is
up next when the looks just like you

236
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:29,390
explain with with exceptional research
because the match but what you'll find

237
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:36,860
is users really really hard to tell
whether it's difficult he is signed by

238
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,889
their tracks authority unless you have
some great new way of the computer

239
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:53,990
devices those devices are som and as a
result side effect of that is because

240
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,060
sir you're make Access Point Road will
gather the credentials that ass and by

241
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,980
that you know victim treat crime

242
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,330
and if you haven't already set up and
you know you iOS device to device will

243
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:17,418
automatically provide us financials and
automatically provide that he said

244
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,840
bothered to texas florida is it is set
up so that's obviously something shiny

245
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,260
shoes as far as how this is considered
how was he set up and kind of learning

246
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,879
from the browser is right we are
providing a lot of information to the

247
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:41,410
browser's Help down recognize the web
server we try to not says he's not is

248
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:48,200
not probably been sucking a bit about
that from the client's standpoint what

249
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,860
are some of their

250
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:57,799
tax is a browser cache on short lets you
connect to shell out so you know

251
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:03,480
Research Institute website so first
person who loves ya communism's ago

252
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,630
everyone check is issued by a trusted CA
is if you get so worried that some

253
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:20,299
addresses story of the browser and it's
a good side by side so as long as that

254
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,929
stresses secret story and the browser
one complaint as always is issued by

255
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:33,120
entity I'm thinking this is a democratic
eighty so that would be a common name

256
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,199
for your rights here it is certainly
have a common name and or your website

257
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,620
will have a common name like auxo have
company and then trying to access a web

258
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:54,149
server will check to see if the common
name of that house at server response of

259
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,580
Max is a common name of sid says there's
a mismatch you might get companies that

260
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,530
match is expired

261
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:08,030
obviously this is only a certain amount
of time and firewood complaining about

262
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,850
scenario editor

263
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:18,168
the correct type is it well I've got
some cases SMTP to the diverse to match

264
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,940
and as it could be improved motorboats

265
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,880
cases now this is shocked to see how
that's handled that's another area of

266
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,230
concern the slow how how long does it
take store for a significant to be

267
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:43,289
identified to be communicated to all you
know and everybody is aware that it's

268
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:48,720
not an area of concern so how do we have
it configured on our wireless LAN

269
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,450
settings this is an example of it
desktop laptop configuration settings I

270
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,260
mean anybody seen the second be
considered a 6-2 in this Sun top there

271
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,090
we have it first set box says state
security service significant right so

272
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,389
it's checked out election second ago
they said that some checked wow that's a

273
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:16,850
check what happens to be the case in the
junior Ryan O'Neal laptop and your

274
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:23,730
RADIUS server thats dedicating users
that are trying to connect what happens

275
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:35,149
if you don't check that

276
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:42,279
traffic in transit will be protected
when you see that jealous channel you

277
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:48,179
have no insurance no guarantee that you
talking to the right to serve a good

278
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:53,639
Europa syndication service that's what
is integrating attack the next two

279
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,339
servers and second check box there to
Khamenei's a year and is serving as we

280
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:05,489
want to put you on that subject to check
for and then at least next Aliso here

281
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:16,720
early so here it goes it's a good
stories think is your list of 26 36

282
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,158
electronic things they will tell us
African to check to make sure that this

283
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,480
issue has been assigned one of those
guys that is distressing and then you

284
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,110
don't from the user to authorize to
override those settings

285
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,750
and it's obviously here we have a
machete to that is coming we gonna give

286
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,980
you any more dignity privacy

287
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,110
choosing to go clear text anybody that's
the thing wireless network to get the

288
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:52,550
username you something to your wireless
network thing you want from 1 April that

289

otherwise use your name or demanding
he's able to protect

290
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,840
now here's the same setting for your
iPhone Configuration Utility this is

291
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,400
where you set up even set up to have you
know your wireless network you want to

292
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,890
connect to their society you want to set
up you know security type and this is

293
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,910
where you put your certificate chances
are good that you want to you know kind

294
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,799
of car towed into that category since
profile and the common name of your

295
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,340
RADIUS server going here so here's kind
of comparison between you know your

296
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,440
endpoints laptops and desktops unsecured
probably for the wireless WPA enterprise

297
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:44,470
registrations and here's a sample of
Iowa wireless time said now is do a

298
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:50,660
quick I left them on your iOS device
configuration profiles decide which

299
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,690
showed in the previous damn aware was a
text message

300
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:04,440
downloaded and it's also a website for
participating on computer already kinda

301
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:21,310
that part of the scene

302
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:36,400
every day and it's serving cake access
warned that sounds ready

303
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,540
doing this that would be considered for
your your

304
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:50,300
operators Wireless store name and I'm
gonna kick it off if you want to look at

305
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:58,550
the wifi section here you'll see a
corporate WirelessHD that is very

306
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:07,930
separate dressing ok now I didn't do
anything I just pulled up my without my

307
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:13,589
phone and because I have my phone
considered to connect to go towards

308
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:21,170
Wireless I didn't set any kind of
configuration settings on the on this to

309
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,720
say that only use the certificates right
I downloaded the files you can download

310
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,649
it on as well from the Euro its WWF
security and dot com slash TW former

311
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,200
wife I dot about the site downloaded
that could increase from how does the

312
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:46,270
time go through all that downloaded to
my phone has surveyed say I just like me

313
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,020
and your corporate users to be going in
the same how do i connect a while and

314
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,220
see that it's covered Wireless is a
society we use glad I saw the profile of

315
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,759
the great lakes except Italy settings

316
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:09,310
now because it's difficult to have one
here is a jacket that I created for this

317
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:14,799
exercise price online medical semi
productive so these days it's a good

318
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:23,730
look here and it makes me do with it

319
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:32,619
MSFT to write so I had to consider to
communicate the words so help me too and

320
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:39,450
now like I said you saw men in tights
anything I just automatically provide

321
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:44,899
examine password forgot to go to my
phone and then now the bad guy has a

322
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,950
password for me so I did anything bad
happening right now in the bad guys do

323
00:38:49,950 --> 00:39:01,049
that yourself don't take this so we
actually OCD you can also provides you

324
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:13,359
joanne has right rear as username and
password and the password is actually so

325
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:24,990
how do you crack into John the Ripper
right so every kind of setup so years

326
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:33,660
generator in my box here so I'm going
around undercover agents that whatever

327
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:45,950
might steve is that took this

328
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:57,589
to text file my laptop in Iran against a
weird place right now in your

329
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:04,500
environment with your case I started
quickly so it is correct it right away

330
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:13,710
by stories welcome moderate and here's
your ears your password now in corporate

331
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,369
environments lot of times you're you're
using the bus was gonna be

332
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:26,200
pre-configured to enforce a source
complexity right and it will check

333
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,720
Tories typically what comes with that
complexity of your Active Directory

334
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:42,950
every member of the settings of cum

335
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:55,930
number of characters so it's it's an
awesome your crisis gotta be numbers and

336
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:05,220
characters concept phone numbers so it's
a city can be no it's not very complex

337
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:10,980
pattern and users who use your words a
lot of times and prevent a number on the

338
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:18,589
end just to match set pattern and to be
able to achieve that right but it's you

339
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:25,390
know as far as far as the corporate
environments you'll find is that it to

340
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,420
corporate complexity does not make that
possible words you're not a single

341
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,680
numbers source for something like this

342
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:42,259
like well c'mon you know your eight
characters and that makes it makes it

343
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,840
easy for somebody to 47 yes

344
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:56,750
so many questions voted Emma

345
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:06,840
base area actually gonna Google was a
PDE this is Josh right she died calm I

346
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,500
gotta give him credit and its
reconfigured Oct can just google it you

347
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:22,220
can find out what over but it's
definitely not something that my stories

348
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,500
right down to it is you know your house
of cards are here

349
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:45,400
get at 4:30 sides $40 online Prosecco
viewer your taxes for now so how do we

350
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:53,310
address this obviously some concerns
over safety check make sure the device

351
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:02,750
is configured properly your laptops and
desktops easier to to to address how do

352
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:11,280
you handle your devices as concern now
some companies look at the WPA PSK and

353
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:23,710
what are some concerns with that said
really a surprise surprise whatsoever

354
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:30,589
exactly a less depreciation or even a
small company at 1% lease after a techie

355
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:34,009
right so the same cliche but everybody

356
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,359
designed to work for places and what
you'll find is because the traffic you

357
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:46,290
know every user every secret Mb take
good care became his shared so I'm user

358
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:52,200
can see how to use traffic monitoring
wireless networks the question is are

359
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,098
you comfortable with your employees seen
here in OC use traffic levels connected

360
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:00,270
over a PBS

361
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:13,790
not surprised its case in point
themselves at PSK stored do you have

362
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:20,400
your USX devices that goes we're
teaching the break the device get your

363
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,109
text CSKA Android would be supplicant
config file will have that figured as

364
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,080
well so the limits operating systems and
Windows who have your wireless network

365
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,250
from Thailand here goes

366
00:44:36,250 --> 00:45:19,950
there as well

367
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:36,669
our our laptop to accept connections and
set it up soon so when we compromise and

368
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:43,640
enjoy it on rooted android song with
malicious application that automatically

369
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,879
connect to us and that's what those
steps are going through is setting up

370
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:00,130
kind of your load to send off to the
target so then you are saying that up

371
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:11,030
getting that already

372
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:44,130
same thing here's the link to download
this a target Android devices sold at

373
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:53,490
application apk file and so did you from
moderate in an Android how is that

374
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:03,270
different from from iOS four questions
over there is reason that iOS device

375
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:09,900
provided to you and he was selling it it
said what it said it is licensed in 1642

376
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,230
ticket to your trusted stored on secure
ports to get you trust store and then

377
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:23,120
we'll also configure wireless wireless
network and you know a denver also work

378
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,020
to their networks to connect to an
Android you can see the list is quite a

379
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,860
bit different right it's a lot more
information there but what do people

380
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,540
normally use then looking at each of
those requests each of those

381
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,020
capabilities application as having
Android device it will be technically

382
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,200
yes

383
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:47,859
and they want writes this year says he's
gonna do all these readings indicate

384
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:54,920
only step of access when you're on your
device and the Google Sikri 2001 and up

385
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,160
occasionally installing this is a
malicious app is installed the device

386
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:07,540
now stays itself nothing special there
and then we going back to the attackers

387
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,190
sports writer

388
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:45,319
Sept it connects now it's a camera for
example to the back ever see you could

389
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:51,790
get that you're targeting you can call
it targeted put it up next to their

390
00:48:51,790 --> 00:49:00,109
picture taken and you know what that
does goes ahead and takes picture on the

391
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:05,130
device and if they have it up and
download that picture down to your

392
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:14,170
target to your Xbox for that truck
driver is basically from Sam Khan couple

393
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:20,810
years ago I was standing there sexy
picture thing you can do is you can

394
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:25,420
record a microphone in your home

395
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:32,470
and hear that that's what it's doing its
recording 20 seconds of audio on the

396
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,430
phone

397
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:49,950
asylum and then you can play

398
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:58,129
to a file you can play in a year
whatever semi same as somebody around

399
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:58,760
them

400
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,800
comedians at the board meeting some kind
of an important meeting or a person has

401
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:11,800
a pocket right what else can we do that
we can do is we can get all the files on

402
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,920
the fossil on the on sdcard because
every time about the case has read

403
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:24,609
rights is hard but he told and here we
are seeing what else is downloaded there

404
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,089
now

405
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:29,240
something you have to remember is when
you're on your Android phone that you

406
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:35,270
open a file and you use that style is it
actually gets downloaded to be now

407
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:45,770
provided call when you open this
important document the new phone is here

408
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,550
is another nobel cases like this when
installing new phone and then that more

409
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:56,690
about the cases have access and in this
case we're downloading the file 1 2011

410
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:01,980
his top secret report right here

411
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:12,470
file its content then just kind of
comparison to remind you we did you know

412
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,129
I S device than we did

413
00:51:14,130 --> 00:52:01,890
into its own as well compared to two so
let's wrap it up and regions

414
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:09,549
alright so couple things to be aware of
the risks with mobile devices we covered

415
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:15,550
it's free trade your concern you or your
e-mail going through and somebody is

416
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:21,830
selling a conure on your mobile device
iOS device Android device and be able to

417
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:26,410
intercept that email communication the
communion world and your devices beyond

418
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:31,859
my proxy through them and because you
have to us so as a matter can still see

419
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:37,690
your YouTube password going to go to
Texas Inc and we talked about you know

420
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,350
your wireless alarms WP to a price

421
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:46,580
considerations and how you're like a
slap on some dramatic reading gave you

422
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:52,509
that scoring it was fake but they had
received in our society as you over here

423
00:52:52,510 --> 00:53:00,020
and then the lasting economy to
reiterate Android the most severe cases

424
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:06,540
concerned there's so few of those series
premiere at dark and that in mind

425
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,810
sides are on a website skreened.com you
can download the money resources

426
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:16,549
presentations is my contact information
