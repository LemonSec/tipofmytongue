1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:30,270
anybody thank you you are the true
pioneers so this is a to Chris's

2
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,160
resources Chris Mills both researchers
have recovered and this is basically of

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:47,629
lutein cock places to hide and so they
could this is the fly our job is hard

4
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,390
talkin by are the good guys in general
and so if you want to dig sites later

5
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,319
and use that it go to your boss is why I
need to raise that's kind of what it's

6
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:56,859
for

7
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:02,100
so we're going to talk about about a
specific scenes techniques places that

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,750
the bad guys used to hide to make life
harder the as telling Christie

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,149
interesting seeing as most of the stuff
the bad guys didn't have the bill

10
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:20,479
reminds me of the room in towards the
required requirements wear whatever you

11
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,149
need the room gives you a lot of this
stuff it's like the bad guys really

12
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,540
needed something and the internet
provided for

13
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:40,090
comes up over and over again so I
researched and published and what we

14
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,100
haven't and then where to go to find it
interesting that it's basically worried

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,119
about you make this discovery right to
worry about the first week of wonders

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,580
and so this research came from what we
call the most interesting part of the

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:08,000
web so basic web database so things that
come in the park database like it's a

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,700
new site right out of the weed some
interesting right that's where the

19
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:24,730
recent day we have a system that tracks
the not in the database stuff like a

20
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,040
year ago when we didn't this particular
site

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,620
six million things that are active that
day in the traffic logs are not yet in

22
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,790
the database and start breaking down by
traffic in normal and not normal

23
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:49,320
the PhD who was building machine
classification system for this to take a

24
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,829
step at saying what something is when I
see the third request

25
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,940
and so I was looking at that but the
staff John there's two-thirds of the

26
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:18,560
things that happened one or two requests
that's it it's a million things that

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,420
only one or two requests in 24 hours
what's going on in there so the first

28
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,390
thing is to segment this is the hosts
over light-colored segments now are the

29
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:41,299
things that are new that day so they're
not just not in the database and so you

30
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:54,110
end up with is basically right now what
is it what do you know about this thing

31
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,850
and it's brand new and it's got requests
worldwide so there's there's a lot of

32
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,470
talk right now in the security space was
big data right and now it's it's a lie

33
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:16,798
cuz that's how you have to deal with big
data is about using a machine learning

34
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,060
to find a normal things right

35
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,650
your network traffic is mostly that's
good I love good mix of good and evil

36
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:36,099
and what the date is telling us is that
there are a whole lot of anomalies

37
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,680
alright this is a big thing we submitted
several research paper RSA Bsafe what do

38
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:52,380
you do when you have a whole haystack
you start to pick up circling research

39
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:00,560
funders and gets to talk so one day
wonders was looking more

40
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,360
the question is this normal for building
a model of what's normal looking at

41
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,370
traffic levels and if you think about
the really big internet properties their

42
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,770
normal is a ton of traffic all day every
day but most sites are debit and so if

43
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,430
you look at what's normal for all of the
up millions of other sites on the web

44
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,080
more data points and Alexa does so well
done so in this research we were looking

45
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,890
at a 90 day window of traffic

46
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,340
most of which is already in the database
a lot of its gonna be Google and

47
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,530
Facebook and Twitter and other sites
right but in the 90 day period there

48
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,190
were over 660 million unique cokes and
the little asterisks

49
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,760
personally disastrous

50
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,610
a sub-domain a domain and IP whatever
the base of the year that's the hugs

51
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:08,310
660 million rico's the missiles what
made us go surprised because I think it

52
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,500
does surprises in me and I work in the
space that it's probably gonna be

53
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,460
interesting to other people too so this
is Luis away and we going on these sites

54
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,320
today and the good news is that most of
them there is a white paper on this

55
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:36,490
website last year so this this is normal
it's not normal after all because six of

56
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,790
the top 10 current hopes of most of
these things are content delivery

57
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,210
networks to the biggest lender is
google.com as Google's image and make

58
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,840
these really hairy subdomains these
unique subdomains that apparently in

59
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,530
code stuff like the user users geo
session IDs at like that so that Google

60
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,469
can tell you which image server
somewhere in the world should be used to

61
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,760
send the image for this request must
work really well because they do so much

62
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,890
of it but there are six of the top 10 or
CD as the do that they generate these

63
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:24,780
big long did you get da Gama generation
computer-generated are being used the

64
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,190
other side of the top 10 were three blog
posts like Tumblr blog spot

65
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:37,080
because they encode the name of the blog
that he is the sub-domain tumblr.com

66
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,750
this is saying is there are literally
millions of blogs that arson nominally

67
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,900
unpopular right that you make this blog
about whatever you tell your friend your

68
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,650
friend goes there

69
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,460
Coetzee's bad traffic to this tumblr
site and the crickets for the next three

70
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,169
days so we can see that will allow your
friends I yes what to say most people do

71
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:10,110
not have a loyal friends in the bloggers
right now did you go beyond the top 10

72
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,150
legitimate unsafe you this right here is
an example of an angler exploit can so

73
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:24,190
that have messed up com is you were
compromised oh man that's a legitimate

74
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:31,690
demand and if you go there directly it
looks like a normal domain but twenty

75
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,469
sometimes even a hundred different
subdomains that would probably will need

76
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,599
them for less than 24 hours and they
would get tons and tons of heads for

77
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,290
like 10 hours then disappear because
they were just rotate through abusing

78
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:52,140
this same domain name over and over and
over again is not just saying right

79
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,860
there's a couple other expatriates that
also do this for fun technique is the

80
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,910
biggest right now

81
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,079
neutrino so does it we've seen similar
things with it makes it very difficult

82
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,070
to track

83
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:13,800
it's not like saying it's it's like that

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:26,479
signatory have seen the results do to
make this is flexing the sub-domain uses

85
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:37,160
a few minutes and then the other one and
so typical website builder you don't try

86
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,770
to block the domain because the domain
is it changing so that we can truly

87
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:51,980
change the unique hosts like he said

88
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,880
domain there will sometimes speeches
about domain where you don't know man

89
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,240
week is bad guys can log in to his
internet hosting and generate new

90
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,520
records

91
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,140
a lot of these are part if you go to the
root domain is parked on GoDaddy and so

92
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,980
did the bad guy said did a legitimate I
set it up and just go to a password is

93
00:10:18,980 --> 00:12:56,850
helped by the bed

94
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,839
the season make the cloud attractive to
the good guys also make the cloud

95
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,300
attracted to the bad guys the bad guys
did not have to build Amazon Cloud

96
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:14,920
Player software again the internet tripp
Lite's and the bad guys can see the

97
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:23,170
Bombers no one is going to block
amazon.com Amazon space because it's

98
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:36,149
it's legitimate sites so you can read
out the bad guys one by one and even

99
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,259
like even two years ago we considered
Amazon ec2 house thing we see something

100
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:47,529
on there and that's it would cause way
too much collateral but nowadays we can

101
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:54,069
probably will probably have to leave
certain IP even if their Amazon Cloud

102
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:59,649
Hosting we can afford to just let it run
wild basin they say goodnight faster

103
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:07,149
this this is unpublished research we
have not gone in a normalized for

104
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:12,100
something as basic as we really
shouldn't be showing I sections calling

105
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,930
Amazon evil right and they're
responsible but this is a key conference

106
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,380
responsibilities are but the ideas

107
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,810
normalized for the size of the IP space
right that Amazon has before you can say

108
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,758
Amazon is more or less bad that somebody
else and yes we know the clouds is not

109
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,310
actually posting content

110
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,640
but externally that's how it appears the
other sites easily treated them as a

111
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:54,390
writer yes question

112
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:01,189
yes they've been tracking an attack
against the university and Amazon said

113
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,980
very responsive benders you report abuse
to them they jump on it pretty quick

114
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,310
CloudFlare less so colleges affiliated
clubs John talked about like the

115
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,089
specific kinds of stuff we are already
covered that this is an example of a

116
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,040
while traffic now sit on it you get
stuck at the time this was just a parked

117
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,780
domain

118
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:33,670
sitting on Amazon ec2 server but it was
spitting out this venue is using that CD

119
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,729
traffic and this was churning out loads
and loads of traffic and if you check

120
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,020
the IP o's Amazon AP and this was the
only traffic there's this one was easier

121
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,579
because

122
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,690
however they gained access to it
negative their own IP on ec2 or

123
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,600
compromise somebody else's

124
00:15:51,600 --> 00:16:00,720
using it as a seat but with that we can
block it now but in the future that he

125
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,540
might go back into those they're cool
and I get to shoot it to somebody else's

126
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,770
which makes it a lot more difficult to
track and always keep on top of the way

127
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,220
there was a really cool research article
from another company published a couple

128
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:22,280
weeks ago looked into the question since
it is so easy to set up and use it for a

129
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:30,370
project that never happens to those
things after abandoned you think about

130
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,000
this big corporation X and I haven't got
a team that's doing a project we create

131
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,460
a sub-domain called Project . big
corporation x.com project no

132
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:51,120
the result of that project the amazon
Server goes away if I get to remove the

133
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,370
DNS entry I now have a sub-domain on my
domain and authoritative DNS server

134
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,150
telling the internet bath it still
mapping to that Amazon I P so now if I

135
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:12,730
can get to the site on that I P I can
create a page that looks like dot com

136
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,589
corporation says DNS servers gonna tell
the world that yes project Dot

137
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:24,300
corporation right there and it looks
like the perfect ischemia or any other

138
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,250
kind of brand abuse like boots gotta
clean up after yourself and it's really

139
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,880
easy to set out thanks to Amazon did
some research where they looked at a

140
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,230
bunch of amateur keys and then did
reverse lookup to see you out there that

141
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:48,600
still have subdomains that their results
their stuff to worry about ideas until

142
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,490
days before Christmas to keep me on task
I was talking earlier on top level

143
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:04,180
domains worldwide web up and running and
we have six three-letter remains a bunch

144
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,290
of two other country codes and it stays
this way for more than a decade ago in

145
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,960
1998 we add two new utilities

146
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,020
and if you're like most people you and
you may have seen it . name for a

147
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,950
Doctrove

148
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,000
most people have not run into the same
none of them really other than that in

149
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,159
so never really got widespread use and
its more famous for abuse then good

150
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,179
usage and so there are a couple of years
where they added a few more in 2011 they

151
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:45,110
added . xxx porn sites and the news that
was newsworthy news release this into

152
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,629
your brain game and then the internet
went nuts

153
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,919
years ago so I asked how many legitimate
valid peel these are in use on the

154
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:08,669
Internet today and I said is a more or
less than 500 600 700 800 900 but that

155
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:15,760
we passed a thousand valid till these in
use in July and it's it's ramping up

156
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:23,289
like this right this is just a through
seas for months ago so what happens we

157
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:29,830
notice that one day I was obvious I dot
country you are else in the locks and

158
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:38,990
consumed spam and some kind of traffic
so I went in the security of the doc

159
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,740
country traffic we had over the past
week wondering how many good domains

160
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:52,480
were mixed in with this man every domain
active domain on . country that week was

161
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,230
he someone you shouldn't

162
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,910
. country everything . country a gateway
there is nothing work going there the

163
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:11,090
whole TLD space so we actually reported
two months ago and we we named the top

164
00:20:11,090 --> 00:21:44,000
10 shiite-led he's got a lot of slack
initially about

165
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,159
the track

166
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,909
that we're seeing in our logs his
request for dogs if you are else they

167
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:56,070
don't resolve a lot of them have really
interesting means right

168
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:06,239
PDF . sip ok it's that URL URL URL
because it's in the web site is in the

169
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:14,320
web traffic to do with this your web
security company because it doesn't

170
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,799
exist and it sure is right and that's
your only way to signal hey something's

171
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:25,129
wrong here that was a spam email
attachment I guarantee it but somehow it

172
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:31,529
leaked out of the email client as a web
request also we have security teams at a

173
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:36,799
number of very big organizations that
know their stuff we like daily they'll

174
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,229
send us a list a bad idea these domains
scene that's being used in malicious

175
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:48,039
code please put this in your database
and guess what she has in it sometimes

176
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,710
thats URLs ok so if we have a security
team at a major financial institution

177
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:04,739
telling us that which is URL goes in the
database also God for saying that a

178
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:07,759
hundred percent of DOC review is evil

179
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,300
we're not saying that domain

180
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:19,520
ondru exhaustively is saying is that
everything that we have raided in our

181
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,580
database has a bad rating ok that's a
hundred percent defensible because it's

182
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,179
simple database of the ratings soared
with the doc review extension the

183
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:38,860
categories Bell whereby at suspicious
scam where or fishing then it's bad and

184
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,790
a hundred percent of the dot reducing
our database at that time had one of

185
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,040
those categories but it's scary when you
look there's a whole bunch of tea oldies

186
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,350
more than 95% of everything that we have
come to our attention so we say that's a

187
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:59,990
bad rating if they do change and so for
plus a couple months this is what it

188
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,970
looks like there is no longer a hundred
percent because I want an integrated

189
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,300
Google domain that's legitimate

190
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:13,919
technology and so it's not a person this
is kinda looks like and that these

191
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,350
dropped out and there is a bunch of new
ones coming in

192
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:25,149
accountant ok to three takeaways from
same kind you can go home and block .

193
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,100
accountant with impunity

194
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,129
bad right now

195
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,570
we don't have time to go into shady
ideas but basically the idea here is

196
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:40,560
there's a single unit code that is the
universal character coding system so it

197
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,520
contains every house a better conductor
graphic symbol from every human language

198
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,490
ever it's got the Klingon in there not
the Klingon written in English letters

199
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,790
asking letters but the clean on script
they developed through the movies to put

200
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,620
on labels on things going on worshipers
walking through that the guy took some

201
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:06,840
an ancient tibetan because the letter
said the Klingon language that looks

202
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:16,240
like it's written with knife in their
right there's there's stuff in there at

203
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,470
the top of this you can mix and match
the Wikipedia examples there's to

204
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,870
wikipedia.org they're starting to be
used in the early 2008 was a recognized

205
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,560
that you could have all sorts of
interesting stitching and Brenda tax

206
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,679
hits you mixed and matched

207
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,660
wikipedia.org you copied and pasted from
the slide into your browser address bar

208
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,660
it would go to wikipedia.org I think
it's the first 1 I'm not sure the other

209
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:51,910
one doesn't because only the W the case
are asking voters the others are also

210
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,780
really felt about equivalents so one of
the things I'll do is a good registry

211
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,490
will try to block you from mixing

212
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:08,390
asking you try to submit eight
characters and otherwise they're

213
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:15,700
supposed to be they don't always so if
you look at the Blue Coat example that's

214
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:55,549
actually not a reserved trademark symbol
that's illegal

215
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,999
cue card

216
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:03,959
and then everything after the dash dash
is the Unicode part and coding system

217
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:12,269
for all kinds of games you can play this
really started getting used to the way

218
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,029
to thousands and we had kind of ignored
it because we've gone in and look to see

219
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:23,219
if make sure tools could handle Unicode
in Unicode ok so you do that sir that's

220
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:28,509
the first break things right so you want
to make sure your systems and then you

221
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,429
look at security they are the bad guys
doing that kind of stuff no they're not

222
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,319
in 2010 there were some things out there
to watch out for attacks like this but

223
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,908
it's not happening yet so we can ignore
that and then we saw in 2013 2012 2013

224
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:48,989
the one of our automated tools that
sounded bad sites and had been dutifully

225
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:55,089
putting tens of thousands of bad and
they were they were malicious code names

226
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:00,438
into the database interestingly we
presented at RSA the beginning of 2014

227
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:06,649
and the usage of bad stuff plummeted as
trending up to get the bad guys didn't

228
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:10,569
create Unicode didn't create unique code
but they're there to take advantage of

229
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:18,759
it they didn't register all of those
steel diese cost $185,000 to register

230
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,719
top-level domain too bad I guarantee the
bad guys are not registering top-level

231
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:25,350
domains like that but there be

232
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:31,270
to take advantage . science was giving
away three domain registrations and our

233
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,460
science if you do that I guarantee you
the bad guys will be registering us

234
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,580
consistently the top down what she said
we'd seen that quite a bit now ok so

235
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:50,059
mobile is as with most things and
security Pyramide you have this is in

236
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,500
our database where we're going and
looking for malicious AP case and as you

237
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,919
can see this month by month it was very
very little and he'll around November

238
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,460
2014 and then December January just
rocking where somebody rating tens of

239
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,630
thousands of militias they became so how
many years has the security industry in

240
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,480
general been trying to scare corporate
America with the mobile malware tsunami

241
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,150
is coming and going at least three or
four years right well it actually in

242
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,390
January we finally got the mobile
malware Toonami in the world is going to

243
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:33,210
end and then on the other hand you have
Verizon 15 DBI edi our report

244
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,500
where they even call out I got 99
problems and mobile browser isn't even

245
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,440
one percent of them they go so far as to
downplay mobile mountain now we're very

246
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,899
significantly they say most of the stuff
on Android but that's an average 2003

247
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:55,860
percent of times per week so it's a
network it's kinda it hardly even worth

248
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,949
mentioning really rare actually sees
where there's the stuff that happens

249
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,850
where it's bad but that's not trying to
steal your contacts and swam out

250
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:15,639
information so we tell people don't
jailbreak your phone don't download

251
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:23,299
stuff from sites other than the official
downloader app store massages

252
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:29,100
jailbreak your phone and you're OK and
then you generally don't live in russia

253
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:44,449
and China most of the country and lots
of other hand is not so severe

254
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:52,690
where do we go on the gripping hand
sense the Verizon gets it represents

255
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:58,570
this is the this is from the mote in
God's eye injury produced a race

256
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:05,620
Modi's they have three arms to have the
arms are small and have very dexterous

257
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,780
fingers those are for you know delegate
tasks that the other arm girls out of

258
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:15,710
their chest tattoo sticker price thanks
so in their language they have an

259
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:21,940
expression that says on the one hand on
the other hand on the gripping and this

260
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,800
actually works really well for this
situation because they're DBA our report

261
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,330
we see two major mobile malware threats
emerge the first being staged tract

262
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:39,080
which was a radical where researchers
found a problem where you could send a

263
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:46,419
video that's message and you can exploit
characters he tried library which is

264
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,400
what combat

265
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,980
every version of Android version of
entering and you could do good execution

266
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,300
which is exactly what you want but it
was the big news right here to states

267
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,470
right and if you're like me that was the
first time that I still sit down with my

268
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,770
wife and children all of whom have
Android smartphones and have a talk

269
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:15,300
about security and the scary part about
say tried it it didn't require the user

270
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,520
to MMS and click it just arriving on was
enough

271
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,129
scary enough at least one of the major
European telecoms blocked MMS traffic on

272
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,520
their networks when this was announced
for like a week there is no MMS traffic

273
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,050
there until they could get a handle on
what they're actually attacks in the

274
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,649
wild using this patch is coming

275
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:42,140
in the first time I have to say well
maybe I should have bought iPhones from

276
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,950
kids instead of that wasn't for me that
was a game-changer Google responded

277
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,020
pretty quickly you know saying they
would that stuff but the problem is with

278
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,220
the phone with Android is that the times
it's not Google say and when something

279
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:03,310
gets past the goalie ends their own path
schedule and you rely on band actually a

280
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:08,929
shower your phone and he's got an old
phone they don't want to put out updates

281
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:14,900
day rather you just say and so they
don't want to actually update so this is

282
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,770
a threat that is an island all Android
phones all of Google's got matched

283
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,129
against a relatively quickly

284
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,410
Samsung was really aggressive depends
there's a not just the current model to

285
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:32,050
go back and pushed attitude but
manufacturers your mileage may vary

286
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,399
there's no you don't really know if your
device is protected unless you actually

287
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,890
go out and look also it turned out after
black hat that the patches that the guy

288
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:45,000
who discovered discovered this was a
good citizen he submitted the

289
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,090
vulnerabilities found back to the
Android code base and they were

290
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,669
incorporated turned out after blackheads
other researchers report the golden

291
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:58,240
shovel passes were successful closing
the whole way around some of them so

292
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,690
he's still not seeing the world wide
epidemic dead and dying Android phones

293
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,600
because it's a trite but for me that was
the first time that I actually worried

294
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,389
about what was coming into my end

295
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:20,929
ok the other one is nothing to do with
stage fright its golden locks and it's a

296
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:30,960
threat to go ahead with the locker it
was a threat that people would get on

297
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,799
their funds either through benedek is so
stick to the store some people down in

298
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:45,469
locker rooms a mess they typically
served what they thought was a porn

299
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:52,658
video bruising apk apk good run and if
you've got your jailbroken your shoe box

300
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:58,069
in and check that you can install
third-party case it would install and it

301
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:04,650
would change the venue change the pin
and you were literally walked out here

302
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:12,869
if you want to try to guess combinations
it was somewhere in the first really

303
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:18,200
nasty successful and trade routes and
other stuff you could recover from UCI

304
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,750
rebooting your phone and this was an
actual legit and then walk down on your

305
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,099
phone because it legitimately changed
their plan to a random 42 random numbers

306
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,589
the bad guys did not know what they
changed into they didn't want to go to

307
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,410
the effort to change it

308
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:45,868
random but you ended up doing research
and there goes your data so they were

309
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:50,259
holding your ADA hostage you get you
contact Teresa but how many people have

310
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:53,470
all of the photos they have backed up
all the time

311
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:59,000
smart people yes but that's a very small
percentage of Android phone users would

312
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,440
actually be up to date with guns so rare
somewhere in general deal if you look at

313
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,140
the trajectory of stupid read somewhere
in the early days of the stuff like

314
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,379
crippled Walker and the others that do
it right it's easy to look at ransomware

315
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,730
on the motels and project the same kind
of curves like sometime in 2016 we're

316
00:36:17,730 --> 00:38:12,570
going to see a crystal Walker style

317
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,619
and it wouldn't even go

318
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:20,359
you take a look at the same thing my
days and you can have whatever you want

319
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:27,509
recently cool encryption texted this is
critical in particular characters that

320
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:36,450
it needs to jailbreak your phone
downloads magician sources in China

321
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:42,348
Russia and you're still pretty safe but
it's easy to worry about the trend is

322
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:47,190
that the mobile malware is getting
better even though I still write it

323
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,880
hasn't really been used in a major
attack yet still more of individual user

324
00:38:51,880 --> 00:39:03,529
problem worry so encrypted traffic so if
you look at the top 50 sites traffic

325
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:11,549
it's the ones you'd expect this is
largely thanks to Edward snowed in the

326
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:17,380
NSA neither of them were created by the
bad guys but the hysteria around privacy

327
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:26,739
and inspiring traffic there's there are
growing running everything over HTTPS

328
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:33,279
currently the only popular sites that
are high traffic sites that don't fit

329
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:39,920
together by default things like ESPN and
CNN and other news and media is nothing

330
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,779
for spying on their traffickers too much
hassle but the trend is that way to go

331
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:53,450
only HTTPS traffic in a typical
organization's network would be going to

332
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,868
a site where you can actually buy
something and you went to the Shopping

333
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:03,109
Cart page they would switch to ATT
padlock and that's how you knew your

334
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,450
credit card delinquency

335
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,140
but less than 1 percent of your web
traffic even on the shopping sites like

336
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:18,400
Amazon HTTP up to that end up in there
to do your your order now it's pretty

337
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,859
common to hear

338
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,598
30% it's probably the average Brit
typical organization 40% it's very

339
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,990
common for a lot organizations that 40%
of our traffic now leaving our network

340
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:38,240
is HTTPS have no idea what's in there
I've heard of the trend it's everything

341
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:46,970
that's a couple of years of your web
traffic maybe HTTPS so there's two

342
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,770
problems

343
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:56,180
defender safe where they can get in to
the HTTPS stream coming in to whatever

344
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,310
solutions you have in place to look for
malware your sandbox can't find malware

345
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:06,339
in SSL traffic your aidid IDs can see
patterns to drag in the traffic thanks

346
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:12,380
in Section already in your network in
the box or whatever in ours is

347
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,650
restrictions trading data if that's an
HTTPS stream again you're blind whatever

348
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,050
that is it safe to do what's been goin
out of my network HTTPS so it must be

349
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:29,859
safe secure and safe marketing used to
come to me and say we did some scary

350
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:37,310
stories about us so we can sell more
stuff there isn't any

351
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,759
every now and then randomly the bad guys
who get lucky and happy outside that

352
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,750
happens to have SSL certificate and then
there's an HDV SEO you accidentally

353
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,670
might happen but now the bad guys are
not doing this now where traffic in the

354
00:41:53,670 --> 00:42:01,610
botnet once there was an exciting for
them so I had to change my tune albert

355
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:13,570
is attractive because I'm gonna buy a
lot of defenses but to actually do it

356
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:19,210
a certificate and it's got a match from
a trusted authority it's not a match the

357
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,270
domain name I've set up and if you think
about it back to the one day 12 research

358
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:33,759
domain of two hours before the good guys
all blocking that it's bad and so to go

359
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,860
to the money credit cards cell service
providers I don't get it right away

360
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:49,150
there's time for them to discover that
was signed certificate the browser

361
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,560
Sinestro warning you most users will
just click through the warning right but

362
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,000
still some user that will that will cool
down a bit

363
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:11,470
yourself as the bad guy if we started to
see where the payload was on a

364
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:19,060
file-sharing site so there are a lot of
other things to wear a link to Dropbox

365
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:29,610
we asked whose organization gangster

366
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:38,700
couple places will say no there could be
anything going down that we want to

367
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,770
better control over what we don't want
our employees like putting stuff because

368
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:59,630
apparently the trend is is getting away
from rocking that stuff on the HTTPS my

369
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,220
teeth because you're not going to use
the services like Dropbox it didn't give

370
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:11,129
you a HTTPS secure but they're happy to
use that because it makes it easy

371
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:19,350
because I trust you because they get
three HTTPS and other senior was we're

372
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,290
seeing the second stage malware

373
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:29,370
black services you can pay to have
installed on computers

374
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:37,660
crypto locker because the AMEX make it
very appealing if you're getting a 10 15

375
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,149
20 percent commercial on your victims
will cave in and pay the ransom

376
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:50,329
do the math it's easy to put together to
dance around somewhere on a computer

377
00:44:50,329 --> 00:45:02,020
charging $100 rounds victims like put it
on her gonna pay the ransom ransom where

378
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,730
with the locker is what she really
showed economists were observed took off

379
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,440
so there is a dire that's like the major
banking Trojan in the world for the last

380
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,480
couple years and it's then using a 20
inch where you first get a small piece

381
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,390
of malware called you operate all your
Padres job is established on the target

382
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:29,618
computer go out and down the real it's
easier for the best guy to get a little

383
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:37,349
load as you can fit that into shelters a
one megabyte malware thing she'll go

384
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:48,390
right so it's easier to get a little
music did UPS to put something down that

385
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:54,980
handshake that would have happened to
one of the URL HTTPS your browser's

386
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,210
gonna draw warning expired ourselves or
a non-matching otherwise invalid

387
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:09,930
certificate holder it's what story it's
gonna ignore the doesn't care to

388
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:17,149
indicate the people on it so there's no
because it's not happening in the

389
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,110
morning for the user

390
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:33,300
so guys back wins the big making a
couple of researchers in Switzerland so

391
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:42,400
2014 they added SSL is a subdomain in it
started tracking SSL certificates that

392
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,790
were being used by malware families and
I looked at this in eighty eight starts

393
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:54,140
as of September they were up to 700 to
search the cool thing is a list of

394
00:46:54,140 --> 00:47:00,839
malware families that are using these
basically two dozen or so different

395
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:07,880
malware families that are using HTTPS
control traffic signals interesting

396
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,060
though is back in March when they have
588 certificates a dire and when I

397
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:23,480
looked at the $700 should be there even
if it's stopped using this is his first

398
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:33,780
Oracle reasons but said it's over here
is a separately think twenty-seven

399
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:41,910
megabyte CSV file with over 300,000 SSL
Certificates listed in dire is now self

400
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,370
signing it she's also a certificate of
minutes that's how rapidly they're

401
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,690
rolling it out

402
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:57,060
to this kind of service for me you were
gonna say that it's fast so cryptic CTV

403
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,420
locker is one of the ransom RCM pls and
if you look at each stage that attack it

404
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:09,140
was using HTTPS encryption files with
elliptic curve the traffic control

405
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,609
associate or and payment is due to
currency

406
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:47,130
everything about this involves some kind
of encryption and that's it

407
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:55,710
to be an entire network layer that's not
so you can do things like email chat and

408
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:01,740
project is meant for you know
whistle-blowers political dissidents to

409
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:09,500
try to protect them and so they can
clean up the world through the bad they

410
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,580
didn't invent ITP they didn't send a
link to the doctor she did it to the

411
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,930
requirements room provided for them but
I do BBBJ and an entirely anonymous

412
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:28,009
network layer is a wonderful you can do
whatever you want whatever you want in

413
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,980
this incomplete anonymity and so one of
our researchers and your brand

414
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,290
discovered it

415
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:38,640
text or speaking now by the way
discovered it in February and it was

416
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,089
rudimentary but it existed but by March
they had basically

417
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:50,080
release it was working well and it was
going through as you can see all of this

418
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,779
I 2 p.m. traffic it so it's like going
to toy when I have no idea where it came

419
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,460
from or where it's going

420
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,130
didn't know what it was either you get
to Google and scary part of this traffic

421
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,420
is that this traffic was also SSL
encrypted so the only reason we're able

422
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,950
to tell it was going to I 2 p.m. is
because we cracked open the package so

423
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,879
that it's going to ITV

424
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,450
and so but then that's where the trail
basically ended routinely runs all the

425
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,089
traffic lights to decrypt the SSL and
that's when he started seeing the

426
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:26,359
takeaway for this is here something that
the average good guy has not even heard

427
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:33,819
the bad guy said not only heard about it
could be used and the final deployment

428
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:37,119
within a few months and they were
rewarded album taking advantage of what

429
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,000
else to take advantage of one of these
things that the internet providers were

430
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:51,769
the better systems so this is Alyssa sea
bees and their other elderly basic sort

431
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:56,288
of admin hardcoded town that passwords
and this is such that you take your door

432
00:50:56,289 --> 00:51:03,690
that would be TV's 1995 96 out by now
this from 2014 but this is a problem

433
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:09,859
that happens today article in admin
passwords at black hat there was so

434
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:15,269
hopelessly broken competition where they
were looking at and this is a script

435
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:20,220
kiddie blizzard squads spread that they
would just get on your network just

436
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,209
brute force and even tried to detect
what modem you had it would just go to

437
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:28,119
192 168 01 just trying every

438
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,789
admin admin as the user account password
at the address it expects to find the

439
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,490
modem at

440
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,848
and it's busy trying to set the DNS
primary secondary DNS IPs are the bad

441
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:46,580
guys choosing there's thousands of lines
in this script so there's just

442
00:51:46,580 --> 00:52:07,740
yes

443
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:21,618
a bunch of different to find a router
and then using ten different common

444
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:25,180
passwords to try to get in and it was
exceeding about 20 percent of the time

445
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:35,839
tested and some others so this is like
strip but tits other in order to

446
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:43,440
organize groups are taking Trojans water
on the computer for malware was changing

447
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,410
the DNS on the router so the bad guys
were sending you to the bank site and

448
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:59,500
you know take certificate stuff like the
bank but that's the using the router

449
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,850
time to talk about inception this may be
to use layers of command control one of

450
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:11,790
those routers they were using a proxy so
we have to talk about some things you

451
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:20,119
can do you look at the tires banking
malware these days and he's a

452
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:27,350
self-written generate certificates for
three games so you can knock out a third

453
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:34,700
of the traffic just by saying I'm gonna
block SSL traffic that isn't 1443 and

454
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,558
that would get something

455
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:42,769
tickets will be another one so you can
watch for his traffic on a non standard

456
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,538
port traffic on court three that isn't
SSL

457
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:51,630
site about expired cell site
certificates and because this is

458
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:58,279
happening in the knot in the browser but
in the background you have to wait so

459
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:02,299
you can have your daily proxy say I'm
not going to allow itself connections

460
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:07,949
using some of these things I can break
the connections in the certificate I'm

461
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:15,049
not gonna trust I don't care who's
making the connection with overall as a

462
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:19,538
recommendation when you're considering
security budget by invest certain people

463
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:25,130
would rather have people than smart box
on my team and I would rather try

464
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:31,119
solutions that give me visibility into
my traffic by magic box is that gets

465
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,099
tough

466
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:48,289
embedded devices the problem is that
it's not a computer with the desktop and

467
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:51,700
you can see what's running on it not
time yet no idea what it's doing

468
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:57,009
you have most people don't even look to
see what it's doing to your home router

469
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:03,670
and check your router itself is doing i
mean goes down you'll get to see what's

470
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:09,750
going on but beyond their probably
rarely and a lot of the times you can

471
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:15,820
gain access to the router and can just
run as much as they once one of the best

472
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,950
ways to overcome that you said we need
to stop pressuring manufacturers to

473
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:24,430
think about security over as if you're
like me and you do have a problem so you

474
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:29,750
do into your home router the links a
check for updates

475
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:37,079
guess how many times I've seen an update
for my router and Lesley pressure the

476
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:44,060
manufacturers that's not going to change
another part of awareness is gonna be

477
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,000
telling people because he liked people
that come to us as we know all about

478
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,609
these horrible security problems but
that's that's a very small percentage of

479
00:55:53,609 --> 00:56:00,450
the population I mean look at it when
they came out like at Descon and wired

480
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:05,598
it was huge and then GM's thanks and
yeah there's a lot of debate about where

481
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,200
they grandstanding

482
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:16,569
jurors and and the public have taken as
seriously had they not done

483
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:23,300
arguably no and so to a certain extent
unfortunately is happy to make noise

484
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:30,020
about it do some spectacular things to
get enough attention to get things fixed

485
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,590
that sometimes I came out there was
always a big deal and news organizations

486
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:44,540
are talking about it and then it got
sixteen dress down i mean we'd like to

487
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,860
see that were smart enough security guys
that when something comes out we have

488
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:57,550
time to read the serious clear my
schedule today we're going to have my

489
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:04,430
servers are that good but it helps if
there's a public outcry the CEO

490
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:17,990
something about this new is destroyed
and he texted to say that so there's

491
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:26,700
there's good stuff to publicity last you
need to get good web intelligence which

492
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:35,020
is like you said earlier you need people
to look at the data normal looks like so

493
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:47,030
they can fix the sound interesting to
you wanted interest where the last so we

494
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:57,360
can stay here you guys stay in this
class

495
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,190
thank you for coming and thank you for
sitting through this and being brave and

496
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,020
stoppard individuals thank you
