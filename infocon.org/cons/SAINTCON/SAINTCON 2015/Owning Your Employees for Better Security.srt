1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:27,860
talking about your employees for better
security is going to Intel's social

2
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,430
engineering fishing essentially building
your own program and I'll walk you

3
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,860
through what we went through and we'll
go from there to my name is Jake shrader

4
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:46,510
I go by Jakes to be online and working
out hire you for about three years

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,980
structure security manager so quick
disclaimer this stock is going to read a

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,640
bit how to attack hire you

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,500
it's not that you know it's been said
that a company's greatest weaknesses

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,370
greatest vulnerability are the people as
long as we are employed people we're all

9
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,790
so you know you can take these lessons
and apply them to your own companies

10
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:19,590
when you get back home so quick 101 very
brief what is it is the psychological

11
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,840
manipulation of people into performing
actions were devoting confidential

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,430
information discovery militias could be
nothing anybody who has no that is not

13
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,740
always militias sometimes kids just want
to get what they want and they are the

14
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,280
best social engineers in the world so a
couple types of social engineering

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,760
issues which is sending emails fishing
which is trying to get information over

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,650
the phone and then meeting which is
dropping USB Drive something else where

17
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,320
others will pick them up and use them
and their many others so why do we need

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,610
to worry about this we need to worry
about it because it works you know there

19
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,950
may be one guy who notices it's a scam

20
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,380
somebody else obviously a scam

21
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,280
we all know that somebody who says
whatever you ask I'll do it just show me

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,880
where to sign but really we have
approximately 1.2 billion reasons to

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,650
worry this is an article that right just
put out I'm 750 million dollars alone

24
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,810
was lost by seven thousand companies in
the USS only to your ass between October

25
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,790
2013 and August 2015 that's less than
two years and 750 million dollars lost

26
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,930
email scams or so now I'm gonna show you
a quick example this is a real example

27
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,610
that we use when we see one of the first
calls we placed we started rolling out

28
00:02:51,610 --> 00:05:03,200
our initial social engineering

29
00:05:03,200 --> 00:06:05,210
something to worry about

30
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,719
so you know yourself in the shoes of
that person they're trying to be helpful

31
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,820
at this particular person works in our
support department so they're used to

32
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,330
getting calls every day asking what
somebody asking for help so their

33
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,200
natural inclination is to help somebody
so that's that's one example we also

34
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,570
sent out an email as part of a campaign
will come back to that in just a bit so

35
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,940
our approach we have two main approaches
we're doing this we have an insider

36
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,880
threat and we have an outsider threat
each has its own merits and both should

37
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,590
be use to be able to gauge where you fit
inside don't necessarily have to be

38
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,270
malicious they can be people who you
know over the help they can be people

39
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,729
who clicked the wrong thing for this
product we're gonna focus on the

40
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,000
outsider track which everybody knows is
this guy and when I am when I'm getting

41
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
ready to hack

42
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,600
where my my ski goggles my gas mask and
those who are mostly type on their

43
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,680
laptops with one hand while it's
paradise so that receptor in focus on

44
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,390
our recon that's going to include
passive reconnected we're going to

45
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,580
prepare attack and there were going to
attack so first is Recon two goals or

46
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,750
recon is to build the best pretext a
pretext to something or an act that

47
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,740
you're putting on this puts forward to
conceal the true purpose or objective we

48
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,860
want to try and get as much information
as we can make ourselves believable so

49
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,030
that people would give us what we ask
them to we want to make sure that we can

50
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,030
get buzzwords lingo acronyms anything
like that is going to build their

51
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,200
credibility inside of your organization
we're acting as outsiders so you know

52
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,550
it's difficult to do but you really want
to try and throw away everything that

53
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,290
you know about the organization before
you say something before you send an

54
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:13,919
email

55
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,280
make sure that it's something that you
found whether it's through a massive

56
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
recall interactive regarding next time
you do this test start over

57
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,510
so for recon go through things you want
to look at their company website job

58
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,200
listings LinkedIn social media

59
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,250
some Google dorks at it and then there
are few tools which will make your life

60
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,219
easier

61
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,780
you wanna take a lots lots of notes and
screenshots on OSX there are few

62
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,140
commands you can use to keep all this
stuff contained make it easily

63
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,839
searchable you can james screenshot
names so you can search by if you upload

64
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,450
it to Google drives or even do OCR for
his you can search inside the screen

65
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,230
shot taken you know some people have a
problem with uploading stuff to google

66
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,750
the big evil overlord

67
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,529
anyway so

68
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,959
things look for on the company's site
list of executives executive sorry the

69
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,989
power within the organization if an
executive calls somebody they're going

70
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,870
to default to doing whatever they say
they're gonna give whatever they ask for

71
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,129
you want to look at jobless figure out
which which technology to using inside

72
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,430
the organization and again

73
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,769
search for acronyms buzzwords lingo that
you can find a public-facing employee

74
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:41,389
directory or even a list of employees
especially if you find somebody that you

75
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:48,499
want a pretext it's basically came over
it so far attack we started our company

76
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:55,170
website right in the middle of our page
is viewed Emma it's a great idea to

77
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,309
request that with personal address so
you can get a template you can use later

78
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:11,589
for phishing attacks on our site has a
list of our attractive executives here

79
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:18,660
along with BIOS for each of them so when
we called we can speak with authority as

80
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,529
if you don't have to worry about
changing your voice in all of our calls

81
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,819
not once did somebody say you sound kind
of funny I use my voice which uses voice

82
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:38,000
we call this multiple people and nobody
called his own words nobody wants to

83
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,180
hear the executives right when they say
jump you ask al highway yeah so our job

84
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,300
listings this like I said we'll give you
the technologies in use

85
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,670
tell you the position interacts with
customers for example it's a support

86
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:03,610
position to say that's position takes
incoming calls from customers

87
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,140
then it will also give you information
about the culture a lot of tech

88
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,510
companies have started trying to sell
the positions they want they want to

89
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,640
attract top talent so they sell their
positions through their jobs so we

90
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,480
started looking for job postings and we
swim this link at the very bottom says

91
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,180
check out our blog so we have like we go
to the blog and this is the exact kind

92
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,560
of thing we're looking for this is the
jackpot

93
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,619
about the company and signed the company
what it's like to be hired employees you

94
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,950
can use this if they're talking about
projects that are going on if they're

95
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:52,220
talking about the building's moving it
we're talking about trade shows that the

96
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,829
team is going to do while you're here
you wanna see if their write-ups about

97
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:04,939
their employees so we've essentially hit
the jackpot how many societies network

98
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,959
admins to happen here a lot so you guys
know you know usually sysadmin network

99
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,800
admins don't get a lot of recognition
right now the guys behind the scenes

100
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,399
making it all happen this is one time
when that works in our favor

101
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,380
you don't want to be recognized publicly
for a guy like me who's looking for this

102
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,680
kind of information so as they keep
scrolling through the page I come across

103
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,699
this guy which lets me that there's a
little bit of slander stuff going on

104
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:44,969
here is my second favorite pastime my
favorite pastime but it brings up an

105
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:52,100
interesting question is it cheating to
use ourselves as the pretext that my

106
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,360
question to you guys so I'm 2010 looks
at the same kind of information

107
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,150
employee profiles job listings post by
employees found the company

108
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,660
again has a big trade show coming up
their advertising a lot of companies

109
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,000
happening to engage so it's a great
great spot for US-russian so what we're

110
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,840
on the blog we find a hashtag you nation
so naturally let's go to Twitter see

111
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,240
what we can find they're so even typing
in didn't even hit enter

112
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,570
typing in the hashtag gives me a ton of
information I see that there's a few

113
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,560
nation account I see that there are
several profiles of people who have used

114
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,400
this hashtag quite a bit so look at the
top in the nation here that gives us a

115
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,970
little bit more information on Twitter
account is pretty obvious in most cases

116
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:56,790
it also you know we click on that we go
look at the main page going back to the

117
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,449
first one we see the Careers page if we
didn't find that are ready now we know

118
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,230
who runs the Twitter page

119
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,260
these accounts are a great source of
information because if they're running

120
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,640
social media pages has a job chances are
they're very active on social media and

121
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,530
their own accounts or other accounts
they may room so we are looking at the

122
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:24,709
house looks for the same kind of pain
there if they're tweeting about you know

123
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,840
company party whatever the case may be
cross-checked those users that you find

124
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:38,630
with Instagram they may have pictures of
your your high deep and see how easy it

125
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,250
is to counterfeit your ideal match give
it to a friend

126
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,910
see how far he can get in your building
after all the paperwork expensive and

127
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,730
obviously see how far he can get in and
how you know it'll give you will give

128
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,850
you an indication of what you need to
work on and then Google hacking

129
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,019
this was initially created by John
Beilein after security noting a great

130
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,839
addition to the TV

131
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,079
lots of updates here you can search for
a content that was uploaded accidentally

132
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,349
you can search for services that have
been exposed that shouldn't be and this

133
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:23,790
is constantly updated so let's first
look at is called the harvester an

134
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,380
automated tool used to search a bunch of
different sources so we'll just look at

135
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,910
the flag source you can see this attack
be flagged up seats in the main search

136
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,630
work and then taxi will get all of the
data sources Google being Jake side

137
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,240
Twitter we use all of your search it
also do a lot of DNS delegation so you

138
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,930
get a lot of false positives as well see
this will help to clean up some of those

139
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:58,019
you can also do brute force you can try
and fight over the subdomains baby

140
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,420
aren't injects person next to you can
limit the number of searches if you'd

141
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,490
like and you can also use showed him to
try and figure out more services that

142
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,019
are running so we're also gonna feed at
the TAC s flagship export into an HTML

143
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:19,290
which is not the prettiest thing but
it's nice to come back to to look at so

144
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,550
searching google pgp being searched exit
lead and this is just searching for

145
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:35,269
people essentially people DNS records
virtual hosts and i was just going to

146
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,689
start spitting out names email addresses
as its goals through a lot of stuff that

147
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:48,019
has no relevance to hire this is stuff I
believe it's using reverse IP search I P

148
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,060
Cohen and then your IP address into
being it'll reply would be domains have

149
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,229
used that IP address in the past but
still may be using that so sometimes DNS

150
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,480
lacks what was here

151
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,010
so this will be good if you know you
want to target your attack more from a

152
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,369
customer perspective right now we'll
just search for Twitter to see what we

153
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,049
can find on there and this is going to
kick back a lot of names tweeting about

154
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:22,879
higher of you have to hire view
retweeted her view so you know we're

155
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,819
just expanding their scope here so we
can find more people more pre-tax and

156
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:33,168
more information and then the last
search will run is a LinkedIn search and

157
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:39,169
this is just going to search going down
and give us a list of names so as a as

158
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:44,410
focusing on outside attacker this has
given us a huge scope that we can use we

159
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,250
can try and get more information about
and user pre-tax within the output HTML

160
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,049
page like I said it's not pretty but
we're spinning out 791 hosts 47 virtual

161
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:04,510
hosts so I said something back at the
next the textual will look at this

162
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,100
country con Angie this is a lot like
medicine those of you who are familiar

163
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,309
with Metasploit will be very comfortable
and reading and G I'm not gonna do a

164
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:19,309
demo of it today it requires a lot of
API keys some of them were paid or not

165
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:25,860
it's a great great tool you can get more
information is stored or exactly and Mr

166
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,240
55 / regarding the next to look at is a
little bit different than the other ones

167
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,380
I just called URL crazy and what this is
going to do is make substitute

168
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,390
substitutions you pitch shifting 20 mins
trying to find different domains that

169
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,770
you could use a sufficient domains or
maybe different only in some other

170
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:56,710
people have already to set up so we will
run it just ahead of you doctor but no

171
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,990
flags and its gonna spit out a bunch of
domain names

172
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,059
that are similar to hire view along with
the IP addresses of those that are

173
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,170
legitimate that have been registered in
appointing someone else to a poll where

174
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,570
it's been registered next will run it
with the dash car slack which is not

175
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:27,189
going to do any kind of spit out the
name of domains this would be useful if

176
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,170
you're not going to register these
domains of you like to register all

177
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:36,059
these domains domain name into your spam
black so then somebody else registered

178
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:45,010
users are gonna CDs so the next next
school is very similar to call the NFC

179
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:53,220
West run through the options here to
this one can do and MX check to see if

180
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,700
the host can be used to intercept emails
will do the same thing it can also do

181
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,850
GeoIP can connect to the services for
the banners so you can try and enumerate

182
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:08,760
what services are what something means I
guess it essentially the same thing this

183
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,700
one we resolve any name wreckers name
server records or MX records that you

184
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:20,070
already created and they both stayed out
differently so I would encourage you to

185
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,830
run both of them and then like I said if
you're not going to register them into

186
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,980
your spam like this so that nobody else
can use them against you so in addition

187
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,610
to these domain strengthens specific I
should surround open enrollment time

188
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:40,750
maybe Register Company Name portal
company bonus if it's around Christmas

189
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:48,170
time if you're moving offices set up a
portal that accepts any credentials sent

190
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,620
an email that says we're allowing
employees to choose where they want to

191
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,949
sit in new office employees will just
call log in page like everything then

192
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,760
send it to a demi page that says an
error has occurred

193
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,170
trying leader will try again

194
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:10,850
will try different passwords will try
later end of quarter sales guys are

195
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:16,899
going to be focused on closing business
as an attacker you want to try and get

196
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,540
people when they're most vulnerable
right you want to try and figure out how

197
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,050
to react when they're under high stress
so that once trickier to do your

198
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,120
organization requirements for your kind
words for you and then we'll focus on

199
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,219
active Rico so harmless in quotes their
hardware so you're probing for more

200
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,510
information but you're not launching
your attack now so for example this is

201
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,550
the chief operating officer trying to
get ahold of I T can you give me

202
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:55,580
something so small number given unless
you put policies in place beforehand

203
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,840
specific policies for any customer
facing public facing positions they're

204
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,770
going to give you information sometimes
even when I keep getting disconnected

205
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:13,230
from I T directly no information given
me their number or this is James and

206
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,790
sales I lost my password can you reset
it is great and I T people please don't

207
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,129
let them tell you I swear you're
kneading Beltran get more information

208
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:36,120
just it's giving me an error I can't get
on the internet I T people so now we

209
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,310
have many title phone number of the
person I T

210
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,860
we have a new title phone number of one
or more executives we may also use

211
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,780
single sign of a password manager or
else nothing will have a good feel for

212
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:57,700
the company's name and their culture
will have a pretty good insider view of

213
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,900
the company I'm going to prepare to
attack so we're going to get a pretext

214
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,779
ready to use on the phone with that
information

215
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,219
if we're gathering credentials for one
we're gonna wanna cloner login page or

216
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:15,929
click on a page that we're trying to
gather creations for and they have

217
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:21,409
permission you can always try and
compromised machines you know this is

218
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,039
this is a tricky one

219
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,908
it's a fun cleaning up after yourself
when you're done so you know I'll leave

220
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:34,340
that to you whether you see the benefit
of that cost is a big factor for a lot

221
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,849
of shops so we wanted to do our first
Arthur sweep as cheap as we could

222
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:48,269
so let's get some credit under 25 bucks
how many people here to trust caller ID

223
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:57,389
call on my phone says it's my mom it's
just I take for granted that this

224
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:02,129
computer but this is a service that we
used no affiliation with these guys got

225
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,678
spooked card you put in your destination
number you want to call and then the

226
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,820
phone number of the caller ATT you want
to display their phone works amazingly

227
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,928
well they'll give you an 800 number you
call it you put in a pin number I

228
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,159
believe the social engineering capture
the flag guys at DEFCON using service at

229
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:31,739
our call time we need a domain
certificate and something to 1700 means

230
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:39,080
she barks and barks well as long as it's
not a real word retrieval SEDAR pretty

231
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,799
cheap certificates I parks you get these
for free for trials there are water

232
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,539
services much encrypt gonna start
offering certificate so this is cheap

233
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,489
it's optional but if you're going
together credentials you need you don't

234
00:24:55,489 --> 00:25:01,070
want your credentials slowing tripped
over the wire and then we used to Google

235
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:08,039
Apps they have a 30 day trial for domain
don't believe they require a credit card

236
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,379
up front and they have great
walk-throughs to set up your MX records

237
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,130
you can also as a speaker yesterday
pointed out you can do all of this three

238
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,780
wks you can use route 53 to register
your domain you can use St yesterday and

239
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,350
emails it'll set up on the NSW so we
need some free hosting to host or chrome

240
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:33,360
website AWS is perfect for this and
there's a tea to micro instance is free

241
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,360
for a year that's plenty to run a
website together credentials so the

242
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:50,199
total cost for 995 domain name $99.99
2393 I don't know many shops and can't

243
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,620
afford 24 bucks we're just like this
then we're going to use social

244
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,409
engineering toolkit on our site

245
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,640
this at all that's incredible amazing
tool written by Dave Kennedy if you have

246
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,240
a chance to hear him speak he's a great
speaker and really one of the nicest

247
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,850
guys you'll ever meet

248
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:16,610
so we will just run this tool and it so
many driven so it's very easy to get

249
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:22,399
your we're gonna run a social
engineering attack and never gonna do a

250
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,720
website director and we're gonna grab
credentials number three the credential

251
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:34,510
harvester and I'm gonna clear sight so
for this demo I just use localhost be

252
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,300
put in the IP address the public IP
address if it's an Amazon and then you

253
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:46,180
need the url so I could in our
application and redirects that was

254
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,110
pretty good about redirecting but im
it's easier to just go to the website at

255
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,909
redirecting copy the URL see that the
social engineering toolkit and it'll say

256
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:02,390
ok we copied all your files to our / the
obsession shemale so for this demo i

257
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,120
sort of a host record but you wanna get
your DNS point to a new site and you see

258
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,860
we have a pretty good representation
over logging say we have some errors we

259
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,000
need to clean up maybe usually it's
really good so we'll go to that and

260
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,690
we'll look at the two files has index
HTML and a postdoc YouTube

261
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:26,090
index HTML is going to host its gonna
show your you went to the site you put

262
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:32,669
up this post up PHP is what does the
word anything that is posted its going

263
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:38,190
to append to this harvest your files so
that's where all your credentials so now

264
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,320
how do we get people to our site

265
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,350
well we're gonna run the attack coming
back to this email like I said I signed

266
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:50,929
up for a demo and was given a very good
template marketing and employees are

267
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:56,210
going to recognize it and then we tailor
it'll be re-registered hired you betta

268
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:03,580
calm and we welcome to people to hire
you betta we used internal buzzwords

269
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,600
like a certain size right to build
credibility we added instead an

270
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,050
incentive to clicks and we wanted him to
do it as soon as possible limited number

271
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:21,280
of gift cards were given to lucky see
you give us some feedback and the second

272
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,250
half of the email we wanted to cut down
on Groundhog I don't know if this is a

273
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,060
real term what I use that's when people
are sitting there began email their head

274
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:36,240
up as you get this this is like wildfire
to accompany this is good when you have

275
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,690
a real attack you want people to do this
this is a way since it was our first

276
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,460
test we really wanted to get a good
picture how many people independently

277
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,010
would get the email and then take action
he said keep it confidential

278
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:55,070
confidential only a few members of again
you nation credibility have been invited

279
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,600
and then if you can't login to worry
about it try again later

280
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,030
consistently being updated if it doesn't
work for you redirected default

281
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,170
application social engineering toolkit
when it gets the credentials it just

282
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,560
redirects you back to the website so
people trying to sign in again if

283
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,320
they're not paying attention to borrow
they won't know so if you can't login

284
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,830
don't raise the alarm

285
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,990
in order to cut down on Grand groundhog
syndrome as well as you want to try and

286
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,760
separated out my group right pic five
people from sales that don't see a pic

287
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,789
of you people from support a few people
from engineering and then staging

288
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:42,399
attacks that screw paintings and other
ones groupie we do next day maybe a few

289
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,889
hours later a great time to cut on cut
down on this if your gonna send it to

290
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,429
your whole employee base 6 p.m.
underwriting people will check it over

291
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:55,720
the weekend we're not gonna talk to each
other about it

292
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,870
get a lot of success so the output of
our social engineering toolkit will look

293
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:06,100
like this you can see that this CSRF
token is static that because we just

294
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,000
pulled it straight from the web page
there's something generating it per

295
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,549
session

296
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,779
you'll have a username and then you have
a password this is filled out exactly

297
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:23,260
what they take them so her stats for
attack after reset all these out 48

298
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:28,908
percent of the people that were emailed
gave us legitimate credentials that's

299
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:34,220
almost half of the people that we sent
you gave us credentials sixty-two

300
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,080
percent of those people who use that
password

301
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,799
in other places so we try to log into
your application works

302
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,870
email work try something else maybe work
maybe didn't so shut your answers how

303
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,489
many times do you think one person
committed

304
00:30:53,490 --> 00:31:00,860
predictions answer

305
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:14,260
312 time this guy wanted this $50 gift
card this was an automated we would see

306
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,710
looking through the Apache likes we
would see a lot in the Cayman 501 502

307
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:27,960
507 508 30 I saw Firefox Chrome Safari
this guy was trying everything trying to

308
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,690
get that gift

309
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:34,780
and here he is good morning I saw the
note at the bottom of the invitation

310
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,899
about trying later if I'm redirected
during the login process I've tried to

311
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,150
login several pounds since I got the
invitation to check it out right not

312
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,550
been successful and perhaps I'm doing
something wrong you know if anyone else

313
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,980
has been able to login any helpful tips
are appreciated I'm excited to take a

314
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,050
look and give feedback first mistake
just replying to the second mistake

315
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:02,990
using the email address I put in to
replace the helpful tips that I gave

316
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,600
backward well we're trying to fix the
back end up indication system so maybe

317
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,149
try ourselves for this one of guys who
didn't reuse passwords trying to

318
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:19,840
yourself that doesn't work try email
immediately more more credentials that

319
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,080
were valid credentials but I really like
this guy I personally like the new UI

320
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,330
looks way different now than it used to

321
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,070
great work now I can come pick up my
gift card to save you a trip to my desk

322
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,189
the companies on this guy right there is
no new UI there's nothing its such as

323
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:43,280
you write over gotta give props for
trying so what about voice since this is

324
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,090
our picking up a phone calling people
sometimes we salute our caller ID e

325
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,780
sometimes we didn't ninety-two percent
success rate over the phone

326
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,620
this means that out of every twelve
people we call eleven people gave us

327
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,870
valid credentials

328
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:09,939
obviously we have we had some stuff to
work right this is so how do we fix this

329
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,530
problem might be cast advice is to just
do this

330
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,540
our results doing social engineering
during fishing and having overall

331
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,899
security awareness has gone up using
this more than anything else we tried

332
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,500
quite a few things when people get owned
it becomes first become something they

333
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,330
remembered me know what it feels like

334
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,260
compromised but you're doing it in an
environment where you can go and you can

335
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:45,690
train them nothing malicious is gonna
happen but still violation of getting

336
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,690
your accounts

337
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,060
people remember that you're not going to
like it at first you're not going to be

338
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,690
elected member of the company offers but
really you know it's it's for their own

339
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:06,360
good it's that little poke comes before
it the nation reward people to people

340
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,279
who raised the alarm make it fun for
those people reward the people are shady

341
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,080
down over the phone but people who got
her gift cards for the people who we

342
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,080
have one engineer who was sitting at his
computer somebody came and told him

343
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,569
about it for him email he said its
research to set up and said we're under

344
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,710
attack and the whole engineering team
just started trying to figure out what

345
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,650
was going on that's the guy that gets
you want to publicly acknowledge and

346
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:40,410
recognize so this is an email but we got
legitimate email superficially your

347
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,409
controller

348
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:47,319
former CFO saying I need you to send us
money right away goto GNA notify me once

349
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:55,640
completed there's some rest expert said
decent recent fishing this to Utah see

350
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,490
so those of you who are in the group may
recognize it

351
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:07,750
you know he even used the gallery finds
it's a pretty good team but he stopped

352
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:15,800
so the crib story shoes not everybody
stops a lot of people exactly so we

353
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,180
brought him out from the company and I
made the short form I see PowerView

354
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:27,799
96,000 $370 per day for stopping the
targeted cyber attack but his name on

355
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,330
the back

356
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,290
1968 we call them up in a company
meeting and presented this moment

357
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:39,220
this is a good way to bring other people
into your company's information security

358
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,089
goals make them a part of his team
rewarding we do get work when they stop

359
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:48,700
these threats and it also serves to
educate other people about what's health

360
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,230
care what's coming to complement these
forward to training and retraining is

361
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,190
good

362
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,330
personalized training is better though
it's infinitely more effective when used

363
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,049
training for your company and so you're
going to do you handle specific type of

364
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,720
data train them around that data if you
are hypocrites lines train them rather

365
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,200
just go buy some training check the box
say ok we're done it checks the box

366
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:24,629
that's about it doesn't provide much
real value so open your doors to your to

367
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,380
your fellow co-workers you know which
would be better to have a guy come to

368
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:38,260
you several times a week saying hey is
this is this every time

369
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,690
yes yes looks good and this one isn't I
would argue that that's better trying

370
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,950
train them every time you say ok well
here at the red flags miss one that make

371
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,730
it so it's not having them when they
told you that you know these are the red

372
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:59,280
flags are spotted what do you think it's
infinitely better to be slightly annoyed

373
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,530
with people checking and it is for
somebody just be like Oh because of

374
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:10,510
juror can go talk to him escape quickly
and then companies in fact they really

375
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,890
need to be prepared this is another good
one that we've got there's no dress like

376
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,109
a cure is really good I got the subpoena
my mailbox today saying that I've been

377
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,380
sued sorry but I don't even know what
this is catching a scanned copy let me

378
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:30,420
know if this is pretty good pretty good
especially this one right here our CFO

379
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,360
jumped on board narrative he loves
message that these guys will set up a

380
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,940
site that is linked to a dot there is
nothing we just want to see where

381
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,700
they're coming from

382
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:51,279
in reply and say ok here is your sole
support for your use their words so I

383
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,650
can get other people on the team so many
a really bad you can almost hear the

384
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,369
accent I want you to process a wire
transfer to a beneficiary who are we

385
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,160
meeting with signs today to let me know
if you're in so I can provide you with

386
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,410
the basic information like this you know
it's easy to figure out what it's not

387
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,799
good

388
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:20,820
this one's tricky this is an email that
we sent out because we want to try to

389
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,990
knock you later people against the same
tricks that bad guys are going to use

390
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,509
you gotta keep H R in the loop when you
when you send emails like this there may

391
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:38,570
be small but the bad guys are gonna do
it we need to try and do it to you for

392
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,260
those who can't read from the back says
your spouse's found on Ashley Madison

393
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,599
resent this out shortly after news broke
of data breach some of them are just

394
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:57,030
obviously thinks DocuSign up here
dockside caps dockside in lower case

395
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:04,490
obviously I like to think this is one of
the more plausible this was highly

396
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,868
successful but again it was our first
attempt to stay relevant and current

397
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:18,720
streak from straights are gonna hate you
click here to get free tickets are worse

398
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,098
yeah but always be asking yourself as
you see current events as you see things

399
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,160
coming up on the news how can I explain
how can I try to think like one of the

400
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,580
bad guys how can I use that to trick
people so let's make one more phone call

401
00:39:36,580 --> 00:41:21,690
this guy is one of the guys to get extra
$50 gift card

402
00:41:21,690 --> 00:42:08,400
this is a losing battle and that's the
guy you want to recognize the pretext

403
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,610
use it as a couple of things it forces
you to be creative forces you to come up

404
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:17,720
with something original something
different next it also shows multiple

405
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:24,859
examples of what people can expect
answering not fun and that's all I have

406
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:35,870
so any any questions or anything we at
the time of this attack we had about 180

407
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:43,950
so still small ish

408
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:59,730
questions we've done several attacks
this one was over a few days we've done

409
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,470
some that have been over the weekend
we've done some that have been few calls

410
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,970
a day for a week

411
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:12,509
retailer reach each different engagement
we we tryin paper with the information

412
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:22,930
working with with the content were
trying to get out

413
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:34,319
we did it completely separate from the
company's so we used nothing too tight

414
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,558
ass with together with our company was
completely separate accounts offered AWS

415
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:50,010
scams

416
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,620
question so the question was what was
the result of the second time and

417
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:02,440
subsequent times the drop was very sharp
after differs a lot of the employees

418
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,120
have to talk to me about this said you
know this is more to this than anything

419
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,440
else shows in our results were talking
from a 46% 48% quick rate down 26

420
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,800
percent to 7 percent phone it's almost
impossible to get anybody disclose any

421
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,520
information or something you know just
seemingly innocuous we just don't get

422
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,770
that information so it stayed pretty
consistent between four to six percent

423
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:38,970
and it makes it very easy to pick out
the people who maybe are getting maybe

424
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:44,120
they need additional training and then
to you know you can bring the email over

425
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,839
to the desk and say ok here the red
flags here's what we put in there to try

426
00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:03,080
and shoot you here's what you can spot
we tell them so everybody gets a

427
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,830
non-working training where we talk about
the data that we are processing what our

428
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,509
position is helping crossfire data what
their responsibilities is and then we

429
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:18,660
tell every person within the first six
months you will be targeted and after

430
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,850
that it's fair game we tell everybody to
look forward to this because we want

431
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,710
them to be aware it's hindsight see
where they say they pick up the phone

432
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:35,280
and it's like ok well as this just hired
you as is with little bit attack great

433
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,900
question

434
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:53,819
any other questions so shortly after the
Sony acts where they lost you know they

435
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:59,880
lost everything right obviously the
share price may be tainted you sense it

436
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,970
was right after that when they hadn't
really discussed what caused it

437
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,078
the CTO company's office and said what
do you think is our biggest weakness and

438
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,200
people people's the biggest weakness
even so I said I have to do to fix it

439
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,589
here's my idea I think it's pretty easy
especially if you can tell them you know

440
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:23,990
this is gonna take three four hours my
dave is gonna cost less than 50 bucks

441
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:31,368
and it's going to help protect you gonna
help protect her Dana I think that's the

442
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:40,609
best way to manage without their support
and they're gonna be everybody is

443
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:42,259
hesitant with something like this

444
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:47,970
think about well what if I employees
upset us what if everybody starts going

445
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:56,058
to teach our website what happens if the
gentleman person uses this then that's

446
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:57,099
that's the least of your worries
