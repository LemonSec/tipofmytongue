53
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:29,289

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,520
happen hasn't happened in my life

59
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,909
awesome up until that point the only
opportunity or knowledge that had about

60
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,750
to them is a charity event which is
called cast for kids that's a special

61
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,120
trip and you would take out special
needs kids and their parents parents

62
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
their loved ones and it would become the
first time they've done and done

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,620
something you would donate your time and
both of us were taken up and I remember

64
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,150
one year I took out a kid who seemed
pretty normal to me he was artistic well

65
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:35,229
for me I had a son diagnosed with autism
and that was the right answer I had a

66
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,400
change the job

67
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,289
top priority right so I was working with
support by day

68
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:51,020
moonlighting as a pro fisherman my
weekend starts tonight and it's working

69
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,349
out for me I didn't know if I could keep
focusing so I heard what do the passions

70
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,270
i love u security but I can never get a
good and I heard there was a job

71
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:09,750
security and I was told there would be a
red state border with my job so I ended

72
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,960
up in Kansas City with a company that
hired me on I got to be full-time and

73
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,380
part-time security guy and i got to do
nothing but full-time security and while

74
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,190
I was working security while I was
working security that kinda was

75
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:35,880
interesting because I found out I found
out that she has a lot of similarities

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,090
of my similarities with him for a second
and being a security analyst and you can

77
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,710
read this is how nice weekend of a sec
rose don't don't think too hard about

78
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,219
how your entire existence

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,880
so so you might be saying are you
serious

80
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:06,310
let me say this is a lower and if anyone
knows the name of the slower I will hook

81
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:16,080
you up with the best way this law is
named moxie and is anyone who Moxie

82
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,560
Marlins bikers yeah this is Mark C
marlin fishing and clearly he loves to

83
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,790
fish the censored image of him coming
over efficient ways but actually I took

84
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,219
us on the rails their way sorry about
that but I'll get serious let's go back

85
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:39,270
to how they're similar yet different
Christine a lot of analysis InfoSec a

86
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,799
lot of announces right let's start with
training this is one of the ways that

87
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:51,740
they're similar to enhance training or
hope to go to a sense during their

88
00:08:51,740 --> 00:09:00,680
managers like five what I'm sorry 6001
this is me a chance training this year

89
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,130
I'm gonna take my GRE test here pretty
soon reverse engineer our fingers

90
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:16,460
crossed this is the sands of 15 the
University write a paper to come in at

91
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:24,110
each other techniques just likes ants vs
things you do for training as you need

92
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:38,250
to get those serious analysis research
research is something that is something

93
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,630
that really in a lot of ways can be
taught you kind of have an actor you

94
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,439
don't you look at things and you analyze
it or you don't know what do you see

95
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,970
their butts for some of us and many of
us researchers also Google their best

96
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,380
friend

97
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,040
yes this is the same françois some
research we're gonna look at map some of

98
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,650
you may have a soccer some you may have
some software that lets you take a look

99
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,120
at some math and science teachers to be
traffic with 17 traffic and are

100
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,300
analyzing this as a fisherman this is a
map and you can download or purchase

101
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,930
that's gonna tell you different areas
that may be good for you do your

102
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,229
research going to get those masks and
Steve what's going on but nothing beats

103
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,520
time on the water

104
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,750
nothing beats time on the water when it
comes to research and announced and the

105
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,270
same for any of you that have been
security on us for a while you'll

106
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,520
probably see when you get a new guy he's
super anxious it's just really trying to

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,250
teach students need to be in the
trenches with fishing you can spend all

108
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,300
time you want

109
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,370
researching doing everything in me but
I'm in a lot of people saying what's the

110
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,190
story announces this is the obligatory
Star Wars analysis lied at the trial

111
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:03,920
because its initial search right one
thing that goes do you spend a lot of

112
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,099
time looking at data lexus but we need
some contacts with some situational

113
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,270
awareness of what are we looking at in
15 same deal you can look at data like

114
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,090
this maybe you've learned that you gonna
go on a lake or stream reservoir and

115
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,150
hear some of the areas you could go to
but we need to learn hey this is fall

116
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,810
and winter there's gonna be a little bit
different

117
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,520
here's some data comes in this may be
something you get handed from a managers

118
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,270
as a I was given this some division some
other universities other maybe the FBI

119
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,990
drop in and and you need context
awareness is this follows its winter

120
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:46,270
week what's going on here as you know
this is not something you may use a

121
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:52,640
friend out of 66 server output you wanna
know that is afterwards

122
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,439
here's another one about a stream so you
like two streams will fight for general

123
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
use a different area some of the

124
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,960
awareness you the big picture analysts

125
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,800
they need to understand the big picture
20 photos some very famous in Europe as

126
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,390
they love the carpet and you come to a
small surface of the Internet in the

127
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:25,840
internet never lies but I understand the
big picture you need to understand

128
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:34,590
perspectives the perspective what's the
what's the big picture here clearly this

129
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:43,400
user's desktop has some serious problems
I do miss my body so those are some

130
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,660
serious to a virus on a browser reindeer
the big picture for professionals

131
00:12:50,660 --> 00:13:05,120
stopper cattle the bad guys it's all
about the similarities are shiny shiny

132
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,280
things have been sold or are being told
that you need a shower

133
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,439
protect you some bad guys right
fishermen are sold or told anyone

134
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:29,650
anything like this to build a custom fit
shut up and take my money managers alike

135
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:37,959
by that shiny new similarity right
sometimes things are developed with

136
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,500
their lures work technology to catch us
about guys so it's no coincidence there

137
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,010
was a company until the murder that
finalize the summer called what they

138
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:58,700
tell me what the logos for each right I
know it's a stretch

139
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,010
K

140
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:10,100
analyst InfoSec people they love points
here are some point you're looking at

141
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,040
this stuff and this is somebody who's
working on something happen on the 17th

142
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,880
of February changed activity on the 18th
career as a graph from somewhere

143
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,040
technology risk analytics and you can
see the different points throughout the

144
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:38,469
various points they made me pay for this
program to tell the point he was kind of

145
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:53,710
obvious point features anyone have a
great I wish I had only delivered here

146
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,580
you know I have t-shirts with everybody
wants to get a shirt from st. Thomas you

147
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:06,750
guys weren't like that judgment the same
thing I liked about him on Monday seemed

148
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,980
to try different things look good naked
in fish naked I don't think you could

149
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,450
find much more similar to write so what
does this tell me what this would

150
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,100
represent

151
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:34,139
patterns patterns are very important for
security and not based on your network

152
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,240
see patterns that are consistent or
patterns are changing can be hard to

153
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,089
find out about things are going on and
all the good things are normal for

154
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,839
fishermen same thing you gotta know
patterns best looking at a bank what's

155
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,399
the pattern the pattern has emerged
trees the pattern across from the event

156
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,329
is the pattern a point off to the side
there you never know but let's go back

157
00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:00,569
to our truck we persist and it suggests
education that's the pattern going on at

158
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:06,110
I'm here is a pattern for some of you
may have to look to logs anyone see the

159
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:12,360
pattern here you might be too sore back
but it is clearly a pattern here

160
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:27,389
workforce mobility

161
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:37,089
stickers are huge in our interview we
were talking about the seven days you

162
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,380
might be a time on Antiques Roadshow or
something's gonna show some stickers I

163
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,230
got it from somewhere original desk on
golfers exciting talk about how much to

164
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:52,139
insure those stickers for these
decisions differs from a guy from alaska

165
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:59,870
upset about some things are happening to
one of his fishing waters the photos

166
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,970
have this is wrapped an interest in
joint panel covering stickers are

167
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,970
important for both industries

168
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,750
excellent

169
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,500
closed above the involvement here this
was a tough one to get an image store so

170
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,240
I had to put this in your the first
person out of all the toxic given at

171
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,940
least not that the HTC Desire there you
have to have desire you have a passion

172
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,500
for what you're doing to be good out to
try and make a profession out of it and

173
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,890
you have to have desire and costs and
weak because the studio now the problem

174
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,150
when you're researching in putting
together this kind of talk when you go

175
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,919
to Google start looking for images
desire it doesn't end well I did you see

176
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,470
my Google profile right now especially
when you start looking for desire and

177
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,640
fishing or desire for sex aren't fishing
get your stuff like this

178
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:13,950
dr Hilary things and I got this
literally I found on the same page is

179
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:25,070
for there to be a shot ever text and
then this was serving this is disturbing

180
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,309
I don't know what's going on on the
other side of the pond but don't let

181
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:35,460
that once and for all three goes I don't
know if anybody knows what rule 34 is

182
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:51,080
but that may qualify so organize your
closet and it may be a rat's nest and so

183
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,590
you know you need to be organized you
may have that guy who freaks out because

184
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,399
it's pretty organized fishermen to do
you anticipate you super serious about

185
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,850
it is gonna have a talk about it is
going to be just in the right place

186
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,620
going here right very organized so you
may have gone to a common sure you

187
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,428
mention it back on here with a bag like
this super organized you're ready to go

188
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,220
its York on bug out bag right

189
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:23,179
reminds us what his garage looks like
love oxes organizing label crazy not

190
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:31,220
speak both districts that's why we have
things like organized for a code I found

191
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,510
something issue 2 with all that
craziness that happens for fishermen

192
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,730
when they get there going like this all
depends how many of you have a coworker

193
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,880
that has this many tabs open all the
time as well but I'm still visible as my

194
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,200
sister my sister yesterday let me go
back I just thought it was funny that I

195
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,360
was looking for meems about to meet
outside open and I had a little trouble

196
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,049
and then the results of the current at
odds over not sure where the sound is

197
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,870
coming from right when you get on that

198
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:09,809
recover and also for YouTube videos are
going to one's house for fishermen this

199
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,549
is a typical Dexter NIT tournament
literally these guys have twenty rods in

200
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:20,460
the books I usually have a dozen rods 10
to 15 so whenever you see a dozen rods

201
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,320
ready to go

202
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,760
why because you never know what I need
to go grab some women using its

203
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,360
substrate ago all these rocks are tied
on for a specific purpose there's a

204
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,860
reason they're they're

205
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,158
article a good resolution is very
methodical what they do in the

206
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,049
preparation of a good enforce a crow
very methodical and the way they

207
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:50,570
approach things but documenting
everything ok they keep out a real

208
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:59,129
schools home at 670 gonna hang out on
their patients most fishermen of a

209
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,909
patient has to be sometimes I can go
hours of them about it if you want to

210
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,980
catch the bad guy you will find out soon
going on in your network sometimes you

211
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,960
gotta be patient only to go crazy yet to
be able to adapt and also the industry's

212
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,000
adaptability is keep you never know
what's going on with the weather the

213
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,470
water change next day it could be
flooded out

214
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:27,710
you gotta be able to down because you
may have to work on a Mac Linux box when

215
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,200
those ten you may have to go back and
work on it when it was nine and never

216
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,240
know what you'll find it curious both of
these industries curiosity is pretty

217
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,470
much a necessity

218
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,080
serious about it you're really not gonna
enjoy your job and that would be awesome

219
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,439
explaining this to me first I've always
thought it'd be fun to do something you

220
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,630
shouldn't assume like a whole but I
really love the kid down he's like the

221
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,280
only one other thought of going to be
doing here right addresses likes of you

222
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:13,830
and what is in a giant bombers / who are
proficient in like myself

223
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,210
drive-by upon like this when you see
something like this may be driving out

224
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,340
through the countryside and I wonder
what kind of fish with their right to

225
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,590
secure is this going to find out what
benefits though there are some of you

226
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,668
may get a new product like this and
you're going to see some netload editors

227
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,860
and within your gonna be very curious as
to what are creating all of those gray

228
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:40,949
bars what screen the points you have a
curious ticket it's your brain another

229
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,330
point which is nice town of requests by
the link for DNS traffic so this is the

230
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,830
amount of letters in a DNS trap well
look at the norm there between 31419

231
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,470
interesting but from 41 to 49 when will
those are strong 13 Dec 25 and what

232
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:07,990
those are serious this is from one of
our products risk analytics very curious

233
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,179
I can't help to talk about this giant
point on the 18th of September there

234
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,900
it's the initial infection was a box
mint control of a call up to it and you

235
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,540
can see every day when they come back
into work are coming up

236
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,590
during business hours of things coming
home

237
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:33,990
help them resolve the incident and boom
trucks 03 September trucks going

238
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,880
jurisons understandable to work if you
could help them find it because find out

239
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:49,300
why in the world do this film wow where
do you want to dig into that this is

240
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,520
funny business as I'm doing this talk
with research for the sake of doubt that

241
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,830
there's actually a thing called school
fishing and if you're curious you're

242
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,990
gonna get up I'm not joking with you the
UK and here in the united states they

243
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,680
actually tied to some mind putting on a
stick and they just respond roles like

244
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,330
it's the right thing and the cuts on
taking Yahoo do write this paper doesn't

245
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,570
apply here because drinking crowd but
most conferences has been drinking crowd

246
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,490
so coolers are using a series of schools
are you know that all parties on people

247
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,820
and maybe some of the bigger console get
us because it was poking fun at the cost

248
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,389
of his coolers you know a lot of these
sponsors some of these fishing events

249
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,140
and you know here we go

250
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,620
challenge challenge issued a challenge
accepted right when you get a cooler

251
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,169
sponsors for the next major cause I
think so

252
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,870
mistakes will happen in both industries
as a fisherman you can make a lot of

253
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:59,129
mistakes like these guys as an initial
step bro you're gonna make mistakes that

254
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,389
and you wish you never did it may cost
you your job and

255
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:09,869
and I don't get fat man this is clearly
something happened

256
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:15,539
mistakes made by Sony their culture how
they found out about this but there was

257
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,589
a company in the industry that made a
huge mistake by trying to point us

258
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:26,299
inside they made a mistake he went on TV
talk about it and they kind of did you

259
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:31,070
get worse this is a cameraman on one of
the shows you make a mistake you got to

260
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:39,389
close allies filming ended up gettin cup
double hooks in his arm that's the only

261
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:45,869
mistake you wanna make some calls this a
mistake as yours truly

262
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:52,369
which is obligatory just unlocked and
the person that did that to me so it

263
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,570
wasn't it was hard right now to get a
lot of crazy looks on the way home the

264
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,399
people next to me did not want to take
my photo in the plane is going to stink

265
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:08,369
but again just one time I did however
make it a message I put the Autism

266
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,019
Speaks along the back there I put my
son's name on the side seams with

267
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:25,009
appropriate right so you may retain bro
how to do things going on and on and on

268
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:28,369
well I'm gonna happen gonna make it fun
we're gonna go and how do they get to

269
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:35,708
this how do I get to a minute compared
you know this scene within your company

270
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:44,969
logo on it so last year's desk on tight
end up going and I'm inspired go ahead

271
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:51,229
and submit to talk idea for a local
competition we have through one of our

272
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:56,419
guys have you tell stuck out here we
have a headset casey Cumz we meet and so

273
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,429
they had to deal with it would accept
talks about 15 minutes and you showed

274
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,549
how you have some advice and how to be
like damn what you're saying we should

275
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,799
be minutes but was your deducted points
all these things so I'm like ok I gotta

276
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,570
talk idea

277
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:18,009
I'm gonna submit to such cases that's so
sick AC they accept a Chromebook sasser

278
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:24,399
just for effective pics after I got the
same talking military besides fixing the

279
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,549
economy talk at the wall of sheep area
and then I'm here so it's turned into

280
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:34,408
this amazing opportunity for me to talk
about what does this mean and then also

281
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:40,080
what led to in fact there's a goon if
you're familiar with us Khan who love my

282
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,210
talk so much like it locally after dusk
on that you gave me one of the best dude

283
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:54,460
I was a fun talking shit got one of
these sluts in order to me how to do it

284
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:00,500
well I wanted to cut my sis finder this
is a Lowrance fishfinder one of the

285
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:08,559
original fathers day so the idea I got
was when they go into detail this is

286
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,960
another one

287
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,659
the kind I'm gonna give you kind of a
little bit of study group this is an old

288
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:17,669
people gradually receipt rolls up
through cutting-edge like last year

289
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:24,570
cutting edge but here's the AP a big
dropping it happens once again we go

290
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,178
back to ground me and in my opinion no
similarities the things that are

291
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:27,710
important

292
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:34,450
charging so you may have a soft skin
grafting shows you the activities going

293
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,230
on we come back to build and build a
says kiss traditional sonar goodbye and

294
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,840
this is why I thought about how can my
device and there are gigantic units like

295
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,720
this because a lot of money but they run
an incredible stuff okay this is the

296
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,139
kind of how could they put out this kind
of detail was side imaging great to see

297
00:28:55,139 --> 00:29:04,269
less than reasonable given some more
stuff here so you can see some of the

298
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:12,879
other side hurts me 60 here you can see
suspects garden on some of the details

299
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:18,678
pretty amazing compared to the old David
imaging or that a program right here you

300
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,460
coulda side-by-side shot at somebody

301
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,620
though some of these units put up you
know this and they can't tell if that is

302
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:35,739
their cards right here these units have
helped solve a lot of cold case this is

303
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,360
actually something that happened in
March just such a guy in my local found

304
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,209
this car at a local reservoir and it was
a cold case from the seventies and they

305
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:54,140
drove his car up out of the blue sky
forever but nowhere to Scripture so

306
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,870
these units are doing a lot of crazy
things right right now the sonar

307
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,699
technology what they've done is they've
adopted some of the other stuff that

308
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,600
would find you know people who actually
put a dog he's done to make its defined

309
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,980
it easier but that was about it and some
not so this is a higher and technologies

310
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,620
not put into this acceptable cost ensure
this Parliament 30,000 $200,000 now you

311
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:24,760
can pick it up for me so this requires a
lot of networking this is actually one

312
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,920
of these boats look like stealing
internet I'll get into some of that so

313
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:38,160
this is a device that allows the unit
like here on the table to connect over

314
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,650
WiFi so this is a wireless access point
for its members and says we're coming up

315
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,100
with a lifeline for starters

316
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:59,530
so this is the proprietor using a cable
this joker costs 60 bucks and I had a

317
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:06,780
cut in half to depart sunday and has a
proprietary and because it's gonna be

318
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,990
waterproof and for those of you
interested in this I had to put this in

319
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:19,210
because some technical stuff that uses
just 22 para here and I found out why

320
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,220
it's a little more expensive proprietary
notice the fact that they can get away

321
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,390
with charging extended anywhere else but
it's a shielded cable shielded

322
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:35,290
is the pin out for now not up to the
research I've built my cable looks like

323
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:41,010
now add to these if you want to build a
new stuff I can come back after a member

324
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,870
you'll tp-link so you may have the home
you can add this to your boat and make

325
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:54,449
it an access point just had a gross so
back to you yesterday was the first

326
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,960
thing I think of when I get the access
point for 10 months ago with his things

327
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,900
doing right

328
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:23,390
standouts you go right who can guess
what the username and password right

329
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,440
that's where in you don't really give
you this documentation so you get in you

330
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,160
can find online just looked up and saw
this as well as I can say is going to

331
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,170
some of the information it's an invite
its wits software on a you know all your

332
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,140
information

333
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,010
the operation mode as can be a bridge or
gateway some of your settings look

334
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:52,610
there's a passphrase society oh maybe
you can do that but are you to get that

335
00:32:52,610 --> 00:33:00,209
every one of these units as a bouncer
listen on speaker clearly initially we

336
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,010
all know that from our routers are cable
modems but what is the key here on a

337
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,640
password to point out one of the issues
there even if you couldn't see the upper

338
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:19,620
and numbers not very complex so did our
social engineer my way onto Abu my

339
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,570
buddies fishing boat into the store
crack open all of them look at him to

340
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:29,610
exclusion zone right christopher Elliott
was a password is probably how to obtain

341
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:36,149
a passport in no way was I want to see
what you get this season the Bulls

342
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,100
curious about that I mean what

343
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,709
why despite as fishermen stay in that
gave over what is he saying that point

344
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,309
how many of you have been fishing and
your other fishing you see both I camped

345
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:55,490
out on a point and you want to feel the
same pain you like fish what's below the

346
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,830
right well we're gonna do so to come
ashore not my talk I was going to do

347
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,740
with this from senegal through some
slides in about this so I love you I

348
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,280
hope of ever have tested the way to dump
ok so you can jump a WiFi signals author

349
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,480
user don't and when you don't you're
gonna go ahead gravity can see or hear

350
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,909
is go free wi-fi 5983 all of them follow
that same standard the MAC address in

351
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,139
with 593 so every one of the goals three
signals go through wifi and the last

352
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,240
word I'm gonna go dumped out and get it
through these are the things you

353
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,199
shouldn't be doing someone else but I
have permission because that's why unit

354
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,469
and I'm gonna send the Oscars I want to
get the handshake when I get the

355
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,638
handshake I'm gonna do in their crack
and when I crack it bloomed kids found

356
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:53,350
the key to my wife i'm in a mood for
some new Yorkers take it where was I was

357
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,680
lol sheep and this is not good because a
tough time I could not do much for

358
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:06,839
giving the tact but there's something
about it this is in store for us in the

359
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,940
Android store and you get to surrender
and you can now take your phone

360
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:21,430
some other device and you can hook up to
the wifi of your go for unit and you can

361
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,060
see what's going on so much as we're
having here

362
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,660
imagine if you have the ability to use
your iPad is looking to do

363
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,109
tablets maybe you converted a fishing
pole like this you're out there fishing

364
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:42,009
next to god you're wondering what's on
that point once again well what's below

365
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,280
his screen or instead of work driving
you did it

366
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,990
sonar driving you draw around the lake

367
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:56,368
collected all of those sort of sending
deals packets and you got a bunch of

368
00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:10,080
stuff that you can crack after the fire
so exciting ideas I started running some

369
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,270
networks nothing to see what's going on
here what would you tell me I found out

370
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:27,710
there's a thing here called GStreamer
and its streaming server 192 168 0 to 10

371
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,850
on here for now the screamer

372
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:37,618
well the unit itself was your keys to
the actual unit so then IMF unit will

373
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,940
look at all the stuff that's open and
again we have a party what's the port

374
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:50,150
8080 is the ability to download aus are
filed or upload your so far who hears

375
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:59,320
familiar with the Lowrance USR file I'm
going to educate you everyone of the

376
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,780
Richmond her in a tournament at a major
Passavant bass likes to tell everybody

377
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:10,400
who follows them a your favorite engler
Boyd Duckett she's here because we have

378
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,850
every person in the boat is a tracker so
has the information about the user and

379
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,540
worth a go on the lake details were
there are some crazy fanatic fan and you

380
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:25,250
want to know what's on their stuff you
just go uses but you can see what's on a

381
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,830
display right I showed you just have to
soften up to what he wanted to do more

382
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:40,000
what if you figured out the ultimate
issue with these units we points away

383
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,950
points 1 Way points to determine whether
waypoints officially honor their big

384
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,540
deal

385
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:53,920
kind of a big deal and unexplained 18
points if they're taken would be like

386
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,920
taking Moxie Marlins bikes could reap if
you like taking this guy's recipe book

387
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:12,660
the things that make them who they are
if so was it because of the unexplained

388
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,410
withdrawal to set up to go through a fun
little demo here i mean time I need to

389
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:25,920
begin this jack because I'm gonna show
you a little commercial Linux servers

390
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:38,190
goes of my life before forcing it was a
TV commercial axe on the Oxygen Network

391
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:44,080
so late at night of me at the dealership
like it didn't take so let me go through

392
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,750
here and show you how you to do
something similar we can take away

393
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:53,360
points and was even have a Lowrance
fishfinder homes in many cases they

394
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:01,410
that's always been a fan of the consumer
is when I never go go in the crowd so

395
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,109
I'm hooked up to the network now I got
this against Wesleyan irregular and this

396
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:12,190
is a Gentoo unit it didn't have wifi
built-in Division Series the wifi is

397
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,090
actually part of the unit and let me
tell you what that story but wifi is on

398
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:23,040
by default so anyone who has a new ad
unit at first I thought this isn't

399
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,540
really that big a deal because you know
who's gonna buy the single life

400
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,830
well as you know has wifi so let's go

401
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:41,110
abroad so let's call it the GStreamer

402
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:56,660
work so I want you to see kind of what
I'm doing on-screen son I'm using the

403
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:06,490
pickups are you saw the GStreamer and
you can see their ago has it looks so we

404
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,839
are actually here

405
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,120
State University on us and I'm gonna
hook up my tablet which is what this is

406
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,390
built for so that people can control
their uniform their toddler and show you

407
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,290
how my tablet is working because you
should see that movie now my tablet is

408
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,150
actually and you can see over the screen
as well on the corner working know I can

409
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:37,920
hit pages charged like that right so ill
talk two pages and I'm gonna my settings

410
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,060
and I want to go to for example my
wireless is just such a simple touches

411
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:53,040
that you want anybody's both worked on
and you can see what's going on

412
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,100
communicating with him so I wanna make
it 3-1 make sure you work in the

413
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,830
manufacture and I'm not going to review
of any kind of crazy 0 days of problems

414
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:09,020
that are major issues with this vaccine
troops under security because of some

415
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,110
sort of a known about where you can see
they say to improved security

416
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:20,090
you should change the default which we
know is that right so that you can tell

417
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,950
you that what they don't tell you on the
unit and we're discussing the future of

418
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,470
us have been really good we've had an
open dialogue they don't come in and say

419
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,740
that's right here you have another key
to me that should pop up something and

420
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,839
say hey you should change your default
key right because the network it comes

421
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,350
with it

422
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:53,700
on the unit itself but also not very
complex as you can see so so so so let's

423
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:02,210
go back to zoom out a bit and you can
see I know no one except for the shrimp

424
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:10,080
for the monkey fishermen fish in salt
lake in the Great Khali let's use it for

425
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,319
demonstration purposes for now because
its closest body water so I'm sooo now

426
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:33,550
show me you did you see disgrace already
there so that I could take it slow rants

427
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:39,570
the website here so I got in i download
of the USSR Fox what I wanted to do

428
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,810
something even more various militias

429
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:49,640
frank you can upload your source for all
right but i wanna blow my own your

430
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:59,910
source or sources so close yet so far
I'll fishing hotspots who is not gonna

431
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:07,960
wanna after forcing us so we're gonna
open it and we're gonna see a minute now

432
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,280
let's see what happens

433
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,330
news user data file has been uploaded to
the local device do you want to import

434
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:24,650
the file to see hot spots days I mean
what you gonna do you gonna be well

435
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:31,980
enough to figure out what is so where do
i click Yes

436
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:39,940
what is going on what's going on

437
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:50,610
seek on what is the same car right so
what you can do to convince them you can

438
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,020
put advertisements you can put sink on
you can put anyone so not just taking

439
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,960
files but you can get them to upload and
do other things now it's not the crazy

440
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,780
this is how to join 0 day but it gives
you the idea that there's a price of a

441
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,670
super powerful me going to some of the
details of it is because we are running

442
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:25,130
short on time so so so the devices and
run a few key something you can really

443
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:32,160
mess with Texas what's going on they
have the ability to contact home if you

444
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,370
took it to a network connection

445
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,480
this is an actual screen shot from the
device which is why you still because it

446
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,680
determines my demo but we're going to
build his own so what happened with a

447
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,430
device like you could do some animal
life we talked about you could spook

448
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:59,790
secretary of your source file that would
be just right maybe a few miles are so

449
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,180
maybe you could message union some way I
could upload some of the kind of file

450
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,970
that would be a WSR that maybe could
take advantage of some code the

451
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:13,209
streaming content we can see care that
the type of server it is the GStreamer

452
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,140
ok

453
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:23,870
GStreamer another two years to some you
were curious about the tone right here

454
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,920
if you look this thing is so noisy if
you hook onto the network and running

455
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,850
jump on it you can see that over here on
the side it eventually dumps its

456
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:44,390
information and says hi I'm ago three
such-and-such here's my text right here

457
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:50,879
is the VIN for the units their Linux
devices that's super powerful

458
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,070
the next gen is very powerful because it
renders 3d

459
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:02,080
has busybox busybox

460
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:09,680
the virginia has 1222 I wanted to know
what kind it was so there's a lot of

461
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,250
similarities to Slackware you contact
them and when we had a really good open

462
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,850
dialogue of service at first I thought I
get a letter from the lawyer was cooler

463
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:24,779
dry corporation every onyx and they've
been really cool they told me a little

464
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,870
bit more about this I won't go into
detail but it is somewhat nervous like

465
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:32,790
where they created their own little unit
I was worried about this what licensee

466
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:39,320
when you guys are really using some open
source stuff and they will gladly give

467
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,990
it to you if you want to discuss
something on the unit can you tell me

468
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:50,859
what's wrong with this photo editors of
routine nos it's usually possible here

469
00:46:50,860 --> 00:47:00,170
we did did John the Ripper anyone see
how long it took to get away

470
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:10,600
6917 site less than a second and we know
that the password is talking about it I

471
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,200
talked about how beacons home while the
questions I submitted soon and what is

472
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,149
higher see that this weekend's home and
i cant turn it off I can send it to 24

473
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,300
hours but I can't turn it off so can you
tell me what it sends when it becomes

474
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,240
home once it eventually connects to
public view this is send anonymous just

475
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,089
a cool metadata right kind of a big what
are you trying to it

476
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:41,650
and they said yeah it does and they
disclose it really cool about it but

477
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,540
this was after disclosing I'm not gonna
be really good in fact kudos to them

478
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,470
they may be a validator which is
basically a beta tester they ask me you

479
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,959
know what you like to do about it was
looking up stuff that's really what I

480
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,050
want to do they run some of these
products so if you're doing something

481
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,710
like this

482
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,380
surely you work with computers don't
give the rest of us a bad name

483
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:09,610
so some of you may be sitting here
saying stupid in the world's hottest guy

484
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:15,270
even give an opportunity to be on the
stage was submitted by a fishing is a

485
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,800
stupid because these are not just
devices anymore

486
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,410
these devices have a lot of capabilities
are very powerful devices

487
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,200
there's a cure your cold all pilot this
is what scared me before I talked to you

488
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,370
can't control the whole ship and when I
say ship there are ships that use this

489
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:40,390
now I did talk to them about me said
when you are on a tablet and the sliding

490
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,379
good until about a month ago we disable
the ability to use auto-pilot from a

491
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:53,250
from a tablet computer was like ok what
really hard to bypass it so it's like

492
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,020
this

493
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,009
ships like this may be just like this
have some units that take advantage of

494
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:05,340
this technology we don't want something
like this to happen the Navy house lots

495
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,900
of drones the military has drawn
sweetness a drone navy ship was a drone

496
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:15,160
we all know about this is a very famous
incident where $27 conceded R us'

497
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:26,589
military families so that you thought
the default HTM I need to go and put our

498
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:32,770
vehicles you can get this is like a
donut or now they're building in Davis

499
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:39,380
made news this is an instant
cutting-edge you guys took our airplanes

500
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,190
made some big news

501
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:48,440
this guy was a floodplain sideways
because it took another network plans

502
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,310
like this

503
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:54,500
smaller planes from you such things
company local tour of Garmin this is one

504
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:59,670
of their ups that's the exact same thing
that I just stumbled you can see what's

505
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,260
going on

506
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,880
possibly control here's an actual show
off of their software is it making it

507
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,700
should be clear brand make you curious
to be like what can go wrong

508
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:17,529
regular this gentleman had that same
thought the very famous story diabetic

509
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,550
insulin pump is like I wonder how this
works

510
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:26,020
the company tried to sue him and
shutting down because he disclosed that

511
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,089
it has huge liabilities that could kill
people so we can take it over but we too

512
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:34,210
much insulin could cause from what he's
wearing one of those of course is gonna

513
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:40,609
go so thankfully he talked about the
company which are shutting down many to

514
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:44,839
have these on your house is now there's
a big push by rocking out power to do it

515
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:50,440
or not they finally put amandime tell us
when they get a bill today by the way

516
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,690
we've updated so you may have this on me
your house you know so many people

517
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:05,890
coming up on us know when you buy
certain products in Amazon's recommended

518
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,140
as well

519
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:15,779
wi-fi enabled it learns burns what you
like to mess with it I don't know what

520
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:22,690
the reason I did the stock because what
it did to me I want you I need you we

521
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:28,650
need you to tinker and to happen we need
you to take care and happy to come

522
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,750
across as I could sneak away excited
because there's a lot of Internet of

523
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,530
Things out there and it's going to be
the next frontier remember how bring

524
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,770
your own device is a big straightening
still has a big straightening

525
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:45,599
now imagine all the refrigerators
microwaves or other devices are brought

526
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,450
in your school systems they're only seen
as computers throughout the world

527
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,078
just

528
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,029
it's like using the printer exploit your
network you gotta think what can I do

529
00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:01,339
many things I need you to have to
Pakistan about things need to happen

530
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,839
used to think what could I do what can
this device caused that could be an

531
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:13,339
issue I need you to hockey never good to
great talk by Karen she had talked of

532
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:17,200
hackers of the internet's immune system
they're finding a drug offense a great

533
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,379
deal contact us sure right now there's a
lot of issues around the world where

534
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:29,369
it's illegal to do what I did I could be
thrown in jail just a mess with this to

535
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:35,630
try to shut that down so no creativity
allow this is a problem there there is

536
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:44,339
hope and what do I say no because animal
sex or similar this great offer saying

537
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:50,880
grace burns always in the heart of
fishermen and I say hope burns always in

538
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,809
the heart of interesting because you
don't have that hope faith love what

539
00:52:55,809 --> 00:53:01,420
you're doing is gonna help why are you
doing so that's inspiring so I want you

540
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:07,549
to use your brains to be problem solvers
I don't trust words across options I

541
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:11,009
wanna see you in a context here with
some kind of crazy talk about how you

542
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:12,979
have your toaster

543
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:19,038
hi Daddy summer whatever but I want you
to have to learn anything so good and do

544
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,890
if the good work as many factors working
people make things better and the engine

545
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:29,509
of change change so thank you very much
for your time of course are you coming

546
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:37,089
out talk and i wanna think people thats
me how I was following me if you will

547
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:43,160
tell me that people so many questions
anything but everyone

548
00:53:43,160 --> 00:54:05,819
question anything nobody sleeping

549
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:15,759
for right now they leave the industry
and some of the stuff they do they have

550
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:20,729
wifi built-in that you can take some
other manufacturers and do something

551
00:54:20,729 --> 00:54:25,118
somewhat how that yet but they will
because they all follow each other that

552
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,949
side imaging was developed by another
company or a sexy I used to use that

553
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:34,619
technology so they have it right now the
ransom it was awesome 3d rendering will

554
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:38,400
actually render everything around your
boat and show you in a 3d image looks

555
