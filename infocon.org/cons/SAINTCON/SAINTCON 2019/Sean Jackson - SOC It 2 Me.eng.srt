1
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:23,240
okay let us begin we are two minutes

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:27,039
over and one thing I hate most a lot of

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,778
things is cons that get off-track

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,440
okay this talk is called socket to me

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,570
this is about sock to Atta stations my

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,718
name is Sean Jackson on twitter my

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,760

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,149
and you are not on twitter you're doing

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,149
it wrong

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:54,050

14
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:09,020
everyone should raise your hand okay

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,630
starting out a little bit up me I'm a

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,330
senior engineer at solution reach we're

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,100
a company that does patient messaging if

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,510
you make an appoint with your doctor we

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,570
send you the text message to remind you

20
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:24,590
I also own my own company Alliance

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,960
information security where I do

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,010
consulting I do pen testing where I'll

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,320
help you write your policies or I'll

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,000
help you get ready for your sock audit

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,839
but I won't do the audit I'll tell you

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,480
why in a little bit I'm a father I'm a

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,220
husband I play piano I play the organ I

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,930
play the bass I have eight didgeridoos

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,760
and I'd like to cook food and I feel

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,500
like I am enough of authority I've

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,420
experienced enough impostor syndrome I

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,230
could probably write a book on it but I

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,040
don't think anyone want to read it

34
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:59,810
because it won't be very good because

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:02,270
impostor syndrome right okay we're going

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,370
to talk about certificates and these are

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,580
not your certificates this is not your

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,979
jeep in your G cih your sis your C eh

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,930
your OSAP it's not your certificate its

40
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:17,000
certificates for your enterprise why do

41
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,400
we get certs for ourselves they give us

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,080
more credibility why do you get a cert

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,660
free enterprise more credibility

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,010
we'll talk about sock Atta stations what

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,680
they cover what trust service principles

46
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,980
are covered in different sock pata

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,180
stations the details of what needs to be

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:43,019
covered and why we should do this and my

49
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,400
favorite part how to deal with security

50
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,120
questionnaires how many of you guys have

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,430
to fill out security questionnaires

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,390
those are the worst and does anyone ever

53
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,250
read them no actually I had one customer

54
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,760
last week contact us they actually did

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,620
read it

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,679
and generate more questions and I was

57
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,900
excited by that I like they were there

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,730
other certifications hopefully this text

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,320
is not too small as thing by the way in

60
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:15,160
this to smile is so 2700 zero to seven

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,690
zero zero 1 2013 that's from the

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,740
international standards organization

63
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,060
this is a global sort of certificate and

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,630
this is all about your information

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,170
security management system this is

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:33,540
really your marching orders of how to do

67
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:37,420
security the way they check it is a

68
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:42,850
process model it's not really a binary

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,619
yes-or-no there's also NIST 853 that is

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,790
from the National Institute of Standards

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,910
and Technology so it is government okay

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:56,140
let's back up this is the security

73
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,290
framework and this is control compliance

74
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,170
based it's a bunch of check boxes yes or

75
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,320
no are you doing it it's not how are you

76
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,839
doing it but are you doing it and then

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:13,209
I'm in healthcare I don't if anyone else

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:17,340
is here but hi Trust is for healthcare

79
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:19,959
and that is a kind of a binary of things

80
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,380
they are they're difficult and it cost a

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,840
lot sock to has about 80 to 100 controls

82
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,600
depending on your organization how you

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,929
accomplish the things high trust has

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,229
about 400 those 400 are checked against

85
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,220
5 levels of maturity so that means your

86
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,740
auditor has

87
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,930
roughly two thousand two points to audit

88
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,530
that takes a lot of time and it costs a

89
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:48,490
lot of money high trust is actually like

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:55,840
a hybrid of this keeps turning off and

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:59,860
back on weird it's like ISO 27001 mixed

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,869
with NIST kind of a hybrid and it gets

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,660
its name from a health information trust

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,670
alliance alright but we're talking about

95
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:18,130
socks different kinds of sock reports

96
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:21,630
there's a sock one and that is what is

97
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,630
going on like it's all dead

98
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:41,560
I see dead screen I see dead screen and

99
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:47,620
I have a spinning beach ball all right

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:50,409
we'll ad-lib the sock one is all about

101
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,900
financial it is system and organization

102
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,900
controls for service organizations I see

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,589
F R which stands for internal control or

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,878
financial reporting this is not

105
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:03,099
something that most of us are gonna deal

106
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,279
with is financial reporting so think of

107
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,810
your bank and think of someone who's

108
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:15,430
doing finances maybe your accounting

109
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:19,110
department but not us and I'm going to

110
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,110
unplug that so I can get my mouse back

111
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,060
try again

112
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:52,230
oh look I see it over there

113
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:56,190
I apologize technical stuff is the worst

114
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,190
to the sideways in the talk

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,650
let's try again

116
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,499
if it was live hacking me it's awesome

117
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,080
you see that

118
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,870
did Pope do something to this cable he's

119
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,869
we could talk about hacking speakers I

120
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:39,549
rebooted because it was dead like Pope's

121
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:43,659
done something you can't shown your hand

122
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:45,790
we ever talk about it right your bar my

123
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,170
cable you guys know that Pope does a V

124
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,699
he's got to talk about hacking speakers

125
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,699
by giving you the cables

126
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,530
good hog this is so far back

127
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,270
okay let's go again okay the sock to

128
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,240
system and organization controls for

129
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,550
service organization trust Services

130
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,230
criteria this is our bread and butter

131
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,150
this is what where's what we do our day

132
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,600
jobs right anyone here does not

133
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:41,600
information security okay this is this

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,080
is our bread and butter also there's a

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,020
new one called sock three and what's

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,940
that this is a system and organization

137
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,670
control for service organizations trust

138
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:57,700
Services criteria for general use report

139
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,260
I think of this as like sock to jr. I

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,790
know I think is just another product

141
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,170
where they're trying to make money I

142
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,189
don't see the value of this when you

143
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,709
have a sock to a real sock - there's

144
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,680
different types of sock shoes there's a

145
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,960
sock - type 1 which means an auditor

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,819
comes in and looks at your stuff and

147
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,710
says for everything I looked at it's all

148
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,080
good all their Ducks are in a row and

149
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,540
it's all secure and they're good so

150
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,520
here's my stamp of approval I'm gonna

151
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,240
give him a type one it looked good while

152
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,600
I was there

153
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,260
type 2 is when they go back and they

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,210
audit all the data for the last year and

155
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,950
they say not only was it good when I was

156
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:45,860
there they were good the whole year so

157
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,620
that is really valuable when you're

158
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,460
giving it your sock - type - to a

159
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,440
potential customer or a partner this

160
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,090
says not only did we have it when the

161
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,620
order was there but they went back and

162
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,460
they checked and we had it every single

163
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,140
day the whole time or most of the days

164
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:10,130
or we fixed it when they were there yeah

165
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,720
your audit has to be done by a CPA so

166
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,960
most of us are not going to leverage

167
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,030
your career into becoming a sock Auditor

168
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,410
it's gotta be a CPA who has enough

169
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:23,000
training to ascertain whether your

170
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,370
efforts to secure things is good enough

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,980
so that some good training there can be

172
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,420
a CPA probably has a cyst so they got

173
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,690
some homework to do it's an attestation

174
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,349
not a certification

175
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,060
there's a difference with the NIST 853

176
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,700
you're gonna get a certification yes

177
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,540
you've checked all those boxes this is a

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,710
letter that the auditor writes and this

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,370
is a letter that you'll give to your

180
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,630
customers that says in their opinion

181
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,380
you're doing a good job securing

182
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,070
everything it's not a check box it's a

183
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,180
letter

184
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,470
and so this is not so much a code or a

185
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,779
framework and I'm trying to tie back to

186
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,600
a joke from mooie it's more like a

187
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,870
guideline why am i saying it's a

188
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,130
guideline the auditor must remain

189
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,770
independent for management

190
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,460
responsibilities they kind of define how

191
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,439
you do it

192
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,890
they can only assess your efforts meet

193
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,210
the requirement so you may have heard

194
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,740
with a sock audit you can decide what's

195
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,690
gonna be tested it's not so much what's

196
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,600
gonna be tested you decide how you're

197
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,380
going to secure the things how are you

198
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,430
going to make sure availability is there

199
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,150
how are you going to make sure the

200
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,120
privacy is is protected you define how

201
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:47,260
you do it they see if you're doing

202
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,480
enough does that make sense any

203
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:54,010
questions so far so the trust service

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,680
principles that are covered in a sock

205
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,450
audit they can cover security they can

206
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,150
cover availability they can do

207
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:05,529
processing integrity confidentiality or

208
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:08,680
privacy but every single one has to have

209
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,779
security so you'll have security and

210
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,260
availability or security and privacy or

211
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,140
security and confidentiality or security

212
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,920
availability and privacy or availability

213
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,260
and confidentiality or all five each one

214
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:29,050
of these is going to add cost to the

215
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:31,839
audit so my recommendation is get your

216
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:35,199
security your baseline and when the

217
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,650
right customer asks for the next trust

218
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,709
principle then you add that and if you

219
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,810
have a sock to type to say you've been

220
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:45,699
even audited for three years now

221
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,550
you had the type one you had a type two

222
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,500
and a type two

223
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,180
so you've had your ducks in a row for

224
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,170
three years now and then they want to

225
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,979
add privacy that becomes a security type

226
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:01,160
2 and privacy type 1 next year after

227
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,529
that security and privacy type 2 does

228
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,569
that make sense the first time was all

229
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:08,209
it will always be type 1 do that for a

230
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,800
whole year then it becomes type 2 and so

231
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,630
eventually if you're gonna add all you

232
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,579
could have security availability and

233
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:20,899
privacy type to confidentiality type 1

234
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:24,560
next year they all are type 2 what's

235
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,000
covered your sock if you're doing just

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,768
security and I'm going to from now we'll

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,570
talk just about security you're

238
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:35,839
recovering oversight of the organization

239
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:38,120
vendor management programs so vendors

240
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,220
are third parties internal corporate

241
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,920
governance risk management processes and

242
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,220
regulatory oversight it's pretty high

243
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,110
level now let's get a little bit deeper

244
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,760
and I'll show you what it is the

245
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:59,390
auditors are looking for and this is I

246
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,040
hate saying the same things are on the

247
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,750
screen but with this kind of Jiraiya

248
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,439
material there's no way around it and so

249
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,730
I'm just gonna show you what the

250
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,720
auditors are looking at we'll talk about

251
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,640
it management and personnel demonstrate

252
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,880
a commitment to integrity and ethical

253
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,939
values they're gonna check how are you

254
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,420
doing against that well what are they

255
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,550
talking about here how would you confirm

256
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,899
or show that management and personnel

257
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:31,750
demonstrate a commitment to integrity

258
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:34,130
and ethical values blinky blinky

259
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,510
seriously this one's going up and down

260
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,560
over and over and over and over and over

261
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:42,100
as long as you know a background check

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,250
right a background check

263
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,649
do they have criminal backgrounds do

264
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,899
they a problem with substance abuse do

265
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:56,120
they have outstanding huge outstanding

266
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,140
debt that's what they're looking for so

267
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,930
when the order comes in they're gonna

268
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,439
say do you do background checks do you

269
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,410
repeat

270
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,279
is there a vetting process when someone

271
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,660
is hired that's what they're looking for

272
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,310
that's the kind of this is exactly the

273
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,110
kind of thing the auditor has to assess

274
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:16,099
are you towing the line properly

275
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,209
management and personnel demonstrated

276
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,850
commitment to integrity and ethical

277
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,750
values the Board of Directors

278
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,670
demonstrates independence from

279
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,750
management and exercises oversight of

280
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,519
the development and performance of

281
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:30,769
internal control what does that mean

282
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,230
well the Board of Directors if there is

283
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,680
one they don't work there that's not

284
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,170
their day job and there is management

285
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,069
structure in the company independent of

286
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,449
the Board of Directors management

287
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,979
establishes with broad oversight

288
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,790
structures reporting lines and

289
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,930
appropriate authorities and

290
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,680
responsibilities in pursuit of

291
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:56,388
objectives what does that mean you've

292
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,638
got a CEO and you have your CFO and your

293
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,769
CEO oh and underneath them they have VPS

294
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,839
and anything they have managers under

295
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:07,819
them they have team leads there's a

296
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:12,829
structure hiring a reporting structure

297
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:16,428
so different levels reporting lines so

298
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,369
the auditors gonna say show me your

299
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:21,709
company organization is it broken out

300
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:24,799
enough that responsibilities are broken

301
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:29,600
up that there's no no no it's not easy

302
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,918
to have collusion or problems management

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,959
demonstrates a commitment to attract

304
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:38,030
develop and retain competent individuals

305
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:41,929
with objectives you post on your job

306
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,360
listing requirements job requirements

307
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,820
and skills needed and then when people

308
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,539
come in you you check that you do

309
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,950
evaluations management holds individuals

310
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,879
accountable for their internal control

311
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,570
responsibilities in the pursuit of

312
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,159
objectives what does that mean the

313
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,129
auditors gonna say what happens this one

314
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,710
violates a policy what are the teeth

315
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,940
behind the policy and remember a policy

316
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:10,330
with no consequences is not a policy

317
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,330
it's an idea

318
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,740
communication information obtained

319
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,090
generates and uses relevant quality

320
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,190
information to support the functioning

321
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,889
of material control they're gonna ask

322
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,380
how do you know that what you're you're

323
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:26,080
testing for is current what are the

324
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,140
current vulnerabilities how do you know

325
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,189
whether your Volvo something or not

326
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,420
communicates information internally

327
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,590
including objectives and

328
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,790
responsibilities for internal control

329
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,290
necessary to support the functioning

330
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,970
internal control what could that be

331
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,610
they might ask what's your ticketing

332
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,630
system how do you notify the ops team to

333
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,850
go patch something how do you do

334
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,890
security awareness training how often

335
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:54,429
you do it who's invited do they sign

336
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,690
something communicates with external

337
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,290
parties regarding matters affecting

338
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:01,570
function even internal control they're

339
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:05,010
gonna ask how do you let customers know

340
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,919
when you're changing the application or

341
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,450
to whom do you report a data breach and

342
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,160
how do you do it how do you communicate

343
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:17,350
with authorities these there's still

344
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,180
more but this is the thing these are the

345
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,020
things that the auditor needs to assess

346
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,240
this is what has to be met and they

347
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,320
don't tell you how to do it they're

348
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:32,620
gonna ask you how are you doing that and

349
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,970
is that enough so these are actual

350
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,850
things the auditors have to know so if

351
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,200
you're looking at getting a sock audit

352
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,939
think about these things and how you're

353
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,110
doing in your environment if you're not

354
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,050
if you don't think you're doing it well

355
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,929
enough on Monday we get back to work

356
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:50,250
talk about this we need to improve this

357
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:53,680
before we pay the audit to come in

358
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,180
control activities this is so the

359
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,980
company that I've used and not this is

360
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,440
not a sponsorship but I've used Linford

361
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,780
and company and they are the best

362
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,920
otters I've ever worked with in my life

363
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,660
they set up a relationship with my

364
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,550
organization for three years they're

365
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,300
gonna do our audits data are type 1

366
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,710
they'll do a type to another type 2 and

367
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,730
I asked them about these control

368
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:19,600
activities control activities are your

369
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:22,180
policies and how you control things as

370
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,399
policies so I said what does this mean

371
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,840
selects and develops control activities

372
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
that contributed to the mitigation of

373
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,590
risks to the achievement of objectives -

374
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,750
except for levels this whole thing is

375
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,199
they call this this they told me this is

376
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,610
the self licking lollipop this is this

377
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,690
whole section on control activities do

378
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:46,240
you have policies about policies it's

379
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:49,210
kind of circular logic but you select

380
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,690
and develop control activities you have

381
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:58,170
policies that determine physical

382
00:20:52,690 --> 00:21:02,830
security access management inventory

383
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:04,809
baseline configuration password

384
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,210
complexity all these different kind of

385
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,410
policies you can have the organization

386
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,309
selects and develops internal controls

387
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,840
selects and develops general control

388
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,340
activities over technology to support

389
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,520
the achievement objectives so you have

390
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,570
policies about technology patching

391
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:31,809
cycles baseline configuration wiping

392
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:32,980
stuff BYOD policies deploys control

393
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:34,210
activities through policies that

394
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,500
establish what is expected and

395
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,950
procedures that puts policies into

396
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,690
action the self licking a lollipop

397
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,600
do you have policies about policies

398
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,360
about policies about policies monitoring

399
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,370
and systems operations and any selects

400
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,479
develops reforms ongoing and or separate

401
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,040
evaluations they have a pen test the

402
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,750
entity evaluates and communicates

403
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,950
internal control deficiencies and timely

404
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,840
matter to those parties again ticketing

405
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,530
do you help the dev team fix the app

406
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,000
problems to meet objectives and use the

407
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,030
detection of monitoring procedures to

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,200
edify changes and susceptibilities are

409
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,970
you doing scanning do you have something

410
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,110
watching network traffic are you looking

411
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,429
at logs if so what are you using how are

412
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,340
you doing it are you doing this

413
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,020
appropriately are you doing it enough

414
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,250
they monitor system components and

415
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,800
operation of those components for

416
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,220
anomalies or indicative malicious acts

417
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:36,450
do you have an IDs do you have a

418
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,450
firewall do you have a sim

419
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,639
the entity evaluates security events to

420
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,049
determine whether they could or have

421
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:47,879
resulted in failure or the entity to

422
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:50,340
meet its objectives evaluates security

423
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:53,178
events so what are you looking at logs

424
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,918
with went there when there's something

425
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:59,009
in your system if you're using security

426
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,690
onion are you getting emails if you're

427
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,590
using Splunk and here we configure

428
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,769
properly are you getting text messages

429
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,769
when something is is critical can I see

430
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:10,590
the text message good check you've done

431
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:11,940
it the inner ear responds to identified

432
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,529
security incidents by executing a

433
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,529
defined instant response program

434
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:23,549
do you have an incident response program

435
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:25,169
if you have a team they identified

436
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:27,539
development activities to recover from

437
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,809
identified security incidents what is

438
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,100
your incident management process

439
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:37,529
show me your process show me your

440
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:39,959
documentation then just get in security

441
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,370
the process for granting modifying

442
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,230
terminating access to the platform

443
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,469
supporting infrastructure how do you

444
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,500
onboard how do you off board asset

445
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:54,120
inventory what do you have do you know

446
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,370
what you have access reviews who who has

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,340
credentials to get to this to that to

448
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,049
the other password parameters how long

449
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,029
are employees

450
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,658
passwords required to be how long our

451
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:08,700
customer passwords required to be

452
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,710
physical security maybe this is a big

453
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,419
thing maybe it's not but what are you

454
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,000
doing for physical security how do you

455
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,460
know if here your secure data

456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,279
transmission security is everything

457
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:24,029
encrypted in transit is it at rest if

458
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:27,360
it's not why not can you justify it data

459
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:30,600
encryption at rest usually endpoint

460
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,939
security this is going to be your your

461
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,830
agents on the box

462
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,929
do you have something watching the box

463
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:44,908
as a agent based IDs production

464
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:47,429
infrastructure security how is get labs

465
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:50,869
secured who has access to that

466
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:53,719
or who has access to the data center

467
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:56,279
hardware and data disposal management

468
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:58,889
put in your policy that when something's

469
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,839
retired you wipe it who wipes it don't

470
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:04,709
know but they can check who's wiping it

471
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,418
at my organization we had a problem the

472
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,799
IT department wasn't wiping as much as

473
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,710
they should have and we had her own

474
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,359
machine that was sold to an employee

475
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,190
call home for a patch while the otter

476
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,509
was sitting there like something popped

477
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,299
up and I said oh we don't have this

478
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:21,419
device anymore and I said you just said

479
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:24,049
that right from the auditor so now the

480
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:27,029
security team has two white machines

481
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:31,830
removal media policy this one's tricky

482
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:34,499
because locking down the USB is not

483
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:38,070
really a high priority for people so you

484
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:40,950
got justify not having it and the most

485
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:44,099
painful one this is the one that at my

486
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:49,469
organization we've been doing this for

487
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:52,979
six months now and it is still painful

488
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:54,659
it's hard for the developers live with

489
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:56,929
anyone have an idea what I'm going to

490
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,929
talk about

491
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:09,570
no not administrator access separation

492
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:14,369
of duties that's right in here change

493
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:17,509
management so I don't know if any of you

494
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:21,299
guys have heard of continual development

495
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,580
that's a thing right when you tell the

496
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,450
developers they can't just build it and

497
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:33,509
push it and they're used to building and

498
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:37,049
pushing it really gets them unhappy but

499
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:38,969
what change management is change is

500
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:42,839
authorized for development that's one

501
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:46,169
person change is peer reviewed that's

502
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:49,249
another person one thing I'm missing in

503
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:52,799
there the change is developed so

504
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:57,509
authorized developed can't be the same

505
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,249
person peer reviewed can't be the same

506
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:01,270
person it's gotta be a peer it could if

507
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,650
if you have to developers and

508
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,090
I've consulted with one company they had

509
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:09,280
to there's a completely binary system

510
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,449
one guy said here's my idea we're gonna

511
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,350
sketch it out here's the architecture

512
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:17,260
design this guy had to go build it this

513
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:21,760
guy had to review it then he went back

514
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:24,850
to testing it yeah okay so at least

515
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,980
binary has to be two people you cannot

516
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,110
do this with a house of only one

517
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,790
developer in real small shops you might

518
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,350
have one developer if you're gonna hit

519
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,629
your sock on it you're gonna hire

520
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:41,790
someone because you cannot have one

521
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,790
developer why what is this stopping

522
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,450
malicious code the one guy who's gonna

523
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,990
write a backdoor so when he gets fired

524
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:55,980
he can still log in and steal stuff

525
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,540
this is stopping malicious code or a

526
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:03,160
little a little more safer mistakes

527
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,260
bad code sloppy code may be truly it's

528
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,980
protecting it's malicious code it's

529
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,480
forcing it to be at least collusion two

530
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,070
guys working together if you have a

531
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,980
larger team at work I have 50 they pass

532
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,840
around the responsibility of checking

533
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:24,160
each other's code it's usually one guy

534
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,870
generates the the authorization a couple

535
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,560
people will build a code and then

536
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,379
someone else

537
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,399
two people through the peer review at my

538
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,990
house we do to change is tested after

539
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,530
it's reviewed by two people it's tested

540
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:41,020
by someone else not the same person

541
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:43,120
change is approved for production so

542
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,700
it's been reviewed it's been tested it

543
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:52,000
passes testing now it's approved can't

544
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:55,540
be the same person if no segregation of

545
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,130
duties so if we if it's really tight you

546
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,180
need an automated notification to others

547
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,710
with responsibility for approving

548
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,030
changes so you do a pull request and

549
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,710
everyone who can do the approval they

550
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,149
get automatic notification does that

551
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,560
make sense not the same person and

552
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,250
change is validated after being

553
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,049
implemented so in a worse case and

554
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:21,830
someone has the ability to roll back

555
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:25,529
code not the same person and this is

556
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,649
painful if you're used if everyone in

557
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:30,990
all 50 developers I work with are used

558
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:33,928
to just churning through stuff and

559
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:37,950
making it work and getting it online and

560
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:40,559
making it better and the author says

561
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,570
you've got to slow down you have got to

562
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:47,549
put things in place that make it so no

563
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:50,639
one person can get bad code up it's

564
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:53,270
painful but it is so necessary because

565
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,720
this attestation is going to go to a

566
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:59,460
potential customer and say we've put

567
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,100
things in place that make sure that no

568
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:06,299
bad agent can really take us down or

569
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:09,840
take you down it's part of being a

570
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,110
mature enterprise startups this is the

571
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,870
biggest hardest step to becoming the

572
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,760
mature enterprise from being a start-up

573
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,139
and this is what I think the big

574
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,510
difference is the biggest difference

575
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,610
between a startup and enterprise is how

576
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,169
robust is your change management and

577
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:30,510
separation of duties and that's a real

578
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:34,909
soapbox but this is this is the biggest

579
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,908
point of pain in my environment so

580
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,270
evidence of separate development yes you

581
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:44,668
got to have a staging you have a

582
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,860
development and environment staging and

583
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,330
testing and then production the public

584
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,080
sees production they should not see the

585
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:55,649
other two that's what's in the sock

586
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,110
that's what has to be covered and you're

587
00:30:55,649 --> 00:31:01,408
gonna have eighty to a hundred data

588
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:04,289
points or audible points that say you're

589
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:06,120
doing all those things now the reason

590
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:09,570
I'm giving this talk is because that

591
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,918
whole list I just gave you I wanted to

592
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,750
know what there be checking and I

593
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,429
couldn't find anything anywhere that

594
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,899
says what the author is looking for and

595
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,000
so it's really it was a it was a dark

596
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:20,850
room we were looking into and I said we

597
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,139
should get our sock at a station but I

598
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,178
don't know what they're gonna ask about

599
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,520
I don't know what they're gonna check

600
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,419
for so that's why I said as soon as we

601
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,658
got it done

602
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,979
I said I'm gonna write a talk so

603
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,239
everyone else can learn that because I

604
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:35,329
didn't know what was in that dark room

605
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:38,309
I'm now shining the light in the room

606
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:42,299
that's what the auditors need to check

607
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:44,869
for so from everything we just talked

608
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:50,429
about if you don't have that at home on

609
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:52,408
Monday put this on the agenda put this

610
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:54,539
on the list we needed a better

611
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,459
background checks we need to repeat

612
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,289
background checks we need to have better

613
00:31:56,459 --> 00:32:00,179
separation of duties we need better

614
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,309
structure we more independence from the

615
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,809
board we need better physical security

616
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:08,639
we need we need to wipe machines we need

617
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,219
to have evidence web machines when we

618
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:13,678
give laptops to a third party to dispose

619
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:19,070
them we need a receipt to show that it's

620
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,070
happening you need to start creating the

621
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:27,299
it's not evidence the word it's the word

622
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:30,679
that always defines me when you go it's

623
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:34,440
like in our tech architectural dig our

624
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,829
artifacts I forget that word artifact

625
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,519
you're creating artifacts in your daily

626
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:43,739
work life that make it possible to be

627
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:50,159
audited for in order to come find those

628
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:53,549
artifacts you're really putting on the

629
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,529
big-boy enterprise pants you're coming

630
00:32:53,549 --> 00:33:02,158
from a start-up to an enterprise and

631
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:06,809
that sock to letter given to your

632
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:11,279
customers says we're software to service

633
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:13,619
but we're serious we're good we're on

634
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,879
solid ground we've been here for a long

635
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,059
time we're gonna be here for a very long

636
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:19,439
time work with us your data is good with

637
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,389
us your customers are very happy you're

638
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,289
working with us because look what we

639
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:30,809
have let's knock out it so why do we do

640
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:34,139
these Oh BAM it's attractive to

641
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:35,579
potential customers it's a good way to

642
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:37,859
get things in line when you have a slow

643
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:40,259
buy-in or attraction for security

644
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,740
initiatives if you're trying to do

645
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,640
separate

646
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,890
duties and you can't get any traction

647
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,150
bringing the sock Auditor they've

648
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,890
approved the budget for the audit

649
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,980
they're gonna spend 30 grand and the

650
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,120
auditor says have they been telling you

651
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,650
any in separation of duties and you're

652
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,860
not doing it I'll tell you the same

653
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:02,760
thing and then they have to do it it's a

654
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:06,120
good way to force their hand to listen

655
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,559
to you that's the thing everything we've

656
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,190
been talking about it's not foreign to

657
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,629
us

658
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,360
we all want these things we want to have

659
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:14,190
things more secure but we all know how

660
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,080
it does it work if it's gonna slow it

661
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,790
down as we cost more money they're not

662
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,560
gonna do it a sidenote

663
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,879
at hack West I don't know if you guys

664
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,369
know I'm kind of associate with hack

665
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,739
West we had a keynote Don Murray

666
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,300
Hutchison she said something in her

667
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,668
keynote that I've used in every

668
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:37,139
interview and I use all time people talk

669
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:41,480
about security slows us down and she

670
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,480
says why do you put brakes on a car

671
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:51,899
slows you down no you put brakes on a

672
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:55,200
car so you can go faster you put brakes

673
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,330
on the car so you can go faster because

674
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,089
you have the things in place to slow you

675
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,560
down when you need to if you didn't have

676
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:06,780
brakes you really wouldn't go very fast

677
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,520
at all we're the brakes we don't we

678
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,100
might slow it down but that's not why

679
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,830
we're here we're here to make it so the

680
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,670
committee can go faster because there's

681
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:19,410
no way to get malicious code up because

682
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,570
there's no way to get a bad actor

683
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,618
employed because there's no way to let

684
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:28,140
someone in the building is not

685
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,320
authorized all right and if you have

686
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,540
your sock - and I would say this is the

687
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,980
first certification attestation you

688
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,710
should get for your organization this is

689
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,190
the lowest bar is the easiest way into

690
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:43,410
an enterprise environment you can start

691
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,400
building your security packet which

692
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,810
would be your sock to letter maybe a

693
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,090
sanitized executive summary from your

694
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,980
last penetration test maybe it's some

695
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,090
policies your security policy your

696
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,910
incident management policy

697
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,640
maybe it's a sanitized risk assessment

698
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,140
of third-party vendors that's another

699
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,490
thing I didn't put my bullet you need to

700
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,290
do a risk assessment of third-party

701
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,540
vendors anything your data passes

702
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,670
through a third party you need to get

703
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,960
there you do risk assessment on them

704
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:15,210
quite often they'll send you a sock

705
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:20,550
report hint hint okay so why do we do

706
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:22,530
these the questionnaires at b-sides Las

707
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,870
Vegas this last year there was a great

708
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,390
talk by Katie LeDoux called

709
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,980
escape the questionnaire quagmire a

710
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,629
thoughtful approach to addressing

711
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:37,920
security inquiries from customers and

712
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:40,260
prospects basically you put this packet

713
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,500
together with your sock report if you

714
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:46,440
have it your ISO report your NIST report

715
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,050
your high trust whatever certifications

716
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,420
you have with that executive summary

717
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:54,060
from the pen test with some policies

718
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,100
with the third-party risk assessment and

719
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,650
you take it to your marketing team and

720
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:03,990
you brand it you give it all one flavor

721
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:05,370
and that's your security packet then

722
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,930
when they send you a questionnaire you

723
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:12,359
say thank you for this

724
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:15,450
go find your answers in that all right

725
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,810
no questionnaire you just hand them the

726
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:21,660
packet and tell them you can find the

727
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,360
answers because they're in there some

728
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,390
bigger customers will insist no no you

729
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,130
answer our questions then you go to the

730
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,620
salesperson say how much are they paying

731
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:36,060
for our services can they justify my

732
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:39,810
salary for a month my salary and the

733
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,509
analyst and the IT guy and the head of

734
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:46,920
development can they justify all of our

735
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:48,420
salaries for a month probably not so you

736
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,750
tell the salesperson tell them go back

737
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,100
and look in the packet and if it is big

738
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:59,970
enough you go okay fine we'll do the

739
00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:01,799
questions also this morning I did it a

740
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,870
little thing on Twitter where I said I'd

741
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,810
review my slides a little movie and I

742
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:09,640
went the click

743
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,250
like in Cat Valentine she she responded

744
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,049
and if you've heard of Cat Valentine

745
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,720
she's rock star

746
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:20,770
she wrote a blog a great blog post about

747
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,419
sock to basics and during the keynote I

748
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:25,240
was flipping through this it's a really

749
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:29,260
good article the way you find it you

750
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,810
search medium calm space cat space sock

751
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,960
- it's a really good blog post about

752
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,950
sock to basics kind of the same thing

753
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,580
I've talked about a little more detail

754
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,689
also you have her contact information

755
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,950
cat really knows her stuff with sock

756
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:47,800
audits when it's online go watch this

757
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,500
video from Katie LeDoux it was a great

758
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,000
talk and she does a really good job of

759
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,520
articulating what I'd kind of barreled

760
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:01,920
through Cat Valentine is a great blog

761
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,920
post about this are there any questions

762
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,120
with that

763
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:37,359
so the question was is the audit for a

764
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,770
type 2 the same as the type 1 yeah

765
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:47,259
rather than so with the type 1 let's say

766
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:49,420
we're talking about onboarding they

767
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,020
would say show me the show me the people

768
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,520
who are on boarded in the last month can

769
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:59,980
you show me the background report for

770
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:04,740
sample number 2 and number 5 or if

771
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:08,050
they're talking about hardware disposal

772
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:12,689
they said let me see all the Hardware

773
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:15,790
where the ticket changed from asset to

774
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,490
sold and they'd say show me that one to

775
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,750
show me that want to show me that one

776
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,990
when they come next year they're gonna

777
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:26,200
say show me the list of all the hires

778
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:30,390
all the separations all the data

779
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,589
disposals all the push tickets all

780
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,359
everything that we they check for

781
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:39,250
everything is auditable show me all of

782
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:41,230
them and then I'm going to say give me

783
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,030
those five give me those three give me

784
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,740
those two give me those seven give me

785
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,680
these ones they'll look at all those and

786
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:50,080
say that every step along the way for

787
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,609
all 12 months you did it so they're not

788
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,799
gonna check every single one they'll do

789
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:55,390
a sample from all those and then say

790
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,160
we're comfortable saying you've done

791
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:02,040
this for a whole year does that make

792
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,040
sense I don't your question what else

793
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:25,529
it goes back to the secret sauce it has

794
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,319
to do with their whoever's above you

795
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:30,299
their level of comfort sharing this

796
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,930
information about how they secure their

797
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:40,109
things I think personally a sock letter

798
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:42,058
is safe for general consumption like but

799
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:46,200
I would say put it on the homepage on

800
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:48,329
the security page but my employer

801
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,999
doesn't want to do that it's on the same

802
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:55,710
boat they want an NDA it's

803
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:59,038
understandable you're gonna be sharing

804
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,420
some secret sauce you say basically how

805
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,999
you're doing things how you security

806
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,880
things which could create a vector for

807
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:09,480
an attacker to get in in theory it makes

808
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:14,839
sense so for those with more paranoid

809
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,839
privacy minded require the NDA yeah

810
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,220
another question

811
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,940
yeah

812
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,670
I don't think so at all if you have

813
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:51,489
things in place that still secure it say

814
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:56,400
your firewall to the staging environment

815
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:58,900
allows a choice IP whitelist that IP

816
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,180
they're going to want to know I'm sorry

817
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,979
the question was we talked about earlier

818
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,660
the three develop environments the

819
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,848
development staging and production and

820
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,069
he said I said production to be only

821
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:10,479
publicly only public facing everything

822
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:13,029
else a private and he said what if we

823
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:16,210
want to do a beta test and we offer it

824
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:18,279
to some customers the auditor and this

825
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,640
is audit speak they want to know that

826
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:23,440
you've considered all your options so if

827
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,328
you consider it and you say we're gonna

828
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,920
we're gonna whitelist we're gonna punch

829
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:29,650
a hole in the firewall for this little

830
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,269
IP that from that one machine or from

831
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,239
their relocation they can get in to see

832
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,410
staging if you've done it adequate

833
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,150
protection around that it wouldn't

834
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,249
violate anything as long as you've

835
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,749
considered it and you need a thoughtful

836
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:43,868
approach to it and you did everything

837
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:45,609
you needed to secure it otherwise you're

838
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:48,249
not gonna violate anything of course I'm

839
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:50,109
not the auditor so I can't but I would

840
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:51,430
say you'd be safe if you if the auditor

841
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,259
came in and said what are you talking

842
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,759
about you give customers access to your

843
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:57,219
staging environment you say well look at

844
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:59,650
here's the access rules in the firewall

845
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:01,930
they can only come from this IP they can

846
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:07,380
only hit this IP do we put up just for

847
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:07,379
the beta test you're fine I think

848
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:14,140
exactly code to be up and maybe it

849
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:17,469
hasn't gone through testing it or maybe

850
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,779
it hasn't it it wasn't done with QA or

851
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:20,739
the app set guy didn't get his hands on

852
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:25,479
it yet and there's a vulnerability

853
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:31,259
that's live in staging so that's why you

854
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:31,259
can have separate areas another question

855
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,619
nothing okay I apologize I have ADHD and

856
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:40,869
I still speak fast I took my med this

857
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,180
morning but I still spoke fast we've got

858
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:44,859
some extra time if you want to reach me

859
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,210
again if you're not doing if you're an

860
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:51,069
InfoSec and not on Twitter you're doing

861
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:54,009
it wrong InfoSec happens on Twitter it's

862
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:55,420
when Twitter first came out the what we

863
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:57,460
call now luminaries the first guys who

864
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,099
