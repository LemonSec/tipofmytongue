1
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:17,160
all right welcome everyone to my

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,480
presentation today thanks for coming out

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,699
I know there's a lot of awesome

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,830
presentations and I'm glad you decided

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,510
to come spend some time with me today is

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,580
one man's trash is another man's home

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,650
lab which I should have done the subtext

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,659
under there that how Shawn learned had a

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,170
dumpster dive and not get caught

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,600
I like how y'all laughed at that anyway

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,180
a little bit about me first off just one

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,520
disclaimer all my slides are pretty word

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,200
heavy reason for that is I want you to

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,940
I'm gonna distribute these after vac so

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,640
you can have them I've got model numbers

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,920
prices stuff I'm using a little bit loud

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,270
sorry model numbers prices and whatnot

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,360
so don't worry about trying to take

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,860
frantic notes or anything along those

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,039
lines because I'll be distributing these

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,649
I am a UVU graduate right here from the

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,780
valley I I did what they call their

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,380
10-year plan and that's where you

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,700
basically go to school for the first bit

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,740
sorry we good so it's when you go to

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,869
school you see a new class come in and

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,048
they go through the program and graduate

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,369
and you're still going and then the next

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,369
class comes in and they go through four

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,320
years and they graduate and you're still

31
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,400
there and then after ten years you get a

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,658
bachelor's degree and it was like why

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,110
are you gonna after your doctorate no

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,189
just taking a while I'm a wire shirt bar

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,789
shark could fix you not oh I did that

36
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,990
for ten years every trace is interesting

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,189
to me so if you have an awesome one come

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,140
find me and say hey I got a goal tres4

39
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,820
I'd love to see it I have very strong

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,119
opinions about VLANs and network

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,398
segmentations so just one of my one of

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,630
my quirks if you really want to get me

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,840
talking for the better part of an hour

44
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,860
ask me should I VLAN my home network

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,689
other hobbies I'm a mountain bike

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,610
enthusiast here in the valley it's great

47
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,829
making braking tinkering I think we all

48
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,560
do that PC gaming of course a little bit

49
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,570
of podcasting not too much and I'm not a

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,079
Cylon if anyone is asking thought I'd

51
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,660
get that out right now so why do I need

52
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,160
a home lab this this question is

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,180
something that I posted with a lot of my

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,760
co-workers a lot of friends over the

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,500
years why do we even need one

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,810
and really IT workers have become the

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,819
tradesmen of the 21st century if you

58
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,620
think of times of old you'd have

59
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,390
carpenters and plumbers and electricians

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,890
they'll have those now but back in the

61
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,290
day you'd have to sharpen your tools

62
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,480
after work you couldn't go to a job site

63
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,670
with dull tools and expect to sharpen

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,518
among the customers time and it's gotten

65
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,409
more complex IT systems has gotten and

66
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,870
bigger and stronger and more connected

67
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:41,120
and and it almost seems like it's hard

68
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,220
to keep up with just our you know 8:00

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
to 5:00 9:00 to 5:00 time learning and

70
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,209
keeping up with all these new

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,440
technologies budgets are stretched a lot

72
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,239
of employers are really actually

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,970
foregoing having a tester sandbox

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,170
environment just had a question you can

75
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,840
raise your hand if you want how many

76
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,790
actually has a true sandbox at work true

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,139
not connected to anything else sandbox

78
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:06,349
that if you break it no one cares so

79
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:08,209
eight a few more okay that's awesome I'm

80
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,819
glad you have that most people don't

81
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,500
want to learn so the time kind of

82
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,450
sharpen your school skills at home has

83
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,450
arrived and that's and that's what this

84
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,589
is all about and and a lot of people say

85
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,629
well why don't you just go to trainings

86
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,879
why don't you do online courses all that

87
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,440
and those are great paying for

88
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,698
professional hands-on training is a very

89
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,099
effective method but a lot of those are

90
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,639
focused on one piece of that one piece

91
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,869
of a technology one aspect one thing and

92
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,340
a lot of times they're one and done will

93
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,599
go for a week have a great time make

94
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,609
some new friends learning about

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,690
technology

96
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,980
six months later if you haven't touched

97
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,160
it again do you remember it

98
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,840
not so much and a lot of trainings that

99
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,790
like I said are focused on short-term

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,280
memorization one-and-done pass a test

101
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,319
get it going in contrast a home lab is

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,849
your own personal environment where

103
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,589
you've built it and rebuilt and torn it

104
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,119
apart and breaking it and had the rest

105
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,349
of your people in their family yell at

106
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,659
you because the Internet's down again

107
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,629
for the eighth time because it was just

108
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:05,060
a patch it should have had a problem but

109
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:08,810
yeah here's my favorite John Wayne photo

110
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,989
you can't play in prod you can it's a

111
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,549
terrible idea but you can the path to

112
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,470
the unemployment line is paved in

113
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,530
changes that should have had any

114
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,269
problems everyone I think it knows a

115
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,768
cowboy in their organization if you

116
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,769
don't you're likely that person

117
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,160
again everyone's laughing but they're

118
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,810
like oh yeah I kind of am as complex and

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,639
connected some stuff is it's getting

120
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,680
hard to the point where you can't make

121
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,599
changes downstream um I remember I was

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
benchmarking some dis stuff and all the

123
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,169
sudden prods start to feel like I'm like

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,389
I'm isolated there's no way I'm touching

125
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,039
it well I was saturating the network

126
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,650
linked a little bit heavy and things

127
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,409
happen so I came up with the rules of

128
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,150
home lab now just a fair warning with

129
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:55,300
the rules of home lab I break every

130
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,560
single one of these on a daily basis but

131
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,180
still they're good rules and we should

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,330
probably follow them but I don't

133
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,360
you should I should do home lab stays

134
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,940
isolated do not put your family photos

135
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,030
on home lab minor on home lab right now

136
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,270
look proper clothes don't find their way

137
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,008
to home lab they will move them off you

138
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,049
should be able to break it crash it tear

139
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,150
it apart and no one cares except for

140
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,479
yourself having your production edge

141
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,909
router in your home lab bad idea we

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,068
still do and then like I said real stuff

143
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,020
you care about does not live there and a

144
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:30,759
lot of fun oh I love it I love tearing

145
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,630
apart stuff I love building up labs I

146
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,099
love finding high-value enterprise gear

147
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,979
that's been discarded and thrown away

148
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,599
and repurposing it really if you're not

149
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,830
in if you don't really find this fun

150
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,319
you're probably in the wrong seat here

151
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,169
in the bus some awesome home lab

152
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,699
projects how many have a plex server

153
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,810
yeah there's my plex users yeah that's a

154
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,460
great first project one of the first

155
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,500
thing I almost everyone does home

156
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,630
automation is getting really awesome in

157
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,550
in-home lab and the reason to me I

158
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,740
mentioned a home assistant and open have

159
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,240
these are isolated systems these are

160
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,650
systems where you actually make a choice

161
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,180
whether connectivity from the outside

162
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,549
world comes in or not a lot of the

163
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,830
off-the-shelf Samsung smartthings

164
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,650
looking at you has to be cloud connected

165
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,710
right and in a world of privacy which

166
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,409
I'm very much a part of I really want to

167
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,289
make sure that we control that and open

168
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:22,029
have or no home isn't great thing on

169
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,580
that same privacy token private cloud

170
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,449
services run your own cloud stop using

171
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,349
Google Drive or whatever onedrive

172
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,430
containerization right place to play the

173
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,759
containerization if you've never done it

174
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,070
before

175
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,509
micro segmentation I've actually got an

176
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,550
environment right now where I've got two

177
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,810
hosts on the same broadcast domain they

178
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,710
can't talk to each other

179
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,240
it's fantastic Sdn VPN private's no can

180
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,180
do t if you go to your Starbucks you go

181
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,830
to public places you could use a

182
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,120
third-party VPN service that claims they

183
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,780
don't have logs and claims they don't

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,060
get hacked

185
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,530
I have news but I would try to zero tier

186
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,180
awesome project for that if you're a

187
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,849
play to zero tier you should check it

188
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,820
out it's fantastic run your own IP

189
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,050
camera envy our system blue iris shinobi

190
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,240
there's a few others out there that are

191
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,889
super great again avoiding the cloud

192
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,210
always onto technologies with that PBX

193
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,440
if you've ever want to put a phone in

194
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,870
every room of your house and have an

195
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,419
intercom to call everyone I don't know

196
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,580
why you're weird but ok that's cool we

197
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,780
can do that and then piehole another

198
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,969
awesome thing if you want to do a whole

199
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,429
home ad blocking go and check that out

200
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,680
great place to put it in the lab so kind

201
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,810
of what makes a good home lab I've come

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,490
up with I like to call the the Trinity

203
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,440
of home lab and I made this up myself

204
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,940
and it's it I think it's pretty great

205
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,260
you have your upfront cost

206
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,969
you've got your ongoing cost which is

207
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,650
your power and you got your performance

208
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,330
and you want to balance all three of

209
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,590
those those things you to hit me on one

210
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,060
of them you're gonna have a bad time and

211
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,400
then you have to pass what I like to

212
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:56,580
call the chaff that's the cohabitant

213
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:59,859
acceptance factor yes

214
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,620
chaps can can vary from super easy I

215
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,590
mean I live by myself so if anything

216
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,060
goes to you better have it all cleaned

217
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,229
up and nice but in a closet and then

218
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,120
you're doing exhaust fans and all that

219
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,500
good stuff once you pass that chaff

220
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,680
security gate you're good to go

221
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,520
and we're doing home lab so think about

222
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,430
your chest right now

223
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,599
I'm flowers or presents or gifts or

224
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,360
build them an awesome gaming rig and

225
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,639
then you do what you want ok so again

226
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,260
very calm to heavy I'm very sorry

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,550
pick a budget and stick to it when we're

228
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,950
talking about your upfront cost and

229
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,690
buying something it's so easy to

230
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,510
nickel-and-dime yourself and I have done

231
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,309
it so many times be realistic with your

232
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,200
expectations don't go and think and

233
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,650
you're gonna get yourself 44 cores for a

234
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,560
nickel it's not gonna happen we're using

235
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,130
your home gear as a fine place to start

236
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,079
it works

237
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,700
it comes with limitations and don't

238
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,230
think to get a home lab you need to go

239
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,610
buy enterprise gear that's what I do

240
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,440
because I like it I like playing with it

241
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,920
I'm trying to mirror production as close

242
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,170
as I can but really you could take your

243
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,219
old desktop PC throw some alternative

244
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,300
software on and start learning and

245
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,040
that's great it's a good place to start

246
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,779
the one that I've bolded that you really

247
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,610
can't tell is bolded says do not force

248
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,170
yourself down an expensive path because

249
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,019
you found a good deal on a single item

250
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,279
and I'll get in that in just a moment

251
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,140
these are your main pieces right here on

252
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,329
the right side you got your compute CPU

253
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,100
RAM stick with ECC I'll get more into

254
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:21,040
that and out-of-band management is

255
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,690
fantastic for a home lab for your

256
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,069
storage you got your cache and capacity

257
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,100
tiers rent talk about that and then

258
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,839
switching we run I run ten Giga home for

259
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,839
my home lab for my server interconnects

260
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,100
not tell my desktops it can be done it

261
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,300
can be done for cheap and there are

262
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,140
options to do it I'll talk about that

263
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,420
software VMware fantastic run v san I've

264
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,319
ran visa at my house it was painful and

265
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,420
expensive but it worked

266
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,430
hyper-v can do stores bases the stores

267
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,930
basis directs pretty good have some

268
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,189
patience when you're building this don't

269
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,870
go out and saying hey after this

270
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,519
presentation it was so good thank you

271
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,290
then I went out and bought a whole new

272
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,480
home lab you will spend a lot of money

273
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,969
doing that way this is a marathon and

274
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,269
not a sprint so I'm gonna tell you a

275
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,940
cautionary tale of forcing yourself down

276
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:06,089
a very expensive path it was the summer

277
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,440
2015 let me set the scene summer 2015

278
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:13,480
Terminator Genisys had just come out

279
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,769
disappointing fans worldwide David

280
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,610
Letterman was at the end of his show and

281
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:22,390
I was browsing public surplus as one

282
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,860
does and public surplus is a great is a

283
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,170
great tool you can find a lot of stuff

284
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,430
that cities governments schools are

285
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,199
getting rid of it's it's one of the

286
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,489
resources you can also buy yourself a

287
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:35,649
box of 205 port gigabit switches I don't

288
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,910
know why you do that parenthetically

289
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,949
kids don't like those as the

290
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,980
trick-or-treating gifts I don't get it I

291
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,839
would have loved one but it's fine they

292
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,620
didn't like it but more like well what's

293
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:54,910
this I'm like it's gigabit welcome so I

294
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:58,779
found myself a dl380 gen9 was think

295
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,010
about putting one in their house yeah I

296
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,350
did

297
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,630
and this was the time I was moving from

298
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,880
more of a analytical role to a to a

299
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,350
hands-on practical role and I thought I

300
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,830
need a real server I'm gonna do this for

301
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,440
realsies

302
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,540
so as my acknowledgement server hardware

303
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,330
came I knew Zeon equals server that's

304
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,310
about as far as I got so I said hey if

305
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,970
this has to Zeon's that's got to be

306
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,000
better than anything right 220 watt TDP

307
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,700
Zeon's I might add there X 54 60s if

308
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,020
anyone's curious had an HP p 400 RAID

309
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,910
controller built in with a bloated

310
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,130
battery didn't know the dangers of that

311
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,810
first time had dual power supplies

312
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,480
because two was better than one of

313
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:41,530
course and 32 gigs of high-performance

314
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,450
ddr2 memory mm-hmm we're excited and it

315
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,980
cost him about $200 you'll see that's my

316
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,240
sticky note you see the green laser

317
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,930
through the back of it does that work oh

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,000
oh technology you can see like my

319
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,650
initial analysis of my server and my

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,810
winnings also notice I'm wearing some

321
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,720
kind of like crew socks with dad shoes I

322
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,949
don't know what that was going on but

323
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,480
and lucky for you guys I take pictures

324
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,520
of all my stupid projects you get a

325
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,740
laugh at them I mean learn from them so

326
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,110
what a smart person would have done at

327
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,760
this point this point liver said hey I

328
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,920
have a server let's get started let's

329
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,350
learn some things this is great that's

330
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,170
what a real smart person would do what a

331
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,460
moron does is he goes and buys at eight

332
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:26,829
friends yeah that's my basement of my

333
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:31,660
house with nine dl380p five because if

334
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,850
one's good nines got to be better so I

335
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,410
thought hey I've got them all of us take

336
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,760
the parts out we'll build one super

337
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,880
server it's gonna be awesome it's gonna

338
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,560
be sweet so I did it I took all the SAS

339
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,090
drives a pin mill enclosure I racked it

340
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,589
up notice you can actually still see my

341
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,980
sticky note there on top that's the same

342
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:50,800
box and I had 8 by 146 gig 10k SAS

343
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,320
drives for a whopping 11 68 gigs raw a

344
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:59,260
twenty six I forgot read six I had done

345
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:01,540
it I needed more so logically the first

346
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,819
thing to do is say hey those are two and

347
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,920
a half inch drives SATA can go into a

348
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,720
SAS backplane well why don't we just go

349
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,020
and buy ourselves much a two terabyte

350
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,220
laptop drives I don't work so I did I

351
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,779
spent 400 bucks

352
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,120
said hey

353
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,970
- these that'll be great so I got him

354
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,680
like a moron again I unwrapped them all

355
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,499
real quick put him in all my sleds

356
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,758
shoved in my server there are no

357
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:30,160
available physical drives oh the HPP 400

358
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,949
can't support a hard drive over 800 gigs

359
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,800
I just filled out a bunch of laptop

360
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:38,170
drives on a server that won't work okay

361
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,670
no keep in mind I already open the ball

362
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,248
I already put him in the sleds they're

363
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,019
not going back so what would an

364
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,180
enterprising young man do at this point

365
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:50,379
nobody do he would cut his losses and

366
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,059
try again no I'll buy me a P for 10

367
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,279
controller that supports drives that are

368
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:57,370
bigger so I bought a P for 10 on eBay

369
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,149
spent 35 or $30 on it buy it now

370
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,559
fantastic oh I didn't know RAID

371
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,309
controller just had different connectors

372
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,399
for backplanes

373
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:08,199
but that's a thing s FF 8087 what is

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,779
that I don't know well I'll just build a

375
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,439
fan-out cable I don't need to do that no

376
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,649
stinkin backplane I got a fan on cable

377
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:17,410
okay

378
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,610
well if I just did a fan-out cable why

379
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,969
am I still using these little laptop

380
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,879
drives I can just run em outside of the

381
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,170
chassis of the servitor well I don't

382
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,569
wanna have dry state around I know

383
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,550
I'll buy yet another thing which is a

384
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:34,599
hard work which is a little external

385
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,490
hard drive rate or dock with you know

386
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,259
the five drives in that have it sitting

387
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,379
outside next to the server it'll be good

388
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:45,370
that'll work so I did that and that's

389
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:49,360
what it'll bike again remember my chaff

390
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,100
is low yours might not be this low now

391
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,209
now notice there's one of those drives

392
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,389
right there that I bought remember that

393
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:58,329
ya gotta use it but after all of this

394
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:03,579
hullabaloo and all this work success I

395
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:05,500
had a drive so again I've got a serve

396
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,529
working server I should use it this will

397
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,600
be good I'll learn things no no no let's

398
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,889
rip up our my perfectly working nasod I

399
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,870
already built and put all the drives in

400
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:19,420
the server yes that's a great idea

401
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:21,730
so I did that yeah horrible idea but at

402
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,370
the end of the day I was on a mission

403
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,610
and my mission was to get ESXi running

404
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,760
with my drives all ready to go so

405
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,890
I did it you can see it there it is

406
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,330
running it's beautiful I got ten point

407
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,740
eight two terabytes variable in grade

408
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:41,890
six success I had done it seven hundred

409
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,790
and eighty two dollars later remember

410
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,550
this started with a two hundred dollar

411
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,839
like purchase from public surplus we're

412
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,219
just gonna forget the other eight

413
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,360
servers I bought happen let's just

414
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,690
forget that happening cuz that's not

415
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:58,060
include in that figure six months later

416
00:15:52,690 --> 00:16:00,460
might be four ten died yeah so on that

417
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,219
note what happens when your specialized

418
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,280
RAID controller dies can you just grab

419
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,590
your drives and shove them in a new box

420
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,589
no you can't you need another P for ten

421
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,970
so I had to literally grab my rack of

422
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,640
hard drives run over to a friend of mine

423
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,610
who had a P 410 rebuild my array and

424
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,890
then export my data back off on to large

425
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,740
format external drives which I had to

426
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,210
purchase a Best Buy that night that was

427
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,030
the gift that keeps on givin the whole

428
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,650
year it really was so you know for a

429
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,209
thousand dollars in seven months your

430
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,920
life you can have a server for seven

431
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,540
months so coming back to the Trinity

432
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,130
there's the upfront cost please learn

433
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,750
from my mistake that was a horrible I

434
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,870
actually wanted to subtitle this whole

435
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,520
talk of don't do what I do I'm dumb but

436
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,660
I didn't think they'd accept it so I

437
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,860
kept that off but I'll tell you that

438
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,410
let's talk about ongoing cost this is

439
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,900
your power calculate this as a yearly

440
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,380
cost not as a daily cost it is super

441
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,140
easy to fool yourself thinking quarter a

442
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,700
day's not too bad thirteen cents a day

443
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,250
of power is not too bad calculate on the

444
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,290
yearly just as a frame of reference 500

445
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,730
Watts running 24/7 is about four hundred

446
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,170
thirty dollars a year in Lehigh because

447
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:13,030
we don't have cured power yes my what my

448
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,380
back right now is about a kilowatt I'm

449
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,149
about a thousand miles from Iraq just in

450
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,830
case you're curious and I'm running warm

451
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:23,140
will keep your house warm in the winter

452
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:24,669
and hot in the summer putting it in your

453
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,180
romaine office where you work day to day

454
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,470
is a bad idea unless you want to go for

455
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,120
that whole sauna thing in the office

456
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,800
which more power to you I think it's

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,600
awesome

458
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,399
your increased capacity and replacement

459
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,959
is an ongoing cost your capacity tier is

460
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,250
going to grow exponentially as you start

461
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,420
getting more stuff and building more

462
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,730
projects

463
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,799
plan on component failures if you find a

464
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,390
good deal on on a component that you're

465
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,220
using and you like and it works well by

466
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,420
two of them just by two so you don't

467
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,440
have to run hat and hand over your

468
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,190
friend's house to get him to build your

469
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,840
RAID controller by a kilowatt that

470
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,280
little beauty right there take it with

471
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,659
you when you go test stuff to buy it

472
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,850
because a lot of stuff we do second hand

473
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,049
oh when I go buy a piece of hardware

474
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,490
I'll actually take my kill while plug it

475
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,070
in look at the power and be like have a

476
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,410
good day thank you so much here's ten

477
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,389
bucks are every time software's cost in

478
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,410
there give MSDN v mug we'll talk a

479
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,880
little bit about it but if you've never

480
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,130
heard of e mug Advantage program it's

481
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
fantastic it's $200 a year you pretty

482
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,090
much get everything VMware has for home

483
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,460
lab use and so that's how I ran V San

484
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,280
you an even dozen VDI horizon good stuff

485
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,110
like that I'm talking about performance

486
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,600
we're not billing prod here we're not

487
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,530
going we're not going nuts so think

488
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,230
about your workloads and plan

489
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,210
accordingly if you wanted run a bunch of

490
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,280
VMs having a single platter as a bad

491
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,559
idea trust me from experience I thought

492
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,100
ten terabyte I can fit a bunch of VMs on

493
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,320
that thing

494
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,580
Wow I'm running to and it's def focus

495
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,049
your efforts on ram capacity and you're

496
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,240
gonna hear me say that a lot ram ram ram

497
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,040
it's wonderful if you are going to do

498
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,780
spinning drives for your capacity tear

499
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,720
go ahead and get some SSDs as a cache to

500
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,340
end up so now that that's all out of the

501
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,640
way I'm sold

502
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,290
let's build it let's do it so obtaining

503
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,770
components ranked by effectiveness

504
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,480
number one end of life decommission

505
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,120
equipment from your employer if if you

506
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,150
have a if you have the employee PC

507
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,409
purchase program if you have like a a

508
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,240
garage sale type program the employer

509
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,260
works participate in that that's usually

510
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,590
the best place you'll find your best

511
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,710
deals the stuffs already been advertised

512
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,909
the taxman took his cut whatever nine

513
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,290
times out of ten little sell to you for

514
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,030
a really good cost my work does that

515
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,799
it's fantastic if you don't have one

516
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,840
talked to those in ite talk to those who

517
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,970
manage that stuff even get one set up

518
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,799
it's a fantastic way to do it please

519
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,799
just make sure that it fits the home lab

520
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,280
criteria don't run any C 7000 it's at

521
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,870
home

522
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,470
I actually know someone who is and

523
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,760
they're nuts but awesome and ensure

524
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,340
proper data destruction best back to

525
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,900
this please number two is have a guy and

526
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,428
that's pretty much the same as number

527
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,390
one it's just he's gonna take all the

528
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:54,160
good stuff first and give you the

529
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,810
leftovers still pretty good

530
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,910
I have a few guys that I use like that

531
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,530
you're getting second pickings but it's

532
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,270
it's pretty it's usually pretty

533
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,410
effective sometimes that guys just

534
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,760
better looking at EBA than you are

535
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,500
that's okay

536
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,320
number three classifieds Facebook mark

537
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,490
place eBay you do okay their Facebook

538
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,980
marketplace I don't had a lot of server

539
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,860
stuff eBay there's tons and tons and

540
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,450
tons and tons classifieds not so much

541
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,620
there's some here in the Whaley and then

542
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,940
number four is your IP right cyclers

543
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,100
these are the places like Tam's if

544
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,420
you've heard of them though this is

545
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,129
where the companies will send their

546
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,390
stuff to be destroyed and resold you're

547
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,950
gonna spend a little bit more there

548
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,380
admittedly but they kind of know what

549
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,490
they have going on so it kind of comes

550
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,050
with the territory sometimes it comes

551
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,220
with warranty I hit a switch fail after

552
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,389
I bought from one of these recyclers and

553
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,720
I had them replace it which was super

554
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,460
awesome so let's start compute and again

555
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,710
content-heavy slide I'm very sorry but

556
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,570
you'll get at these afterwards right now

557
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,950
as of 2019 right now your best bang for

558
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,990
your processor best bang for your buck

559
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,700
processors are right here in this top

560
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,360
corner if you can't see them they're the

561
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:55,630
2650 B twos if you do the L model you

562
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,580
get 10 cores 20 threads and very low

563
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,580
power usage as far as that goes you're

564
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,590
talking about 75 80 watt TDP at idle

565
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,879
they're gonna be takin about 15 20 just

566
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,709
for the processor itself and it goes up

567
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,510
from there all these processors on this

568
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,810
list go for about 50 to 80 dollars on

569
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,940
eBay and then they are on the VMware HDL

570
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,200
46.7 so you're gonna stay supported if

571
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,550
you don't care about the HDL so much

572
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,500
that's fine you can use them older stuff

573
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,030
I like to stay on that list just so I

574
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,060
don't have to deal with gremlins inside

575
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,490
my lab they use LGA 2011 motherboards

576
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,919
they can be found for about 180 for a

577
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,550
dual vertol socket generally the super

578
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,200
micros are the ones that are out there

579
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,070
they're sticking with ddr3 memory which

580
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,570
is a little bit cheaper right now

581
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,189
especially if you're going easy see I

582
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,470
haven't made the jump in the home lab

583
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,790
guides to go to a ddr4 yet just cuz it's

584
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,170
still a little bit pricey it's coming

585
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,060
down and it's coming up pretty quick but

586
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,920
it's still not quite there if you don't

587
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,050
want to do a true enterprise board you

588
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,680
can do an X 79 chipset that was the kind

589
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,750
of the workstation or enthusiast boards

590
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,300
a little bit cheaper alternative fine

591
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,190
notice right here the bottom will avoid

592
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,440
the Aliexpress motherboards they

593
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,510
actually have some x79 s on Aliexpress

594
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,250
they're about $60 here's a few problems

595
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,960
they work they do work and I've tried

596
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,720
one here's the problems

597
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,710
one all the manuals are in Chinese like

598
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,249
all of them to BIOS updates not gonna

599
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,559
happen

600
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:19,330
and three they're not making that

601
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,559
chipset anymore so it kind of makes me

602
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,960
wonder where they get them are they

603
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,330
overruns are they old stuff are they D

604
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,799
soldering recycled parts I don't know

605
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,840
you're gonna end up spending six months

606
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,749
waiting for it then be sad on Christmas

607
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,119
morning so I try to avoid it they also

608
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:35,889
sell at dual x79 board on there which I

609
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,619
found the other day which the X I mean I

610
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:40,748
never came in a duel at 79 set up I

611
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,999
don't know what black magic voodoo is

612
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:45,490
happening make that happen just avoid it

613
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,720
plug for the best when it comes to like

614
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,850
mounting this if you're doing yourself

615
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,869
you're building your own server don't do

616
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:55,178
this this is a recipe for unpleasantness

617
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:57,129
so what I did is I had a 3d printer I

618
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,379
salut and I said hey I'll just print

619
00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:01,509
some brackets and put these 7200 rpm

620
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,789
drives all nice and cozy with no airflow

621
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,990
right here down here this is where

622
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,340
they're supposed to go there's a fan on

623
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,990
and that works pretty well but right

624
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,279
here this is where the magic happened

625
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,039
fun fact

626
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:15,190
Sony turn rpm drives act really weird

627
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:18,429
when they get up to 80 Celsius really

628
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:22,269
weird you're like I swore I saved that

629
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:23,799
file and now it's gone fantastic there

630
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,240
are affordable server enclosures if

631
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,860
you're going to do something like this

632
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,799
build some fans and make something work

633
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,719
you also may SMO stop power supplies

634
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,668
that you'll get into don't have enough

635
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,659
SATA power headers for that so using

636
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,850
what I like to call Chinese fire

637
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,830
starters and that's your molex to SATA

638
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,320
splitters or your SATA 2 SATA splitters

639
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,529
yes houses burned down because of this

640
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,509
so be careful dry failure rates increase

641
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,820
dramatically when dries off right out of

642
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,820
their operating temperatures so that's a

643
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,249
fun fact for you ok let's say you want

644
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,450
to rebuilt the pre-built server is a

645
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:57,279
great way to go if you don't want to get

646
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,830
your hands during do-it-yourself the the

647
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,200
thing sir rs1 40s right here in the ps1

648
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,710
40s I don't know how but a slip through

649
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,450
the cracks

650
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,039
a lot of the live guys aren't even using

651
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,559
them enterprises that are throwing away

652
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:10,749
for about a hundred bucks to 150 to 200

653
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,539
somewhere there they do 35 watts at idle

654
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:15,610
and 50 to 60 under load they're running

655
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:17,289
a Xeon e3 1200 series which is the

656
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,340
version 3 which is actually fairly

657
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,200
recent you get four pretty solid cores

658
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,789
and they support Intel Quick Sync so if

659
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,850
you want to do any type of offloading of

660
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:29,889
your encoding for NVR cameras like that

661
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,840
fantastic option there they come up and

662
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,219
on ebay every now and they're not not

663
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,850
all the time but they're a fantastic

664
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,879
option next is a Super Micro x9 series

665
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,080
these come in literally everything most

666
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,649
people did white-label a lot of Super

667
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,480
Micro stuff the CSEA 25 fantastic

668
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,309
starting place if I want to find Super

669
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,440
Micro gear on ebay I just search for a

670
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:51,759
Super Micro Spacey 5 and that will kind

671
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,499
of show me all the e5 series that are

672
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,149
coming up and then kind of check your

673
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:56,860
process your process or compatibility

674
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:59,018
matrix your Intel Arc all that stuff to

675
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,850
make sure it is what you want they come

676
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:02,289
with an else I RAID controller it's an

677
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,209
HPA but most people call them raid

678
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,769
controllers and they're about 200 bucks

679
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,080
and you have 200 letters shipped to your

680
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:09,610
door today I actually noticed some the

681
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,689
slide show those are links when I hand

682
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,070
that out you can click on and not you

683
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,659
take you to an eBay auction it's not

684
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,399
mine I'm not making money off this it's

685
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:17,830
just something I found because a lot of

686
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,139
these presentations I go to they'd say

687
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,759
you can get these for $80 and you got

688
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:23,649
eBay and they're all 600 bucks I'm like

689
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,360
are you sure that's why I put them in

690
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,939
there the next one I have is called the

691
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,559
fat twin which less Super Micro and

692
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,539
they're weird and naming things but fat

693
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,629
twin it's actually two nodes

694
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:38,139
side-by-side in a single chassis and

695
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:39,189
both of them are twin efox and you can

696
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,508
actually slide to them they share

697
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,090
they've redone a power supply on the

698
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,799
backplane and they've got three PCI

699
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,240
Express slots in them so you can use

700
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,759
those for a 10 gig card or other stuff

701
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,529
really cool chassis if you want to go

702
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,119
really nutso and I applaud you and

703
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,409
please send me pictures they got this

704
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,869
for you CSCE

705
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:58,299
a 46 that's got 24 size bays in the

706
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:59,949
front of it you want to talk a build a

707
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,320
FreeNAS that's your ticket right there

708
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,659
that thing would be rad as far as the

709
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,059
Dells go our 720 r6 20s are great buys

710
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:09,639
right now I say avoid the r7 10 if you

711
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,720
want to stick on the HCL for VMware if

712
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,918
you don't care about that you're just

713
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,269
gonna run whatever Linux Windows

714
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,369
whatever on it you're probably fine with

715
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,879
a r7 10 and those are getting super

716
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,678
cheap

717
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:20,320
those are also labeled across 20

718
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,149
different labels so you can find little

719
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,009
super cheap and they pretty fantastic be

720
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:25,389
careful with the version 1 or version 2

721
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,830
compatibility in the processors because

722
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,139
it can get tricky and they had kind of a

723
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,970
mid-cycle refresh on those you have to

724
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:31,570
be careful there are a little bit on

725
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,830
power-hungry

726
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,720
they come with their perc raid

727
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,460
controllers raid controllers and there

728
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,320
about 300 to 500 dollars depending on

729
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,970
your loadout so let's kind of like your

730
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,439
do-it-yourself and these kind of your

731
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,860
pre-built so if you wanna build a server

732
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,020
now it's getting nutty out of warranty

733
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,760
LAN optimizers now you'd never think hey

734
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,639
I'm gonna build a riverbed I make an

735
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,419
ESXi server out of it you can and it's

736
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,100
fantastic really low power I'm talking

737
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,580
Full Tilt the sucker running as hard as

738
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,418
I can

739
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:04,840
25 watts is all it takes it's an 8 core

740
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,400
Xeon proc they don't tell you exactly

741
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,870
what modeled is but if you go and do

742
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,090
some digging it's I've narrowed it down

743
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,100
to two specific models it's like I said

744
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,149
it's a it's a soldered on solution it's

745
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,439
not meant ever be changed

746
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:20,230
runs ESXi just fine open sense wicked

747
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,210
open sense performance it's got eight or

748
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,380
six or eight gig gigabit ports right

749
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,780
across the front so if you want to do

750
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,789
some crazy multi LANs other stuff you

751
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,230
can totally do it you have to turn the

752
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,720
network cards from non pass-through to

753
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,100
regular but it's not easily done the

754
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,570
only thing to be careful to remember the

755
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,280
CX 770 careful with your ram

756
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,200
compatibility they can be a little picky

757
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,020
and they're gonna have RAM limitations

758
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,309
as well so as a monster hypervisor not

759
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,360
so much but if you want to run a bunch

760
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,149
of small stuff that doesn't require

761
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,449
about your am absolutely do it the next

762
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:52,299
one's the dfid T 120 to be e second

763
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:56,350
generation excuse me that's a mouthful

764
00:27:52,299 --> 00:28:01,418
there 120 bucks you get an AMD rx series

765
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:04,240
4 core at 2.7 gigahertz base 3.6 boost

766
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:05,919
with an in grade in a graded Vega

767
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,500
graphics chip so you can do some room

768
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,049
ATI offloading stuff they also have a

769
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,669
PCI 8x slot in a 16 X form factor so it

770
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:14,830
just has the lanes of an 8 X but

771
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:16,780
physically it's a 16 X and therefore

772
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,168
status if you want to build a really

773
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,428
cheap multi node lab set up those are

774
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:23,110
about a hundred and twenty bucks apiece

775
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,480
and you can pick up three of them and

776
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,649
maybe a fantastic little in lab they

777
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,549
come and go and and available is limited

778
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,230
unfortunately all the lab guys got

779
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,668
turned on to this and they go nuts

780
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,169
forums they sell out really quick when

781
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,000
they hit eBay but you can get one there

782
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:38,830
fantastic that's what's running my

783
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,159
current production open sense does that

784
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,320
guy right there and it's fantastic now

785
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,370
another cheap way to do it and a lot of

786
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,928
folks do this and this is a great way to

787
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,639
do it is get workstation class machines

788
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,630
you're still getting a Xeon

789
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,820
you're still getting something that's

790
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,320
rated for 24/7 operation for business

791
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,210
use but you can find it quite a bit

792
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,490
cheaper than all servers in the HP

793
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:01,210
series you're lookin at Z 400 Z's 600 z

794
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:03,490
6 20s the 80s z 8 20s they can be held

795
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,400
there they're a gamut of prices from 100

796
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,990
to 300 dollars they make fantastic labs

797
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,210
absolutely fantastic good in those same

798
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,549
a5 processors which was on my list of

799
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,600
the ones I liked but you're spending

800
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,150
quite a bit less you're gonna be usually

801
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,649
probably single proc but that's okay the

802
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,770
Dell Precision counterparts that is the

803
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:23,500
5600 series it's same processors just in

804
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,120
a dell flavor if you prefer dale the 36

805
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,160
hundreds are cool you can get those

806
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,100
working as well they are stuck on

807
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,929
version 1 of the e5 2600 series but they

808
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,699
work just fine for a home lab and then

809
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:37,150
Supermicro also makes called be super

810
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,780
workstation so it's another totally

811
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,490
viable option for you so that's kind of

812
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,410
more of the pre-built so you got your

813
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,760
do-it-yourself which works you can get

814
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,620
decommissioned servers or you do some

815
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,600
workstations or some crazy riverbeds

816
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,070
which are that link right there is

817
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,649
actually active and they've lowered the

818
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,090
price down to 175 today so after this I

819
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,940
may be buying it alright you might have

820
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:01,090
you might be B to it networking

821
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:05,650
one gig is dead long live 10 gig in the

822
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,870
homeland kind of as far as network cards

823
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,940
go the Mellanox connect decks X 2 and X

824
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,469
3s are fantastic for home labs you get a

825
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,320
single port or dual port they come in a

826
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,790
10 gig SFP+ they're 22 for do depending

827
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,149
on your branding you can get them in an

828
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,830
HP branded or Mellanox themselves the

829
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,660
chelsea OT 420 another great option

830
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,710
those are all dual sfp+ is 35 to 40 and

831
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,850
slap those in here to em on your PCI

832
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,260
Express slots and you've got 10 gig

833
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,340
which is which is really awesome

834
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,309
especially if you're going to do any

835
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:37,899
type of hyper-converged from my testing

836
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:40,899
even with an often up front and a sat on

837
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,030
the back end I end up maxing about 2.3

838
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,740
gigabits per second on my ports as far

839
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,940
as that goes so a lot of people say well

840
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,070
how about InfiniBand can you run

841
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,840
InfiniBand at home absolutely you can I

842
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,418
know some guys that do it it's just

843
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,918
those are 40 gigs you can if you hit the

844
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,480
pricing right you can get one for cheap

845
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,809
and it's fantastic and it works out for

846
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,100
you

847
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,570
just know you're kind of going in a

848
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,129
cul-de-sac you're not going through

849
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,020
there's no exit strategy there you're

850
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,309
running InfiniBand

851
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,020
and you have to uplink it to the rest of

852
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,620
your network so just know that going in

853
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,210
but you can absolutely do it power usage

854
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,678
this is just an interesting tidbit that

855
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,350
I found out as far as what use are the

856
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,910
most power or at least to most DAC cable

857
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,439
as your least and then you have your

858
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,030
transceiver plus fire and then the one

859
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,710
that surprised me the most is a 10 10 G

860
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,420
base D copper actually uses the most

861
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,270
power out of all those which I found

862
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,120
quite surprising I don't work for FS

863
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,460
comm whatsoever I just like them if you

864
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,350
want to buy optics Dax fiber patches

865
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,140
they'll get it to you within a few days

866
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,419
and it's about 10 bucks 10 bucks for a 6

867
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,100
foot back cable and they're super nice

868
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,540
kind of awkward though cuz sometimes

869
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,100
they'll call you randomly and ask you if

870
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
you liked your purchase which is weird

871
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,649
because they're like hey is that working

872
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,820
you have that deployed your enterprise

873
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,920
and I'm sitting there in my mechanical

874
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,070
room going yeah yeah it's in prod that's

875
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,150
great I love it they're super nice I

876
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,379
love it it's like great customer service

877
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,700
but they're they're thinking I'm

878
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,250
something like big business I'm just a

879
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,420
dude who moved as you know water

880
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,420
softener Singh for another rack

881
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,790
who needs soft water I need more power

882
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:08,130
talking about switching one thing where

883
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,350
I do allow in my own rules to let home

884
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,480
lab and home product of mix is my

885
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,678
network or just because I don't like to

886
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,990
have to do an uplink and run two

887
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,610
switches if you want to run a home

888
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,210
switch with 10 gig here's some options

889
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,490
for you

890
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,640
brocade I see X 64 50 series they come

891
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:26,250
in a 48 port 1 gig Keowee which is nice

892
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,050
and then for 10 gig ports just please be

893
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,300
careful with port licensing brocade

894
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,550
loves to give you 4 ports but only 2 of

895
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,040
them work until you buy license and in a

896
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,210
home live environment yeah that makes it

897
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,000
not attractive so find one that is

898
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,370
licensing the real money though in this

899
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,360
one right here is your Aruba as 2500 and

900
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:48,419
yes 3500 these are fantastic 48 ports

901
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,629
gig p OE plus in fact and then for 10

902
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,610
gig ports they're about $125 and you're

903
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,220
talking 48 gig boards and for 10 gigs

904
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,870
and they're not horribly loud as long as

905
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,790
you stick with the lower up power

906
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,830
supplies they got a higher version and a

907
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,720
lower version stick lower unless you're

908
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,639
gonna run some crazy amount of p OE

909
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,860
devices which again I applaud you you're

910
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,660
awesome but just be careful that a rube

911
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,909
is rad because they own them

912
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,320
Ruba slash ruckus they actually give

913
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,700
away firmware updates for free there's

914
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,840
not behind a paywall so you actually go

915
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,060
to their site and pull the latest

916
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,590
updates for your switch which is

917
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,360
fantastic to have I love that if you

918
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:25,110
want to go Siskel and I get it

919
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,020
WS 3750 e you get 48 ports 1 gig +10

920
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:31,679
gigs there xfp instead of SFP just keep

921
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,330
that mind if you a lot of people see the

922
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,190
Aruban go like I don't know rubas

923
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,409
command-line if you've ever done a Cisco

924
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,480
it's 80% of the way there the review

925
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,660
ends a little funky but I'm happy to

926
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,800
explain how those work - for them

927
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,780
they're great they're absolutely great

928
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,720
that's what I'm running I was running a

929
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,760
brocade but it explode due to a power

930
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,430
issue that I had that was caused by

931
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,810
myself

932
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:57,510
let's talk storage I love the storage

933
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,649
part and I love my the 2000s called and

934
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,450
they want their hardware raid cards back

935
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,640
HBAs and software raids are all the

936
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,340
hotness right now and it's true I love

937
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,140
it right size your storage before you

938
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,149
start going nutty with nvme and cache

939
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,629
and optional and stuff maximize your RAM

940
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,549
first that will give you much more bang

941
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,899
for your buck going forward if you're

942
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,610
going to do spinning platters I'd say

943
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,690
stick to the 54 hundred rpms just

944
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,350
because you're gonna spend a lot less

945
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,090
power and heat and other things on that

946
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,350
aligns mind your bus make sure you

947
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,120
balance them if you got multi proc

948
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,179
systems and become real comfy with

949
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,199
cabling types and closures back planes

950
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,810
like you don't want the first time you

951
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,629
ever see an s FF 8087 to be like what is

952
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,159
and can i plug this into my dl380 so

953
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:41,159
just give them their worth that talking

954
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,899
about SSDs nvme is actually getting

955
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,909
pretty cheap and the reason being is

956
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,589
datacenters are starting to move the Gen

957
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:49,200
one drives that they put in out of

958
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,450
service so you're talking the the Intel

959
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,370
data center drive P 35 20s you get it

960
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:57,089
from in a four or 50 gig or a 1.2

961
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:59,279
terabyte flavor and I'm kidding that's a

962
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,710
hundred eleven dollars for 1.2 1.2 T

963
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,480
nvme and I literally bought it last week

964
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,130
so that price is actually accurate if

965
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,430
you do a best offer of 111 they'll take

966
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,510
it just FYI

967
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,799
they're fantastic they're available in

968
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,380
you dot 2 or you can actually do a full

969
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,270
PCIe slot which works fine too if you

970
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,250
wanna go the sadder out the dcs 35

971
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,670
hundreds or 35 tens or fantastic options

972
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,440
we're talking 80 gigs for 12 bucks 120

973
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,460
gigs for 20 bucks now you notice that

974
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,890
I've got some writing

975
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,780
after the after the capacity and before

976
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,730
the price the tbw that's your terabyte

977
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,000
Renton that's your lifespan of your SSD

978
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,130
just in case anyone doesn't know in this

979
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,540
room you probably all do that SSDs have

980
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,920
a lifespan they have a certain number of

981
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,980
bytes they can write to him that's a

982
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,380
thing most consumer grades even a nice

983
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,790
like a nice one are gonna max out about

984
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,349
200 terabytes written for a one terabyte

985
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,089
drive that's about where they are

986
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,950
planned obsolescence gotta love it

987
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,810
Enterprise drives on the other hand for

988
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,240
a one point two is fourteen eighty

989
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,339
terabytes retina so if you're in the

990
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,939
market for an nvme drive consider going

991
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:59,190
enterprise

992
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,260
now I already see all of you looking at

993
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,330
me going I don't have a you dot to slot

994
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,410
in my PC or in my server and all the

995
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:09,900
servers you mentioned won't have you

996
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,430
done - haha we can do this they actually

997
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,440
sell PCI Express to you top two

998
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,000
converters that's a star tech there's

999
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,410
another one there's another company that

1000
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,849
sells on their own Amazon they're on a

1001
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,819
few other places I don't run you about

1002
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:22,140
$39 and you take your YouTube just slide

1003
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,580
it right in there you put the screws on

1004
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,129
the back and you drop in a PCI Express

1005
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:29,098
slot and suddenly you have got nvme

1006
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,200
goodness they also sell it in at MDOT -

1007
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,480
- yup - adapter it looks like that guy

1008
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,460
right there the only trouble with those

1009
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,170
is you have to pull power off a SATA

1010
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,119
header off your power supply they don't

1011
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,500
power them there the card the Cardinals

1012
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,640
self will power the whole Drive so you

1013
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,320
just drop it in and you're and you're

1014
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,029
good to go

1015
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,160
but those what the m2 is you have to put

1016
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,660
a power header on there and I will give

1017
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,129
anyone extra points for dropping

1018
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,560
enterprise SSDs in their gaming rig

1019
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,300
that's what I do that's sitting right

1020
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,859
below my graphics card it works great

1021
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,450
make sure when you buy one of these

1022
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:59,580
there's some that don't have this cut

1023
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,899
out there there's a heatsink there's a

1024
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,609
heat spreader on the back of that drive

1025
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,810
you want that so it can heat can escape

1026
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:05,339
the thing because it's sitting in there

1027
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,589
as you can see upside down and the heat

1028
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,540
spreaders are up just some of those will

1029
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:12,420
not have a cutout and they can get kind

1030
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,800
of toasty now as far as like lifetime on

1031
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,839
them and how good they're written might

1032
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,650
have a 93% of its life left when I put

1033
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,119
it in when you're buying one when you're

1034
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,619
buying one I'd reach out to the seller

1035
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,869
and say hey can you give me an S been on

1036
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,310
you know lifetime Intel sell the tool

1037
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,040
they'll actually pull it up and say hey

1038
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,509
we're at 90% life and here's how much

1039
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,589
space has been written and all that most

1040
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,790
sellers are pretty cool about it won't

1041
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,990
say hey here's where it's at you'll be

1042
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,440
somewhere in this range and if you're

1043
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,459
not will sell you new one

1044
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,170
they're not gonna go test them for you

1045
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,119
but most sellers are pretty cool about

1046
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,720
it if you're buying one secondhand test

1047
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,670
it yourself

1048
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,129
it's a tiny Intel utility they give it

1049
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,599
out for free works great use don't want

1050
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,369
to buy an enterprise SSD like on its

1051
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,069
last legs that's the only the only real

1052
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:53,260
takeaway they're talkin capacity if you

1053
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,390
want to go spinning platters if you want

1054
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,210
to go most bang for your buck most

1055
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,348
storage you go to Best Buy and you're

1056
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,140
all looking at me really funny right now

1057
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:04,750
like Best Buy you buy the Western

1058
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,940
Digital easy stores they are a Best Buy

1059
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,730
exclusive it's the only place you can

1060
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,730
get it but inside of this very

1061
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,890
attractive black casing is a Western

1062
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,560
Digital red or a white labeled red drive

1063
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:20,890
which as you know is the NAS Drive that

1064
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,250
is built for 24/7 operation and is built

1065
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,540
for naz's this is still a valid thing I

1066
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,000
bought one last month they're still

1067
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,910
white the Reds you stress test them

1068
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,569
before you shuck them or not the hard

1069
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:36,490
way you will buy this external drive

1070
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:37,990
plugging in your machine right across

1071
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,220
little platter give it a stress test use

1072
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,959
a utility something about make sure it's

1073
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,270
good and then you shuck it like an

1074
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,890
oyster and you pop the drive out of the

1075
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,240
enclosure you put it in your own server

1076
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,980
and you're off to the races

1077
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,200
as far as warranty where it goes I

1078
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,700
actually keep one of these the one that

1079
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,930
I did the best job on shucking that

1080
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,368
looks like there's no damage on it I

1081
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,290
keep one of these just in my closet in

1082
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,000
the event a drive fails cuz they do have

1083
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,290
three year warranties on them and I've

1084
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,579
put one back into the enclosure and

1085
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,550
shipped it off and gotten a new one just

1086
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:05,920
fine so you can do it be careful whether

1087
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:09,730
that's legal or ethical I don't know but

1088
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,290
yeah it's a hard drive isn't it I know

1089
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,339
I'm gonna get like hauled off like the

1090
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,589
Western Digital police are gonna come

1091
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:17,490
and get me after that great we'll enjoy

1092
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:21,130
it folks the last time you'll see this

1093
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,328
as far as raid controllers HP is of a

1094
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:26,140
hotness that's where you want to be

1095
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:29,410
software aids are great FreeNAS ZFS like

1096
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,629
I love ZFS I had my pea 410 diet and it

1097
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,299
made me sad inside I've had several

1098
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,920
boxes just flat-out die I've grabbed my

1099
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,560
drives ran him over to a new machine

1100
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,730
plug them all in ZFS found them all and

1101
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,119
said yep there's your drive we're off to

1102
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,010
the races

1103
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:45,310
so ZFS is great these are fantastic

1104
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,510
options for free HBA is most some

1105
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,220
motherboard headers actually have enough

1106
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,590
SATA headers on there for you and might

1107
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,029
be some

1108
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:54,020
ported which it works fine if it's not

1109
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:57,020
these your options all of these the 92

1110
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,360
10s 11s 9 207's all are on the VMware

1111
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,580
HCl and your FreeNAS guides so they're

1112
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,110
well supported you'll notice there's an

1113
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,520
eye on the end of some of them or an e

1114
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,560
that basically tells you whether the

1115
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,570
connectors internal external if you get

1116
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,210
one with an e you can do something super

1117
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:14,450
nutty and awesome and get yourself a

1118
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,950
Zyra text-based sass sash tray so you

1119
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,100
can actually go by yourself just a dumb

1120
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:21,379
6 gigs ass enclosure has a bunch of bays

1121
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,990
in it you slap that in run one single

1122
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,060
cable up to your to your HPA and you now

1123
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:28,129
have an entire shelf of spinning drives

1124
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,440
for super cheap

1125
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,550
those are running about 100 bucks for

1126
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,380
these enclosures and they and they come

1127
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,020
under a few names Dell Compellent

1128
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,580
they're also our tech base SC 200s you

1129
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,810
can find him out there and some of the

1130
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,580
guides and resources I'll give you after

1131
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,560
this can help you find which ones are

1132
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,390
great I know one person doing that right

1133
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,670
now he went through a very difficult

1134
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,150
learning phase because he bought a dell

1135
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,380
tray or a Dell EMC which has different

1136
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,540
formatting and it was just a it was a

1137
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,460
nightmare but there's some definitely

1138
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,470
some good options here if you want to

1139
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,540
look at the reliability charts black

1140
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,730
back glaze puts these out every quarter

1141
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,270
I think or every semi-annually or

1142
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,480
something

1143
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,320
and honestly I used to like really

1144
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,850
agonize over these and be like holy

1145
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,500
smokes I have to make sure not all which

1146
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,110
drives the best avoid the Seagate's get

1147
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,250
the hg s DS get the WT reds in all

1148
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,670
honesty that you've gotten all pretty

1149
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,050
close lately they're all pretty much

1150
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,980
within a few percent of percentage

1151
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,720
points of each other so I haven't

1152
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,480
worried too much about it recently and

1153
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,970
again all my drives are coming from Best

1154
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,460
Buy parenthetically it's almost Black

1155
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:31,040
Friday and you'll see an 8 terabyte

1156
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,680
drive go to 129 and a 10 turbo drive go

1157
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,140
to 149 on Black Friday so I will see you

1158
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,669
fine folks at black best non Black

1159
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,400
Friday Best Buy and be like a lion

1160
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,900
drives huh you'll see all the home lab

1161
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,880
or show up cuz every else is gone for

1162
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,650
the Xbox's in the PlayStation the TVs

1163
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,600
and I'm over there like gathering these

1164
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,540
up like me go looking for this precious

1165
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,740
drives you know right growling at people

1166
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,300
who just want to do a backup of their

1167
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:58,520
family photos like no need them my more

1168
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,320
okay let's talk software on the top be

1169
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,050
Santa's rad there's a reason they charge

1170
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,390
so much for it

1171
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,500
for be my cue game to it thing to know

1172
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,868
about visa and if you're gonna and this

1173
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,619
is most this is mostly my

1174
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,839
hyper-converged slide if you weren't on

1175
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:12,609
hyper-converged at home which you can do

1176
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:14,410
and I've done it you're three node

1177
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:16,630
minimum four V San you have to have one

1178
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:19,328
cash in one capacity minimum per disc

1179
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,700
group you get no inline deduplication or

1180
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,410
compression if you have any spinning

1181
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,990
media in your disc group just something

1182
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:28,210
to keep in mind and with a three nodes

1183
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,430
you're stuck to raid one type formatting

1184
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,260
so your your capacity gets cut in half

1185
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,819
you really if you want to do these stand

1186
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,440
for realsies you need to go for a node

1187
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,150
or higher but that gets pricey yeah I

1188
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,200
get it a little bit cheaper often you

1189
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,480
can do storage spaces direct from

1190
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,950
Microsoft as 2d you need to have the

1191
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,650
intel on a limb or later processor

1192
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,000
that's kind of your i7 920 if you

1193
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,670
remember that era and it's compatible

1194
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,109
Xeon and forward I'll support that you

1195
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,000
need two SSDs and four hard drives

1196
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,799
minimum but you only need two notes and

1197
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,660
it actually works pretty well it's it's

1198
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,130
performant I mean a home lab it's fun to

1199
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,259
play with I set it up just for grins

1200
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,640
because I want to try it out the last

1201
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,790
bullet point if you wanna more do more

1202
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,220
traditional instead of hyper-converged

1203
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:08,740
ZFS on freenas and then you just I

1204
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,689
scuzzy NFS whatever you need to to get

1205
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,399
it out to your compute boost your ram

1206
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,829
before doing your SSD cache can't stress

1207
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,650
that enough 32 gigs on a on a ZFS pool

1208
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:19,810
is a good thing is a good kind of good

1209
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,760
rule of thumb it used to be like one gig

1210
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,470
per one terabyte it but now it's just 32

1211
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,940
gigs it generally enough i've got a

1212
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:28,029
hundred and forty-four gigs in my free

1213
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:31,720
nas box for two reasons one I literally

1214
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:35,829
bought a cardboard box of RAM in a Sears

1215
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,859
parking lot I don't know where it came

1216
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:42,310
from but I ended up with nearly a

1217
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:44,200
terabyte of ddr3 ECC memory so I took

1218
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,359
everything I wanted hock the rest on

1219
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,049
ebay funded more of my addiction that's

1220
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:51,520
what I did so I've got a bunch run gels

1221
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,230
in FreeNAS so my Plex is running in a

1222
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,310
jail which is fun play one fun way to

1223
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,000
learn about jails and all that good

1224
00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:00,520
stuff one thing don't install prinos on

1225
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,900
a USB or an SD card your performance

1226
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,460
will be abysmal when you do updates

1227
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,200
it'll run fine once the things booted

1228
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,869
but you're talking like a 30 minute

1229
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:12,299
upgrade boot up window which is painful

1230
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:12,300
and also panic-inducing

1231
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:19,959
the last thing I'm gonna say here is do

1232
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:22,210
not do hardware RAID with ZFS ever like

1233
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,290
really don't that's a horrible idea you

1234
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,300
need to have your drives go straight

1235
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,520
into ZFS to command them otherwise you

1236
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,380
have an abstracted the abstract upon

1237
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,660
abstract and things get really dicey and

1238
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,950
you will have a sad day let's talk

1239
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,529
mounting options

1240
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:39,129
has anyone heard of the lack rack yeah

1241
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,869
19 inches across IKEA you geniuses so

1242
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,740
you can rack things between this little

1243
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:45,280
lack cute end table for $12.99

1244
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,970
unfortunately in the last two years

1245
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,650
they've made the top the top about that

1246
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,390
much of it is solid wood and then they

1247
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,880
do that hollow fiber board in the middle

1248
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,500
so in my excitement to get everything

1249
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,490
racked up my first two mounted upgrade

1250
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,690
and the other thing I don't like about

1251
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,459
them is you have to use wood screws

1252
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,560
which is super ghetto and you can't like

1253
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,840
move it ever but anyway so I put my two

1254
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,240
switches up on top I go to put in one of

1255
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,060
my servers drilled in and go in the fell

1256
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,618
down I was like dang it so I was

1257
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,000
actually gonna bring a lack and cut it

1258
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,920
in half and show you that it was hollow

1259
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,250
but it wouldn't be kind of awkward the

1260
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,599
microphone what not but yeah you can do

1261
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,770
them if you're only doing like a switch

1262
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,440
or two on top you can't get away with

1263
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,140
the lack rack um if you're chaff is

1264
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,900
relatively low get some two by twos and

1265
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,220
just screw some wrapped rails into them

1266
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,180
works great in build your own four post

1267
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,730
rack for dirt cheap

1268
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,830
and you're off to the races other thing

1269
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,300
folks do this is something that my good

1270
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,890
friend Ukiah turned me on to with is a

1271
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,800
portable LAN party in a box if you ever

1272
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,569
seen that musicians rackmount cases they

1273
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,690
put their amps and gear in these little

1274
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,770
portable cases guess what they're 19

1275
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,170
inches across and you put whatever you

1276
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,119
want in them careful sometimes they're

1277
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,609
not deep enough because a lot of the a

1278
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,609
lot of that stuff isn't really built for

1279
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:58,660
servers obviously so they'll you'll end

1280
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:01,140
up hanging out the back you'll have

1281
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,009
little flags hanging out back your thing

1282
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,598
chaff is gonna be hard if you put a

1283
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:08,980
musicians case in your front room put a

1284
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:10,510
lamp on it maybe I don't know I'm sorry

1285
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,480
I can't even relate to that I'm like hey

1286
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,010
I just do whatever crazy stuff I want

1287
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,210
keep in mind racking is great and it's a

1288
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,190
tidy way to do it and a lot of stuff

1289
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,790
comes in a rack mount may not be your

1290
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,730
best option

1291
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,650
really they can be efficient but they

1292
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,820
can come in the sanity of noise

1293
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,490
pollution

1294
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,740
I'm gonna level with y'all right now

1295
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,850
it's not like noise server fans aren't

1296
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,410
white-nose I've heard that arguing story

1297
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,839
times like well my servers loud it's

1298
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:37,750
white noise no it's annoying and their

1299
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,580
shrill it don't fool yourself tower

1300
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,900
servers are generally quieter put them

1301
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,190
on the bottom of your bread rack put

1302
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,360
some networking on top keyboard mouse

1303
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,910
can have your so a little tight a little

1304
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,310
set a tiny little set up velcro no

1305
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,140
spaghetti monsters you only saw my rack

1306
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:54,100
how horribly spaghetti it was that's

1307
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,480
okay do as I say not as I do now I read

1308
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,610
somewhere somewhere that somewhere

1309
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,160
something somewhere that all

1310
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:01,870
presentations have a stat so hundred

1311
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,080
percent of IT professionals should have

1312
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,819
a home lab I made it up and Google said

1313
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,319
I should have done that so here's some

1314
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,600
resources to follow and contribute to

1315
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,180
serve the homebuyers guide forums you'll

1316
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,310
find some serious lab or there reddit

1317
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,870
there's a great subreddit for home labs

1318
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,970
you got people who've done all sorts of

1319
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,890
crazy stuff with that you need some

1320
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:22,930
benchmark white papers hop on YouTube

1321
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,850
watch some videos this bottom one is a

1322
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,169
is a QR code for the discord it's a

1323
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,089
discord group for the Utah home lab

1324
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,820
builders we just barely started that up

1325
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,320
please feel free to join us contribute

1326
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,670
learn you got quite a few guys that have

1327
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,400
done some pretty crazy stuff in there so

1328
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:39,100
feel free to come on in and ask some

1329
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,600
questions and to finish up I wanted to

1330
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,490
talk a little bit about what happens

1331
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,950
when your boss green lights and sponsors

1332
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:49,029
key word and I said a layup and you have

1333
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:51,520
a spare cubicle you get that we have six

1334
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,890
individual nodes there's the on D series

1335
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,700
that's the embedded series eight cores

1336
00:47:53,890 --> 00:48:00,250
16 threads at 80 watts each 256 gig DDR

1337
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,379
M each one duel 10 Giga sefie pluses

1338
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,680
they're running Intel obtain 800 ps4

1339
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:08,680
their cash tier in an m2 for net that's

1340
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,310
4,600 SSDs one taped on fan we'll get on

1341
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,589
to that in a little bit I've got new

1342
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,870
biggity X 16 G switch you get 12 ports

1343
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,910
of sfp+ 4 quarts of 100 ones 10

1344
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:21,609
I got a Cisco 3750 that was literally

1345
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,589
sitting under my desk and a lowly end of

1346
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,180
warranty Dell if you can see it sitting

1347
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,320
right there that's for when someone

1348
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,089
breaks their vCenter and they have to

1349
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,620
recover it it's klaris we call that the

1350
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,910
Dell of shame just as far as a

1351
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,750
performance which you'll get out of that

1352
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,920
I ran the official VMware HCI

1353
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,980
performance

1354
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,890
monitor I got 76,000 iocked each side so

1355
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,380
grand total 150 mm I ops out of some

1356
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,670
cheap super micro sitting in a cubicle

1357
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,770
pretty darn impressive I think and

1358
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,079
you're talking to 30 grand online that's

1359
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:54,450
for everything in there we also decided

1360
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,040
to modify it slightly and do a VDI if

1361
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,750
anyone heard about virtual desktops I

1362
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,589
don't any of that and I had to put an

1363
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,420
enterprise I had to put an enterprise

1364
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:05,700
video card in it and you'll see those

1365
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,869
are meant to be done with fav passive

1366
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,970
cooling and just passed that through

1367
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,440
since it was passively cooled I had to

1368
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,808
put my own fans in it and I made the

1369
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:20,880
cardboard duct master of 3000 right

1370
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:22,500
there founders edition and yeah the card

1371
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,079
gets pretty warm and you can own their

1372
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,670
own the VDI lab for about an hour

1373
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,530
parenthetically you mentioned I've

1374
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,119
talked about the tape donphan when we

1375
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,130
bought these super micro didn't have a

1376
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:36,150
port or didn't have a part number for an

1377
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,190
actively cooled device and so I had to

1378
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,630
basically figure out my own I went

1379
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,520
through for several iterations I 3d

1380
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:45,660
printed a little box that went on it but

1381
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,299
I meant melted the PLA and then my best

1382
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:50,848
solution was actually 3m adhesive and I

1383
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:52,259
took 120 millimeter fan and I just blew

1384
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:53,849
it across this heat spreader but that

1385
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,430
one exhausting out actually works great

1386
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:58,440
I've never had a problem my boss hated

1387
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,868
that idea he said I just spent $30,000

1388
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,400
and you're taping on fans until I walked

1389
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,780
out to his BMW and showed that his side

1390
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,369
panels will held on with the same tape

1391
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:11,280
and my yeah so it ends up working up

1392
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:13,020
great like I said the whole point of

1393
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,369
home lab is building it and having fun

1394
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,069
and learning you don't have to go nuts

1395
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:19,230
you don't have to have you know 150,000

1396
00:50:17,069 --> 00:50:21,540
I ops but get started get playing with

1397
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,740
it and thank you so much for coming you

1398
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,359
have any questions for me I think we

1399
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:28,828
have like a few minutes just real quick

1400
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:30,540
yeah good I'm gonna I'm gonna post it on

1401
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:31,980
the scheduler dealio they all sign up

1402
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,049
for it there's a way to like distribute

1403
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,040
slides to class and then I'll type of

1404
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:37,790
the saint's con folks if there's an

1405
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,790
alternate that those didn't use that

1406
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,790
yeah

1407
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,080
um if I was just getting started

1408
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,640
for the very first time it depends kind

1409
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,860
of what your enterprise marks like if

1410
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,270
you're like a VMware shop run ESX and

1411
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,560
start writing some one little VMs you

1412
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,120
can actually do the free version that

1413
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,029
doesn't have V Center you know and that

1414
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,100
as long as you want but honestly I'd do

1415
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,720
FreeNAS trina's is awesome out of the

1416
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,400
box you can consolidate your storage you

1417
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,470
can run jails you can do plex you can do

1418
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,920
pie holes all stuff like that free now

1419
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:12,020
is a great spot I like it cool thank you

1420
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:20,719
