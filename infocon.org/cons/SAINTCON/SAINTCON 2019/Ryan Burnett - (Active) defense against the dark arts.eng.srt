00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:12,230
welcome everyone

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,070
appreciate you staying late on a

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:21,779
Thursday this far into the con great to

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,750
see familiar faces out there just a

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,570
little bit about me so my name is Ryan

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,359
Burnett I'm the director sack ops over

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,700
at Pluralsight I've been at Pluralsight

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,350
a couple years now a little bit about my

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,079
experience I did seven years as a DoD

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,410
contractor doing an IT networking

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,440
security for the Air Force and then

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,078
spent five years redeeming myself after

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,800
working for a company that kills people

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,710
working in healthcare for five years and

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,620
then the past seven years I've been

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,039
working here in Utah around silicon

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,459
slopes building security programs a lot

18
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,010
of startups and companies here so this

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,280
isn't my first rodeo I've done this

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,689
security thing quite a few times so

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,900
that's a little bit about me some of my

22
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,289
hobbies are my family I guess that's a

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,340
hobby my kids keep me busy I like to

24
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,920
listen to and make music I like to sing

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,250
play instruments I like to watch Netflix

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,650
and chill like really watch Netflix and

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,970
chill I like to watch documentaries on

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:39,240
Netflix and other streaming services and

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,100
then I like to read when I can and then

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,619
I really like video games I'm an

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
old-time gamer starting out with command

32
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,090
& Conquer moved up to some other

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,060
first-person shooters and realized that

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,500
I suck really bad and went back to RTS

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,509
and strategy games and then in my spare

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,430
time when I when I can I like to

37
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,890
macGruber some bash scripts together

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,930
I like bash because it's already on the

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,630
machines you don't have to install stuff

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,800
to get it work and it just it works so

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,030
bash is my scripting language of choice

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,090
first of all I want to start give some

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,720
credit

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,940
I attended a blackhat training this year

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,069
first time ever going to blackhat the

46
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,230
training I attended was an active

47
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,540
defense training given by Black Hills

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,369
Information Security John strand

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,010
excellent instructor I can't recommend

50
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,420
it highly enough but I learned a lot of

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,548
these concepts and things I'll be

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,129
talking about today added a little flare

53
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,450
of my own to it with my own experience

54
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,810
but definitely want to give a shout out

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,379
to them and these awesome people that

56
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,849
put this together so those that know me

57
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,940
will know that sometimes I don't have a

58
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,760
filter and sometimes some some swear

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,920
words might come into my talk so these

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,370
are the Utah County swear words that

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,589
might slip in to my talk today so I

62
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,450
apologize ahead ahead of time I was told

63
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,810
I have to actually say these like a yute

64
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,589
on so if I say fat you're fetching or

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,620
fetcher or flip or flipping freak or

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,099
Frick crap she is just ola shut the

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,760
front door and then what the farm farm

68
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:21,100
that's one of my favorites to say and

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:27,060
chappy it basically means bozo right

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:30,250
means bozo to me nobody else okay

71
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,319
so I've heard dark mode is all the rage

72
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,329
right now so let's go ahead and flip

73
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,690
over to dark mode so this is what you're

74
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:40,989
all here to see if you can't tell I've

75
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:44,079
got some Harry Potter theme going on

76
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,450
here with the Defense Against the Dark

77
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:49,299
Arts I like Harry Potter I'm not a huge

78
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,030
fan but I like it enough to glean some

79
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,680
security information from watching the

80
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,359
movies I don't know if you've ever

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,540
watched the movies and put a security

82
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,880
lens on it but you can learn a lot from

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,290
Harry in the game but let's dive into

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm gonna be talking a lot about blue

85
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,599
team's what we have to do is a blue team

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:13,660
is a defender a lot of our struggles

87
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,988
that we deal with and then yeah let's

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,989
have fun

89
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,900
so being on a blue team as a defender

90
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,570
hopefully you got some blue teamers here

91
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,940
do you ever feel this way do you ever

92
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,640
feel like you're picked on like please

93
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,580
don't hurt me you get an Assessor a red

94
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,010
team that comes in and just hones your

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,169
shoes they just come in and own

96
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,420
everything you're just like guys come on

97
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,000
please don't hurt me or maybe as a blue

98
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,640
team or you're just panicking inside all

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,860
the time you've got that inner voice

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,560
that just or sticking with a Harry

101
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,010
Potter theme as a blue team er I feel

102
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,740
like we do need to practice the dark

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,560
arts we need to understand them now we

104
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,600
can't use them that's illegal

105
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
but we need to understand their tactics

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,190
but sometimes maybe as a blue team ring

107
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,430
you may think that the job is jinxed a

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,100
little bit that you can't really win

109
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,200
sometimes like this guy ended up with

110
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,810
his memory wiped this guy's dead this

111
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,510
guy's dead he resigned and then later

112
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:24,440
died and then he's dead and she's in

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,880
prison so as I was watching the movies

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,590
and I'm looking at these Defense Against

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,490
the Dark Arts teachers I'm like man

116
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,630
that's a bad rap that stinks maybe as a

117
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,170
blue teamers sometimes you're just

118
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,780
totally terrified to where you can't

119
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,810
even move you're scared stiff Petrificus

120
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,809
Totalus

121
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,870
but there are all kinds of courage it

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,179
takes a great deal of bravery to stand

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,560
up to our enemies but just as much to

124
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,840
stand up to our friends do you remember

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Neville's standing up to Harry Hermione

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,890
and Ron and they they politely freeze

127
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,480
him he's wearing blue pajamas by the way

128
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:05,300
blue team he's trying to defend but

129
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,760
sometimes as a blue team er we have to

130
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,490
stand up to our friends that could be

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,610
the IT team that could be our executives

132
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,430
our users and we have to stand up and be

133
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,310
like no that's not what we need you to

134
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,080
be doing

135
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,290
so speaking of Neville this is Neville

136
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,440
now he's looking great right way to go

137
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,059
Neville right so we need to get some of

138
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,240
that Neville confidence

139
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:35,009
okay he's looking good so let's let's be

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,229
like Neville Longbottom let's have some

141
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,930
bravery some confidence

142
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,639
let's make blue team's great again okay

143
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,069
I can't do a can't do a good impression

144
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:49,289
but this isn't a political talk it's not

145
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:53,219
but I just love this picture of Trump he

146
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:57,389
really took the time to put a mini gun

147
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,099
in his hand and amigo let's make blue

148
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,009
team's great again let's get some

149
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:04,680
confidence behind us one problem that

150
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,080
we're seeing is what I like to call

151
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,509
Siegel security like you give an

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,139
assessment an auditor or a red team and

153
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,789
they come in just like a seagull and

154
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,419
they swoop in

155
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:20,399
they come in they make a lot of noise

156
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:25,318
they shizz all over everything

157
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:28,229
and then they fly away and they don't

158
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,419
have to deal with the aftermath of the

159
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,610
assessment or trying to fix it or take

160
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,799
you the next 12 months

161
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,479
two years trying to put a program in

162
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,240
place it'll address all the things that

163
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,289
they found right pretty sweet gig if you

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,729
ask me so I love our teams we need red

165
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:51,058
teams I have a lot of red team friends

166
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:54,808
but this style of coming in as a red

167
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:58,379
team it's just it's not helpful right we

168
00:07:54,809 --> 00:08:00,959
we need a better way so what can we do

169
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,969
when we face off against our enemy what

170
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,729
can we do when it's either a real

171
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:08,729
attacker or red team or an Assessor

172
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,830
coming in first of all let's make their

173
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,589
jobs harder let's not make it easy on

174
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,089
them okay they come in they break stuff

175
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,050
they fly away well let's make it hard

176
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:21,409
let's make them cry tears of frustration

177
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,580
when they stumble on our networks okay

178
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:26,308
so I don't know if any of you guys have

179
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,800
ever jumped hurdles let's put a lot of

180
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:31,050
hurdles in for them to jump over there's

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,430
a reason there's not a 1600 meter hurdle

182
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,589
in track and field

183
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,958
because hurdles suck and they're really

184
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,699
hard and he get tired real quick and

185
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,799
that's what we want we want these red

186
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:44,920
teamers these Assessors these attackers

187
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,750
to get tired and move on to the next guy

188
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,910
that's the whole point in this talk

189
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,649
there's not one thing in here that is a

190
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,510
silver bullet that's gonna protect you

191
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,200
you have to do all these things that

192
00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:00,040
we're just trying to wear them down okay

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,890
so whenever we talk about do an active

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,000
defense it always comes up the hacking

195
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:10,269
back right now currently hacking back is

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,920
illegal there's actually a law being

197
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,769
pushed through the house right now a

198
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
bill that's been there a couple years or

199
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,240
trying to push it through well it would

200
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,079
allow people to hack back if they're

201
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,820
under attack okay but currently right

202
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,180
now in our political landscape it is

203
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,220
illegal to hack back so don't I'm not

204
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,500
gonna talk about it too much but that is

205
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,089
an option but believe it or not

206
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,589
criminals they have rights too you're

207
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,180
not allowed to hack back and remember it

208
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,980
could be it could be grandma Ellen's

209
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,140
computer that the attackers use them to

210
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,930
hit you so you're really just hurting

211
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,899
grandma Ellen okay

212
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,649
back in the old days with prospectors

213
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,160
they would put in the 1840s and Gold

214
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,399
Rush

215
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,380
they put shotguns in sheds and someone

216
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,720
came into the shed open still their gold

217
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,360
and kill them or maim them right that's

218
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,839
illegal you can't do that you can't put

219
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,050
shotguns behind doors and it's it's

220
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,540
indiscriminate

221
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,949
is the problem there anybody that opens

222
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,020
that door and if it's a fireman and the

223
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,760
sheds on fire and they come in to put it

224
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,490
out they get shot in the face with

225
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,620
buckshot that's not okay so that kind of

226
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,450
stuff that mentality of well they did it

227
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,160
to me I'm gonna do to them that's not

228
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,860
okay all right

229
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:28,060
so legal legal things aside let's talk

230
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,520
about where is the line so things are

231
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,829
illegal and things are legal to do what

232
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,380
can we do so we're gonna draw the line

233
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,329
or in the middle here of running

234
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,769
commands on the attackers machine if

235
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,109
you're running commands on their machine

236
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,640
you're pretty much over the line you're

237
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,440
on that illegal side I'm not gonna say

238
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,420
you're all the way to the red but you're

239
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,820
pushing it so let's stay a little bit

240
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,250
off of that line and let's do things

241
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,290
that are being used right now by

242
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,660
marketing departments

243
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,680
they do things like use trackers and

244
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,709
they put pixels on things and they track

245
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,050
and get geolocation and they have all

246
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,420
these data elements and points about you

247
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,520
and they know exactly who you are so

248
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,900
let's start using those tactics and find

249
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,340
out who's attacking us let's get a

250
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,050
little bit of attribution it's really

251
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,950
hard to get like definite attribution

252
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,959
but if we know who is attacking us then

253
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:28,090
we can prepare our defenses accordingly

254
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,850
okay so first thing let's get our

255
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,270
shields up remember they put that shield

256
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,180
around Hogwarts let's get our shields up

257
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,310
there's some things that we have to do

258
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,810
that are prerequisite number one thing

259
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,959
that I want to talk about is just taking

260
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:48,099
back the desktop you got to know what's

261
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,350
on your network you got to know what

262
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,230
devices are there what software is

263
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,760
running you you have to have a hardware

264
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,450
and software inventory if you look at

265
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,300
the CIS controls the first 20 questions

266
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,920
are about inventory okay so know what's

267
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,670
on your network know where your critical

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,870
data is on your network okay if I came

269
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,219
to you and said where's your critical

270
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,690
data you might be able to point me a few

271
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,000
servers but what about your corporate

272
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,500
data your each our data your legal data

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,700
all your customer data you've got to

274
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,070
know where that is also you got to

275
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,260
control your endpoints there's a reason

276
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:28,420
that users are call users and not called

277
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,620
admins admins have been rights users

278
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,890
have used your rights

279
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,480
I don't give your users admin rights if

280
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,010
you can help it now I know there's gonna

281
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,630
be exceptions there's times you got to

282
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,240
and they got to install the thing and do

283
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,400
the other thing and also it's the

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,240
culture and nobody wants to upset people

285
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,930
but let the users run at a user level

286
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,280
and then elevate when they need to

287
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,109
install stuff or change things or

288
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,120
configuration or you're devs need to do

289
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,160
stuff like let them elevate up there and

290
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,190
then go back down so day to day they're

291
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,589
running as user ok that's huge

292
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,420
I've been seeing a lot of trends where

293
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,340
we just hand a laptop to people and say

294
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,660
good luck

295
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,480
call me if it breaks

296
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,250
and that doesn't work out too well also

297
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,950
we need to turn on monitoring and do a

298
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,600
central law collection how many of you

299
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,260
actually collect logs on your in points

300
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,960
a few good for you how do you do it with

301
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,270
your remote employees a little harder

302
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,220
right there on the internet the road

303
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,660
warriors how do you get those logs those

304
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,280
security logs that we care about that we

305
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,819
can tell somebody's on their box how do

306
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:38,230
we get those back in or sim warning

307
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,400
banners Terms of Use policies you have

308
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,160
to have policy if you don't have

309
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,630
policies you have no teeth like people

310
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,060
are just not gonna listen to you and

311
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,189
when they break the policy that's not

312
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,079
written down you have nothing to do you

313
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,170
you have no recourse okay

314
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,760
so you have to have policies you got to

315
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,939
get your house in order you got to patch

316
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,220
your systems this seems basic but it's

317
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,500
not happening and we're we're not doing

318
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,420
it soon enough a lot of these

319
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,160
vulnerabilities that we're seeing are

320
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,140
because of people not patching their

321
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,750
systems we see these giant breaches

322
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,840
because people aren't patching are you

323
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,800
scanning your web apps are you scanning

324
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,320
your os's

325
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,599
on your network all of them endpoint

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,980
servers are you doing authenticated

327
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,630
scans probably not maybe are you

328
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,150
scanning for third-party applications

329
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,030
office adobe flash that shouldn't be out

330
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,230
there other things but you got to know

331
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,689
where your data is got to be able to

332
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,660
protect they also treat your internal

333
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:41,380
network as hostile there's this concept

334
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,910
of zero trust your users if you hand

335
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,060
them a laptop and they're using it for

336
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,030
Minecraft and World of Warcraft and who

337
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,729
knows what or their kids are using here

338
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,680
their husband's using it or their wife

339
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:58,620
we don't know what they're putting on

340
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,620
there so we got to treat them as hostile

341
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,480
segmentation some people think the

342
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,490
segmentation means oh ten dot X is over

343
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,870
here and the ten dot Y is over here

344
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,590
that's not segmentation that's

345
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:13,390
subnetting segmentation is ackles

346
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,370
actually having blocks so the computer

347
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,080
at one end of your company can't talk to

348
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,580
a computer the other end of the company

349
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,440
or one end of the stay the other end of

350
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,430
the state actually having things in the

351
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,380
middle the

352
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,870
bakit a lot of people have flat networks

353
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,430
I've seen him there flat as can be and

354
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,970
they're like we have submitting we're

355
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,029
good

356
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:37,300
no ackles firewalls VLANs

357
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,939
also this helps if you do get attacked

358
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,979
or when you do get breached it protects

359
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,470
you and it makes the blast radius the

360
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,920
cleanup and containment and all that

361
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,899
much smaller okay so when people argue

362
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,219
about against segmentation say it's

363
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:55,360
going to help us when we get breached

364
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,310
the blast radius okay and then lastly

365
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,380
like just expect to be breached

366
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,219
anything less nowadays is just denial

367
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:07,020
it's happening left and right just with

368
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,490
all of the we could have supply chain

369
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,399
vectors people putting chips on things

370
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,490
that we didn't know we were there you

371
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,520
just just expect it right all right

372
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,910
let's talk for a minute about a little

373
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,209
formula that I learned so this formula

374
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:29,260
is the detection time plus the reaction

375
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:33,219
time must be less than the attackers

376
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,620
time to their goal for you to win okay

377
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,839
if it's less if it's greater than if it

378
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,170
takes you longer to detect or to react

379
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,110
to that attacker you're gonna fail so

380
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:46,479
we're all about making them take longer

381
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,520
with active defense where we're trying

382
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,500
to make them take longer to reach their

383
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,569
goal that's the whole point we probably

384
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,330
won't stop them if they're motivated or

385
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,700
a nation-state but most people we can

386
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,410
stop them and make it take longer right

387
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,150
don't make it easy on them so son two

388
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,520
philosophers said that all boy warfare

389
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,459
or cyber warfare is based on deception

390
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,260
hence when we are unable to attack we

391
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,170
must seem unable when we using our

392
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,339
forces we must appear inactive when

393
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,260
we're near we must make the enemy

394
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,379
believe we are far away and one far away

395
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:23,109
with make them believe that we are near

396
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,290
ok these tactics ease warfare tactics

397
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:30,010
they apply to what we're seeing today in

398
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:33,940
our war our battle so if you cannot

399
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,529
detect an insider on your network your

400
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,289
network is not so

401
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:39,720
the days of having a great perimeter and

402
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,039
that's all you need those days are gone

403
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,110
because they hop on a VPN and they're

404
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,510
writing your network or they get

405
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,418
credentials and they're right into the

406
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,059
cloud where all your data is ok so

407
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,510
having a perimeter just doesn't cut it

408
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,129
anymore

409
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,490
we still need a perimeter don't get rid

410
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,779
of your brood still need them but we got

411
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:04,149
to be able to tech insiders most

412
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:06,880
attackers do not practice any kind of

413
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:10,268
defense they're the they're the predator

414
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,159
you're word of the prey ok so they are

415
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,389
coming after us and they're gonna use

416
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,740
the same tools that we use on our

417
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,750
network because they want to get to the

418
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,019
things on our network they're gonna use

419
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,880
Windows or they're gonna use ActiveX or

420
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:23,260
JavaScript or whatever our site is that

421
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,049
they're trying to exploit they need to

422
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,700
run those ok so they have to turn turn

423
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:30,700
off antivirus they have to get rid of

424
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,970
tools also Security's hard they're lazy

425
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,330
they don't want to deal with that so

426
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,740
just know that a lot of these attackers

427
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,779
that are hitting us they don't have any

428
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,610
security ok all right

429
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:47,320
there's a concept inactive vents of

430
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,699
poison versus venom so poison is

431
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,740
something that has to be ingested it has

432
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,460
to be it's something that you can like

433
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,529
sit on the shelf it's passive it can be

434
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,779
deadly or have nasty consequences when

435
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:02,169
you ingest poison but they have to take

436
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:04,450
it and ingest it ok think of like the

437
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:07,710
Mandrake poison potion or the drought of

438
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,559
living death from Harry Potter

439
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,860
then on the venom side these are the 3

440
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,960
of 4 Google unforgivable curses that

441
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,399
they talk about in order for these

442
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,659
curses to work you had to have malice

443
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,229
otherwise you just kind of screwed

444
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:26,620
people up but so they're active you're

445
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,269
attacking they're deadly right there's

446
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,250
malice buying it like they did it to me

447
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,539
I'm gonna do it I'm attacked back that's

448
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,860
not what we're talking about we're not

449
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,559
talking about venom we're gonna talk

450
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,168
about poison ok so what are some things

451
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,450
that we can do to poison our network

452
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,220
against attackers we want them to take

453
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,179
their ball and go home we want hurdles

454
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,340
ok so let's take some concepts from the

455
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:50,529
military and warfare

456
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,309
and things like deception subterfuge

457
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:56,789
misinformation how do we make it

458
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:02,408
confusing when they get on our network

459
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:04,690
okay how do we set up traps decoys how

460
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,440
do we use camouflage or smoke screens to

461
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,020
our advantage

462
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,279
maybe mines our claymores guy be careful

463
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,539
I want to blow your own fingers off

464
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:17,020
those so maybe we set up on our network

465
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:20,350
we put pointers directing them where to

466
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,350
go breadcrumbs a little trail of files

467
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,840
or accounts or things that maybe we even

468
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,580
open doors for them as they come in

469
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,918
they'll just naturally go this way

470
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,500
they're gonna follow these signposts hey

471
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,830
but what if we could actually make them

472
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,750
move to where we wanted to go what if we

473
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,970
could be like these staircases in Harry

474
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,980
Potter where oh you thought you're going

475
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,340
over there but now you're going over

476
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,440
here you start scanning my box now I'm

477
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,689
gonna move you to this subnet and you're

478
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,720
locked in over here and you have access

479
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,490
to hardly anything right start thinking

480
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,380
about these kind of concepts also traps

481
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,510
if you were gonna walk through a

482
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,270
minefield how differently would you

483
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,710
behave as an attacker if you need to get

484
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,299
to that target you got to go through a

485
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,100
minefield you're gonna be a lot more

486
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:07,720
deliberate a lot more careful you're

487
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:12,520
slow them down okay

488
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,140
it's that detection time and the that we

489
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,770
got to get to the our goal before they

490
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,890
get to theirs

491
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:24,010
okay so smoke screens maybe a little

492
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:27,070
more effective than that but the

493
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,860
military uses smoke when they want to

494
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,689
move when they want to move they use it

495
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,270
offensively and defensively

496
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,640
it could also be used to signal for

497
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,520
exfiltration or a target they throw

498
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,130
smoke out there so we need to use smoke

499
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,710
to kind of hide what we're really doing

500
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,779
what if you're slack or your email is

501
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,250
part of the compromised and the

502
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,740
attackers are watching everything you're

503
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,169
saying about the incident in your slack

504
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,440
your email right do you have an

505
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,929
out-of-band method to communicate think

506
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,550
about how we can hide what we're trying

507
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,740
to do from the attackers

508
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:06,850
and segmentation works great for this

509
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,370
kind of stuff also security through

510
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,899
obscurity this one this one I used to

511
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,250
look at this and be like yeah secure you

512
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,690
through obscurity that's stupid that

513
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,080
doesn't work actually it's very

514
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:19,330
effective it's slowing them down

515
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,870
think about Where's Waldo okay if you

516
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,860
had to pick a server out of the hundred

517
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:29,500
servers that look like garbage it's

518
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,840
gonna be a lot harder to do security

519
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,550
through obscurity can work to slow them

520
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,370
down it cannot be the only thing you do

521
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:40,629
you got to do all the other things okay

522
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:42,879
but it can be effective if you're a red

523
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,480
teamer and you come into a network that

524
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,270
it just looks like garbage you're gonna

525
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,890
cry you're gonna you're gonna cry lots

526
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,200
of tears and those tears from red

527
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,540
teamers make the finest wine okay that's

528
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:01,140
a quote directly from John strand so so

529
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,220
if we can use subterfuge and

530
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,190
misinformation what if we put things

531
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,410
like when you're doing OSINT when you're

532
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,150
doing recon on a company one of the

533
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,090
first places you do is you go to google

534
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,670
type of the company do who is doing

535
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,530
LinkedIn start looking LinkedIn is rife

536
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,750
with information like we got people to

537
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,520
put hey I'm a sysadmin over at such a

538
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,190
such company and I know Active Directory

539
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,470
and I know exchange and I know oh 365

540
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,500
and and now you know all the technology

541
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,550
that they use at that company so if you

542
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,490
ever thought about putting some fake

543
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:36,159
profiles out on LinkedIn first this

544
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,890
admin or an intern that doesn't know

545
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,120
better put some fake information

546
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,730
misinformation out there

547
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,189
fake DNS entries to interesting servers

548
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,410
put those on your network try to get

549
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,500
people to go off down a rabbit hole and

550
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:56,530
waste their time okay don't make it easy

551
00:23:50,500 --> 00:24:00,640
so if I give you a list of servers can

552
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:03,310
you find which ones are critical just by

553
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,150
looking at the names and I've seen these

554
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,950
in my career people name their servers

555
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:12,490
UT fen serve zero one

556
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,960
Jenkins 5 - when I can learn a lot just

557
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,740
by looking at the hosts

558
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,590
of a box right first ones a finance

559
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:24,309
server in Utah one of many it's a one

560
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:27,250
that must have a no to right app servers

561
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:31,418
running 2016 are two web server running

562
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:35,350
Debian Marketing tableau oh four it's a

563
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:36,760
cluster right Utah firewall of one main

564
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:43,178
firewall they probably have more than

565
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:44,379
one a pack VPN oh three asia-pacific see

566
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,049
how much information you can get just

567
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,419
from the name and where your targets are

568
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:52,210
so why do we do this why do we name our

569
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:54,640
things why don't we use things like use

570
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,179
planets name your server Centauri your

571
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,529
use Bill and Ted references call it

572
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:05,140
Rufus as your file server or Snoopy or

573
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:08,020
red five I don't know pick some sci-fi

574
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,880
thing that all the geeks know and they

575
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,299
know which server it is they log into

576
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,350
Snoopy every day right but let's not

577
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:19,270
make it easy on attackers okay a couple

578
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,709
of things there's a product I'm gonna

579
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,330
get into a few little tools here they

580
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,860
use sis Mon this is by sysinternals and

581
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,000
sysinternals gobble up by Microsoft and

582
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,850
everybody thought they were gonna go the

583
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,130
way the dodo but they left him alone for

584
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:37,570
the most part sysinternals has been a

585
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:39,010
great batch of tools there's one called

586
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,600
system on if you're not using this on

587
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,210
your windows service please go check it

588
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,480
out but it lets you do all sorts of

589
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,000
monitoring of network connections

590
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,690
processes kick it out to logs and then

591
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,740
snarf those up in your sim another tool

592
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,840
it's called app Locker

593
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,630
it's crazy effective it comes as part of

594
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,510
Windows and basically it's a GPO that

595
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,520
you turn on and you can do it by file

596
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,549
path you can do it by a program name you

597
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,980
can do it by md5 hash to whitelist or

598
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:13,360
blacklist applications from earning on

599
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:15,700
on your servers a couple of things in

600
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,469
your laughs why don't you create a rule

601
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,830
that just automatically brought blocks

602
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,240
nikto or a kinetics or burp why why do

603
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,830
you need to allow those things to come

604
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,570
in through your laughs just block them

605
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:31,699
and watch them cry and cry

606
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,700
about why they can't connect you're like

607
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,550
they don't think about this stuff they

608
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,530
don't think to change the agents train

609
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,690
they just use the defaults and they go

610
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:48,540
right through here's a little script

611
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,690
written in bash of course where

612
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,790
basically I call scan to ban but if you

613
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,560
run the script in a screen it will sit

614
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:59,190
there and listen on your network

615
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,350
connection and anything sent to port you

616
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,880
make it whatever anything sent to port

617
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,760
because I'm likely added to a block list

618
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,580
n IP tables you want to watch a red tree

619
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,500
the red team cry themselves to sleep at

620
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,070
night start blocking them whenever they

621
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,680
scan you just turn this on okay now take

622
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,439
this script use it if you want to make

623
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,810
it cool like add some logic in there to

624
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,000
say okay well I don't just want one port

625
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,149
let's say if they hit ten port sort of

626
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,490
50 ports or whatever then Adam or let's

627
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,130
only run it at a certain time or just go

628
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,040
crazy add it is a as a cron job or a

629
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,660
screen maybe even go in and make it so

630
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,980
your necess canner doesn't trigger this

631
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,150
you don't want to lock yourself out but

632
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,380
think about the things that we can do to

633
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:49,770
make their lives miserable

634
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,480
okay also honey pots there's some good

635
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,850
ones out there kippo is now called

636
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,610
calorie or car I heard it pronounced

637
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,490
both ways but this is a really good

638
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,879
honey pot you can run it in a docker you

639
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,230
can get people to connect in the smart

640
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,060
ones will learn pretty quick that

641
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,740
they're in a honey pot but now by now

642
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,270
they've very triggered right you're you

643
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,500
should be monitoring your honey pots

644
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,690
don't just set them out there like

645
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,990
actually have them send logs and alerts

646
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:20,910
back to your sim if you don't have a sim

647
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:22,530
use email something one cool thing is

648
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,480
that they stay logged in they have even

649
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,740
after they think they've left on some of

650
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,630
these script kiddies that don't know

651
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,980
better they think they've logged out but

652
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,300
they're not really logged out you can

653
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,700
sit there and watch them try and connect

654
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,800
other servers and now you can see what

655
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,720
what else might be compromised on your

656
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,210
network they're trying to get to right

657
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,490
it's really good

658
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,320
honey tokens there's an open

659
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,570
source tool called open canary this is

660
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,300
exactly the same as the thing store

661
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,740
thinkest canary that you can buy for

662
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,720
lots of money but they have an

663
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,330
open-source version just doesn't have a

664
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,520
GUI but it has all the infrastructure in

665
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,010
sprinkle canary tokens throughout your

666
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,600
network set these up these things will

667
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,270
Beacon Hill tell you when things it's

668
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,250
it's also great for DLP and attribution

669
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,020
at least tell you that something's gone

670
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,590
it's a little alarm bell that goes off

671
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,200
okay honey accounts this one's free and

672
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,090
easy and cheap go into active directory

673
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,530
create some accounts to have access to

674
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,840
zip to nada

675
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,450
even go in and turn their logon hours to

676
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,520
nothing never and leave them there and

677
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,130
then go into your Sam and say if fred

678
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,830
flintstone ever gets logged in to send

679
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,610
me an alert an even an attempted login

680
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:34,230
all right this is easy cheap it might be

681
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,879
the warning that you need that someone's

682
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,090
on your network and trying to do a spray

683
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,559
and pray password spraying across the

684
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:46,320
network also honey records you could put

685
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,428
these in a database set up alerting on

686
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,010
them you can even set up a stored

687
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,770
procedure that alerts when an record

688
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:57,600
gets accessed another tool i want to

689
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:59,250
mention is called honey badger so a few

690
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,389
years ago google gotten a lot of hot

691
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,340
water because they were running around

692
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,380
with her google vans or street view and

693
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,860
they were snarf enough SSIDs

694
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,340
and everybody was freaking out okay

695
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,469
so google said okay fine we'll stop we

696
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,760
won't do it anymore well guess what they

697
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,170
don't need vans anymore because

698
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,110
everybody carries one of these in their

699
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:22,230
pocket and these things when you turn on

700
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,809
device location and tracking they phone

701
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,230
home tell google where you're at and

702
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,820
here are the SS ids all around me okay

703
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,440
so as we're sitting here in this

704
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,600
conference your phones are pinging back

705
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,210
to google saying there's a saint con

706
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,059
network and they know the geolocation of

707
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,870
where that saint con network is don't

708
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,460
use a Google phone it does it on Apple -

709
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,050
it's not just Google it's everybody

710
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,790
everybody's doing this marketers love

711
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,559
this stuff they want to know where

712
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,940
everybody is at all times and who you

713
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,450
are

714
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,550
what age and demographic everything

715
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,350
about you so they can market you okay

716
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,470
they're using these technologies to

717
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:03,159
market well let's use these technologies

718
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:05,600
to track people and get attribution so

719
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,700
the honey badger is really cool because

720
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,699
if you have a Google API you can just go

721
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,310
sign up on Google and get access to the

722
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,880
API and it will give you within a three

723
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:19,280
meter radius of where someone is okay

724
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:25,030
especially if you've got tokens hooked

725
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,040
up as well this one's kind of fun so in

726
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:31,760
Microsoft world you can create

727
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,139
directories that link to themselves so

728
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,750
if you want to really mess with der

729
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,750
Buster there's some of these other tools

730
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,270
that are crawlers through an OS just

731
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,830
make a directory that recursively points

732
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,230
back to itself then another one that

733
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,510
points to that and they will just get in

734
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,100
a loop and a lot of times these guys

735
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,540
just they just run a little tool and

736
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,280
they they're like yeah it's gonna take

737
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,750
eight hours I'm gonna hit the hay and

738
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,550
they come back and they're just sitting

739
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,640
there in a loop and they haven't even

740
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:00,379
noticed anything okay

741
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,140
be careful with this it could break your

742
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,930
AV but one thing I would love Dustin to

743
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,940
know about ransomware I'm assuming when

744
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,380
you get ransomware on your machine it

745
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,570
either starts at the beginning their end

746
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,160
of the drive and it starts encrypting if

747
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:19,040
it hits this directory and tries to

748
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:25,390
encrypt it might stop it right someone

749
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:29,300
test that for me so um we had a website

750
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,580
pop up that somebody basically went out

751
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,379
to our website scraped the whole thing

752
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,970
and stood up a new domain and through

753
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:40,240
our website up there and it looked just

754
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:44,360
like ours I had the logo had everything

755
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,570
they even hotlinked the images from our

756
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,629
server for theirs so they don't have to

757
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,460
host them right so what you could do

758
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,830
with this is you could make an image or

759
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:58,160
even a pixel and hide it that's on your

760
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:00,260
box and somebody copies your site puts

761
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,250
it up over here you get a little alert

762
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,290
hey that's not coming from your dome

763
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,400
somebody just cloned your site and maybe

764
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,250
you've got an active spearfishing

765
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,410
campaign going against you now a little

766
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:13,170
bit Intel

767
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,910
so speaking of threat Intel um a lot of

768
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,940
people want to sell you threat Intel and

769
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,350
they'll charge you oh man I've heard up

770
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,780
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

771
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,969
for their threat feeds and IP reputation

772
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,220
and theirs is the best and they got all

773
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,720
these sensors around the world well

774
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,950
that's all fun and good but that's not

775
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,700
directed at you

776
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:34,320
those aren't direct threats at you so

777
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,799
the best thing to do is get your own

778
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,389
threat Intel okay a lot of these lists

779
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,490
they're stale they've been out there for

780
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,140
years they don't keep it up-to-date they

781
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,080
don't share because they want to sell it

782
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,270
for lots of lots of money so if you're

783
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,460
getting if you set up an infrastructure

784
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,790
where you are getting your own threat

785
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,890
Intel out from the wild wild west called

786
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,559
dub-dub-dub

787
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:01,740
you can now use that information of

788
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,059
people actually attacking you and you

789
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,500
can block real threats against your

790
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,510
environment what if you set up a threat

791
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,659
Intel environment like this where your

792
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,850
public out on the Internet is your dev

793
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,440
and that's where people are attacking

794
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,989
you're getting all this information and

795
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,619
this threat Intel and you pipe that over

796
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:23,428
and feed it into your actual prod threat

797
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:25,859
Intel system okay use the internet as

798
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:28,050
like your testing ground and then go put

799
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:30,210
that data to use and make sure that

800
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:35,060
there's nothing calling out those IPS

801
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:37,050
from your own infrastructure okay so

802
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,639
let's talk a little bit about some of

803
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:44,760
the blue team pain points that we have

804
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,429
so visibility and transparency so a lot

805
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,179
of times blue teams are info SEC teams

806
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:52,980
they'll get buried in an organization it

807
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,960
can be really hard when you don't have

808
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,869
that transparency at the board level or

809
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,670
the exact level but Information Security

810
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:01,410
is a boardroom discussion if it's not

811
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,670
happening at the board level you're not

812
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,049
going to get the resources that you need

813
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,550
okay so where the info SEC org sits in

814
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,680
an organization can make a huge

815
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:14,410
difference if you're buried under some

816
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,120
some department that is responsible for

817
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,799
implementing all the controls that

818
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,049
you're trying to do and you're sitting

819
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,360
under your peers with the IT team or

820
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,390
with the ops team and you're trying to

821
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,190
get them to do things it's really easy

822
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,529
for that manager to be like yeah you

823
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,290
know what we got infrastructure to deal

824
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,840
with we got features to release we got

825
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,340
to do lights on like yeah we're on time

826
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,260
for this security stuff now if you're in

827
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,230
another department and then it trickles

828
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,520
up to that board level exact level then

829
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,530
they can start having discussions at

830
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,890
that level about what they need to do

831
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,370
it's too easy for one person one leader

832
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:52,990
to just stifle that message that it

833
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:56,109
doesn't trickle up you need that

834
00:35:52,990 --> 00:36:00,040
transparency so I've seen InfoSec about

835
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:05,010
50% of InfoSec departments report to the

836
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:09,100
CIO that's industry standard about 35%

837
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:11,920
report to the CEO and then 15% about

838
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:16,299
report to other another could be a CEO

839
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,120
or general counsel but take a hard look

840
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:22,000
at where InfoSec sits in your org and

841
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,950
whether it's working it might it might

842
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,840
work for you and that may depend on the

843
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,290
personalities of the people involved on

844
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,330
the teams the leaders but if you're not

845
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,730
getting anywhere take a hard look at

846
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,069
where you sit and made me make a play to

847
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,160
move to another org

848
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,810
also to help you get resources a lot of

849
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,480
times if you report up through a CIO

850
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:45,880
through a CFO well guess what the CFO he

851
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,590
cares about money and he's gonna say

852
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,750
well that costs too much and he's just

853
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,100
gonna axe it right right from the get-go

854
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:55,000
you don't even get to have the

855
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:57,069
discussions and then also security is

856
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,410
everyone's responsibility so naturally

857
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,810
everybody has an opinion about security

858
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,730
and when you have an opinion verse in an

859
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,470
opinion whoever's the stronger

860
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:10,920
personality is gonna win if you take

861
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:13,839
data with your opinion you will win okay

862
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,940
so make sure we have that data so how do

863
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,320
I get budget how do I get my execs

864
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:22,360
attention and the way we should we

865
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:25,160
report so first of all avoid FUD a good

866
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,220
good amount of FUD can be helpful but

867
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,819
avoid like being Chicken Little all the

868
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,828
time

869
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:36,200
and InfoSec it can it can backfire and

870
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:38,509
then they start to just view use the

871
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,299
crazy man that always paranoid about

872
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:43,099
everything plan ahead if you're not able

873
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:44,599
to get the resources right now if you're

874
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:48,140
not able to get the money and the people

875
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,630
make a plan so when a crisis happens or

876
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,640
a breach or an incident and they're like

877
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,130
oh man what should we do about that you

878
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,069
could say actually in my back pocket

879
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:01,160
right here I've got a whole plan on how

880
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,869
we can implement XYZ okay so you got to

881
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,598
be prepared because those opportunities

882
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:07,480
will come be ready jump on it actually

883
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,410
shows a lot of professional

884
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,130
professionalism if you're ready to do

885
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,410
that and then also with the with the

886
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,589
risk with the opinion versus data

887
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:21,828
there's something that we implemented

888
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:23,750
called risk scores so executives they

889
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,849
know the language of business they know

890
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,190
the language of risk they don't know

891
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:30,799
InfoSec language they don't know IT

892
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,960
language so we need to learn their

893
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:35,269
language they're not gonna learn ours we

894
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,190
need to learn there's and then also we

895
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:39,859
need to train to not train them up so on

896
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,680
the risk score front one thing we did

897
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,759
was we boiled it down to three bubbles

898
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,460
that they could wrap their head around

899
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:49,970
and we went from one to a hundred and

900
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,500
said hey this is our business risk this

901
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,269
is our product risk and this is our

902
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,819
privacy risk and your your bubbles might

903
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:58,250
might be different but give them a score

904
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:59,808
that they can look at and it's a little

905
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,000
bit more complicated than a stoplight

906
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:03,950
chart but give them something to look at

907
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,140
to say oh that numbers going up but that

908
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,450
numbers going down right give them

909
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,799
something that'll help them because they

910
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:14,029
understand risk they deal with it all

911
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:15,500
the time business risk okay so use

912
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:17,180
something like that to talk to them also

913
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,029
another thing that worked really well

914
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,250
for us was we do Incident Response

915
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:25,609
training for the executives if you have

916
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,920
an IR plan or an IR procedure you should

917
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,839
be practicing that at least a couple

918
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,230
times a year I'd say quarterly if you

919
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:37,460
can get in with your execs and play

920
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:39,170
Dungeons & Dragons okay and take in a

921
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,869
20-sided

922
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:46,349
and some little figurines and nerd out

923
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:49,260
with them for a little bit and put up a

924
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:51,319
scenario walk them through it you're the

925
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,569
dungeon master they're rolling the dice

926
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:56,400
they can have fun and they can learn and

927
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:59,730
you know practice your IR all at the

928
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,260
same time it's really cool one thing we

929
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,359
did is we said okay if you roll one

930
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,849
through ten you failed if you roll

931
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,558
eleven through twenty you succeeded on

932
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,839
that action whatever that was

933
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,460
now if someone's been dot if it's been

934
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,558
documented somewhere in a policy or a

935
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,450
procedure here plus five automatically

936
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,299
boom if somebody's been trained on it

937
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,250
plus three boom so they could get a plus

938
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:21,839
eight on every roll now every so often

939
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,859
because I'm the dungeon master I can say

940
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,058
when I'm minus nine okay because there's

941
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,279
some things you want to move the

942
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:34,020
scenario along you don't want them to

943
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:37,039
just win every time okay another another

944
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,538
thing about that we've tried for

945
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,130
educating our execs and our users is

946
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,980
internal bug bounties maybe create some

947
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:47,250
for like OPSEC create one for product

948
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,000
bugs or privacy actually maybe give him

949
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,829
cash

950
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,039
give him a gift card if they come back

951
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:56,579
with a bug or an issue get your users

952
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,279
that are typing admin admin into

953
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:02,609
everything say if you type at me an

954
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:05,130
admin and a website let us know and

955
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:07,020
we'll give you twenty bucks right and

956
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,309
then we can go fix it put your users to

957
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,309
work okay

958
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,520
see I got a few minutes left so having a

959
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,808
roadmap really helps with your

960
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,240
executives they want to know that you've

961
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,309
got this they want to know they want to

962
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,799
be confident in you and your team and

963
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,970
your abilities so having a roadmap

964
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:29,038
really helps there's one thing we

965
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,450
developed and feel free to take pictures

966
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,170
if you want it's out on the internet as

967
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:35,460
well but executives love this kind of

968
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,779
stuff so if you're going to talk to your

969
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,500
exactly is you got to make pretty slides

970
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:39,960
okay

971
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,589
you have to otherwise they'll just

972
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,869
ignore it so if you take this called

973
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:47,849
spider chart and it might be hard to see

974
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:50,849
but we've got different legs and knee

975
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:52,560
joints on this spider chart and we took

976
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,930
things like privacy compliant

977
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,509
governance defense assessment awareness

978
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,879
monitoring product and as you mature

979
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,860
your program you're gonna start out

980
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,560
cutting that middle section there and

981
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:09,120
you're gonna map and say okay well I

982
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:12,029
have policies and I have a DPA for all

983
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,650
my customers so let me move my that leg

984
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,810
out to there and then what you do is you

985
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,820
just kind of draw lines between those

986
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,940
knee joints and now you see what you

987
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,670
have coverage then you can see where you

988
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,140
have gaps and then we kind of put

989
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,880
different levels in here so if you're a

990
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,490
level one organization maybe you're

991
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,100
doing these things level two you're

992
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,870
doing a little bit more take this modify

993
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,350
it use it for your own orgs show it to

994
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:42,799
your exec so drool all over it having a

995
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:46,940
roadmap is key forgetting that buy-in so

996
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,820
real quick there was a documentary in

997
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,250
1990 it was pretty awesome about a

998
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,370
brazen attack on this soft target okay

999
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,840
that have one defender that's it the

1000
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,720
defender was able to use all the tactics

1001
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,850
that we talked about to thwart these

1002
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,049
attackers so this documentary probably a

1003
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:10,170
lot of you have seen it it was Kevin

1004
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,150
McCallister in home alone he used all

1005
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,670
these tactics that we talked about to

1006
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,210
thwart the Wet Bandits that were trying

1007
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:20,850
to rob his home so this is our house

1008
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,760
just like Kevin we need to know how to

1009
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,610
defend it

1010
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:30,030
so he used smoke screens

1011
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:34,470
he used some tactics right in the face

1012
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:36,810
with an iron blowtorch that might be I

1013
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,730
don't know that might be like a shotgun

1014
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:44,340
I don't know firewall there you go

1015
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:46,620
same with the doorknob and if you

1016
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,200
remember he poured water on those front

1017
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,549
steps that froze right because he didn't

1018
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,960
want them to come in the front door he

1019
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,210
wanted to come around the back door we

1020
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,800
had more defenses in place like lead

1021
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:02,270
your target where you want them to go

1022
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:04,740
and then yeah paint can to the face so

1023
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,030
just kind of wrap up first get your

1024
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,009
house in order do

1025
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,210
the things there there are things that

1026
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,310
we got to do we all know it

1027
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,170
defense-in-depth we've been talking

1028
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:17,070
about less preaching about it for years

1029
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:21,060
remember poison versus venom venom is

1030
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:22,440
illegal don't do it but poison we can

1031
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,390
definitely do and if they come in and

1032
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,730
they drink that poison that is on them

1033
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,529
and put up the warning banners and say

1034
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:33,210
hey we have poison on our network right

1035
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,070
also use these two techniques these

1036
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:38,070
defense techniques we talked about and

1037
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:43,020
then build prepare and if you're able to

1038
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:46,290
build a robust InfoSec program so now go

1039
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:49,140
forth and conquer remember our goal is

1040
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,150
to not make it easy on them we want them

1041
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:54,390
to turn away go through all the hurdles

1042
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,860
that is not worth the effort or that we

1043
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,319
can catch them because that we may can

1044
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,450
take too long to get to their target so

1045
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:05,580
remember let's make blue teams great

1046
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:08,490
again and go forth and spread the gospel

1047
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,500
of the blue team and that is my

1048
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:17,578
presentation

1049
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,579
[Applause]
