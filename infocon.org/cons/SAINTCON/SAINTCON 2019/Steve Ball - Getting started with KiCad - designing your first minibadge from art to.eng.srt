1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:08,129
howdy welcome to my talk on getting

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,019
started with Chi CAD in designing a mini

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:16,619
badge or whatever else you want to

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:20,250
design so to start out with my name is

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,189
hamster I so go by Steve ball and places

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,680
that aren't saint con DEF CON whatnot

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,439
I'm a system engineer by trade

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,150
that's just mostly a fancy way of saying

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,750
that I'm the guy that has to make the

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,559
customer happy with our product so for

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,989
me it's very rewarding and distressing

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,160
to sit down and make these cool little

13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,468
mini badges and bad in other badges so

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,769
this is kind of my passion and my hobby

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,610
and the thing that keeps me up at night

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:56,670
so speaking of mini badges the mini

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,949
badge is a nice little form factor it's

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,920
only about an inch square or 0.8 inches

19
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,009
square it's a fixed form factor unlike

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,770
there's some other formats out there

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,020
like Def Con has popularized the SAO or

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,990
shitty add-on which doesn't really have

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,970
a size associated with it so you end up

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,419
with add-ons that are all kinds of

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,039
different sizes the mini badge has

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,990
usually about this size you can make up

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,580
a little bit bigger but the problem that

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,949
comes is the the boards are really

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,679
designed to use this size so it

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,990
constrains what you can put on there but

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,549
it also is nice that you know it's an

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,140
own form factor you don't have to worry

33
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,570
about power you don't have to worry

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,680
about for most part micro processors you

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,720
don't have to worry about a lot of

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,380
things so it makes it really easy to get

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,579
into designing your first PCB when you

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,960
just need to have something like if you

39
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,380
just want to blinky or something like

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,970
that that it's really easy to hook it up

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,420
and plug it into a badge and not worry

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,369
about all the low level of specifics and

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,439
what this really means is that all of

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,420
you out here can make your own mini

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,689
badge if you can get art into a computer

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,429
you can make a mini badge it's not that

47
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,978
difficult it's just a matter of learning

48
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,580
a couple of things about designing PCBs

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,500
and using the software

50
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,959
so to that end before I go to the next

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,400
slide I've got some prizes up here so

52
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:29,140
anybody know what PCB stands for all

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:33,049
right hopefully they survived

54
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,349
all right so printed circuit board which

55
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:39,040
consists of layers of insulation like

56
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:42,980
fr4 which is a fiberglass insulation

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,590
copper printed graphics one of the weird

58
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,569
things you'll find with boards is that

59
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,060
they like to specify the board size in

60
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:52,160
millimeters but when you get down to the

61
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,709
traces and the spaces it's usually in

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,190
mils which are not millimeters but a

63
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,200
thousandth of an inch some board houses

64
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,690
would do millimeters but almost everyone

65
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,929
designs in mils so a little bit of

66
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,750
confusion there so various components of

67
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,599
the printed circuit board you have vias

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,700
which are the drill holes and the drill

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,709
holes can either be plated or unplayed

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,108
it depending on what application you

71
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,019
have for them usually mounting holes are

72
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:22,760
unplayed 'add things that you need to

73
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,090
basically make a circuit to connect from

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,828
one side of the other will be plated

75
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,180
traces are the thin copper lines those

76
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:35,420
are your wires pores are usually what we

77
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,250
refer to as large areas of copper it's

78
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,220
kind of a misnomer no one's actually

79
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,739
pouring copper on it but it's just the

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,690
nomenclature the board start out

81
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,720
completely covered in copper and then

82
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,389
copper is removed and then finally you

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,639
have on top of that I'm missing it here

84
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,560
you have solder mask that goes on top of

85
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,959
it that prevents solder from getting on

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,569
to some of the copper and then on top of

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,090
that you have the silkscreen so looking

88
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,220
at a two layer stack up here you kind of

89
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,650
get the idea of what it looks like

90
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,579
you've got your core layer and then the

91
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,130
the solder or the copper your vias come

92
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:16,370
through the board you have your solder

93
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,899
mask this covers everything not really

94
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,168
presented here very well as the

95
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,969
silkscreen so this is a two layer board

96
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,349
which means you have copper on the front

97
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:26,070
in the back of the board and this is

98
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,390
pretty typical of moe

99
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,530
boards and most of the boards you're

100
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,440
gonna be making are probably gonna be

101
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,820
two layer boards but that doesn't mean

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,010
you have to limit yourself to two layers

103
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,440
if you have a really complicated design

104
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,210
and you need more space you can just

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,340
keep stacking more layers on to it

106
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,650
you're gonna pay an extra price to go to

107
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,239
more layers but things like the iPhone

108
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,840
it's in your pocket some of those boards

109
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,150
are 16 layer boards so the the

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,900
possibility is there to get more wires

111
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:57,030
into a smaller space as sort of a

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,919
circuit boards themselves there's

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,559
different finishes that you can have on

114
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,700
the circuit board depending on what you

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,050
want it to look like you've seen the

116
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,870
circuit boards of them look silver

117
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,460
somewhat gold that's something you would

118
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,080
specify when you go to order the board

119
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,400
how you want to do it

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,599
OS P is a good gold color but you have

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,320
to be careful with it

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,910
handle it with your hands or if you get

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,290
isopropyl alcohol on it it'll tarnish it

124
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,730
so if you're looking for a tarnished

125
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,800
look like you want to make that

126
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,660
nuka-cola badge this is a good way to go

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,830
hassle is the default because it's

128
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,020
really cheap

129
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,530
basically they dip it in solder of and

130
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,789
blow hot air across it to level it out

131
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:44,130
the Electra Snickle immersion gold is a

132
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,630
little bit more expensive not that much

133
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,550
more expensive and especially if you're

134
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,010
doing large quantities it doesn't add

135
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,740
much to the price and I found that

136
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,810
that's usually the one that does really

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,450
well like it doesn't tarnish it doesn't

138
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,400
stain and it's decently gold color so if

139
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,599
you're looking for that kind of color on

140
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,789
your circuit board that's the one you

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,740
really want to go for different board

142
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,810
houses will offer different things some

143
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,450
of them will be places that only offer

144
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,910
OSP and other places to only offer eunji

145
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,420
so it's really kind of up to you which

146
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,390
way you want to go so printed circuit

147
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,920
boards are the way you design it you end

148
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,370
up with a file format that's called a

149
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,560
Gerber

150
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,030
that's nothing to do with babies trust

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,550
me on this

152
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,140
the it's an ASCII format that describes

153
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,750
the the board's if you're all familiar

154
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,630
kind of with g-code for like your 3d

155
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,410
printers or CNC Mills it feels a lot

156
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,409
like that it was released back in 1980

157
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,409
and we're still using it like there

158
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,569
thing else we're still using it but it's

159
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,629
still working pretty good so it it

160
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:49,249
doesn't have to be terribly complicated

161
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:52,219
printed circuit boards at its core it's

162
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:54,499
just the the Gerber file is describing a

163
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:57,139
set of vectors right so run this point

164
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:59,300
to this point and make it this thick so

165
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,219
anything like when you have any curve

166
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,729
traces on your board that's just a

167
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,899
series of little points so that's why if

168
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,378
you have a board of a lot of artwork

169
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:12,800
it's going to be a lot of kilobytes

170
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:15,289
worth of space so let's talk about

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,389
artwork for a PCBs when you design your

172
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,449
artwork you want to bear in mind the

173
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,999
limitations you're gonna have in getting

174
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,399
this fab dat the board house one of the

175
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:28,669
things that you'll find is that you have

176
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,439
a limited color palette you can use lots

177
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,659
of things to give you slightly different

178
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,610
colors you've got gold or silver for

179
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:37,129
your copper different colors a solder

180
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,809
mask different colors of silkscreen you

181
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,579
can put copper under the solder mask to

182
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:42,249
give you a different tone of solder mask

183
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,499
so you can have like a two-tone effect

184
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:47,269
there's lots of ways that you can get a

185
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:49,579
little bit more color out of it but

186
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:51,019
you're still limited there are some

187
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,209
board houses that are starting to offer

188
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:56,029
the idea of having multicolored

189
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,649
silkscreen there's not many of them that

190
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,610
are doing it and you're probably going

191
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:02,389
to pay a premium

192
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,649
but I do see board houses are probably

193
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,379
gonna be offering that more in the

194
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,089
future I feel that like as the hacker

195
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,860
community grows and we start doing this

196
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,860
kind of stuff especially the Chinese

197
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,399
board houses are really responsive to

198
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,919
that kind of demand when you're making

199
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,229
your design try to simplify it tiny

200
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,429
details that get lost the printed

201
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,919
circuit boards will print really small

202
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:26,808
details but if you get too crazy with

203
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,008
tiny ones you'll get your board in and

204
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:32,539
it'll be all kind of muddled up for

205
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,990
gradients you don't really want to have

206
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,419
gradients in your color since you have

207
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,829
just a couple of colors you can't really

208
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,480
make them greedy ated but you could do

209
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,329
half tones and we'll talk about that in

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,160
a minute

211
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,739
when you're designing your artwork

212
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,310
try to stay in vector as much as

213
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,160
possible and the reason for this

214
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,748
it scales really well and there's a step

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,029
I'll show you in a minute that makes

216
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:02,300
that really critical so if you're

217
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,040
starting out in Photoshop to make your

218
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,660
design try to get it imported into

219
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
illustrator or inks gave being

220
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,110
converting into a vector before you

221
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,569
proceed with getting it into the board

222
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,759
you'll be much happier if you don't know

223
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:16,769
how to use each state Inkscape

224
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,910
or illustrator now it's the time to

225
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:23,999
learn so half-tones

226
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,790
they allow you to simulate gradients by

227
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:28,410
using dots and I am not the greatest

228
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,259
person at half-tones you can see my

229
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,540
horrible Twinkle Twinkle all that well

230
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:37,649
the cassette tape from the DC's Nia

231
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,360
badge turned out a lot better however at

232
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,790
least in kaya CAD when you do a 3d

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,790
render it doesn't like all those little

234
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,670
elements and it really chokes so a lot

235
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,769
of times I won't put the gradient into a

236
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,740
chi cat until almost the last step

237
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,230
otherwise I'm looking at like click the

238
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,740
button update the 3d render and go get a

239
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,990
coke for a little while you know when

240
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,420
you're designing your artwork I work

241
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,029
through illustrator what I like to do

242
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,420
will you want to design your board one

243
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,949
to one so in illustrator you know make

244
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,089
your board so that it like in

245
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,459
Illustrator if you're gonna make your

246
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,500
board an inch tall make it an inch tall

247
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:19,829
and illustrator otherwise you're going

248
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,300
to deal with scaling hell if you just

249
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,040
make it an arbitrary size and

250
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,959
illustrator when you bring it in to Kai

251
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,120
CAD now you've got to like figure out

252
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,369
how to like scale it on import because

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,040
once you get it into Kai CAD you can't

254
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,959
rescale it you can only ask it scale it

255
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,870
on import and it's a lot easier to deal

256
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,429
with scaling here and illustrator I like

257
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,230
to use a separate artboard for each

258
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:43,139
layer so I can see what the stack up

259
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,879
looks like and then for each layer but

260
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,990
you're going to export to go into Kai

261
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:51,569
CAD keep it black and white the importer

262
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,809
in Kai CAD does not support colors it's

263
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:57,540
going to choke on colors or more along

264
00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:00,240
the lines of you can threshold what it

265
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,069
considers black and white so for the

266
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,730
least headaches and to make things look

267
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:06,839
like you expect they're looking make

268
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,850
sure that you just keep it

269
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,800
black-and-white when you're exporting

270
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,350
you would think that you'd go like 300

271
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,800
dpi go far higher than that

272
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,410
I usually go 1200 to 2400 dpi the reason

273
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,180
for this is you're coming out of

274
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,209
illustrator as a vector into a raster

275
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,760
format and the Chi cat importer converts

276
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,460
raster back into the gerber vector

277
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,270
format so if you don't have really high

278
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,950
DPI kikes ad is going to basically round

279
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,530
off all your corners you can see in the

280
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:43,500
example images here how I lost sharpness

281
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,470
by going with lower dpi so this is a

282
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,390
really critical state step to getting

283
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:53,820
really clean imports into kikes add new

284
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,920
versions of plugins are coming out all

285
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,500
the time for Kai CAD there's some stuff

286
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,680
out there now but allows you to import

287
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,390
SPG's natively into kai cad but there's

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,770
still a little crunchy they're not quite

289
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:09,630
ready for primetime I don't think also

290
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,880
when you're designing an illustrator you

291
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,470
can design your board outline so you can

292
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,330
make the actual outline of what you want

293
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,790
the board to look like well when you're

294
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,730
designing an illustrator it's going to

295
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,819
make curves I can't can't handle any

296
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,710
curves on the DXF import so what you're

297
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,840
gonna have to do there is basically zoom

298
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,660
in to the path that you want to be the

299
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,020
board outline add a bunch of control

300
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,800
points and then go in and simplify the

301
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,480
curve to straight lines so then when you

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,150
bring it into kiya cat it won't choke on

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,860
it otherwise Kai cattle ever not import

304
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,650
it or it'll only import the straight

305
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,290
lines and you'll get lots of gaps you

306
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,110
can do the outline itself in Chi CAD if

307
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,670
you don't want to deal with this step

308
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,370
but sometimes I'm more complicated

309
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,979
boards it's useful to make the outline

310
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,920
in Illustrator we can make it like an

311
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,320
offset of your design or something

312
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,380
so we're speaking a little bit about a

313
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,410
kike add here a kike cat has been around

314
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,710
since 1992 it's an open-source platform

315
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:17,130
for developing boards it covers both

316
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:20,640
schematic capture and board design it

317
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,170
has a 3d preview and it's very actively

318
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,620
developed there's a lot of good features

319
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,089
in here I have come to kike ad from

320
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,430
using all TM and using eagle and Kai

321
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,470
Cadiz might go to for designing boards

322
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,510
and especially dealing with artwork it

323
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,100
does really well with designing nice

324
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:43,290
artwork and earlier this year the first

325
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,910
kite CAD con was held in Chicago so

326
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,980
there's a lot of excitement around Kai

327
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,439
CAD and I I feel as we go forward we're

328
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,540
gonna find neat plugins coming out to

329
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,320
help improve this process of doing

330
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,910
artistic PCBs so the first step of

331
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,070
bringing stuff in the Kai cat is you

332
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,910
want to design your schematic and this

333
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:05,010
call it schematic capture the you don't

334
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,319
really want to skip this step even if

335
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,900
you have a simple PCB that's just like

336
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,520
an LED and a resistor and the the

337
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,980
connector for the mini badge or whatnot

338
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,980
do your schematic because it's going to

339
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,890
help you later when you do DRC if you

340
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,090
skip this step then deer's VAR c it's

341
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,100
not going to work for you later

342
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,060
the everything you should get in the

343
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,370
habit of when you're doing your

344
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,050
schematic is keep it neat like clean it

345
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,380
up make sure you have things laid out

346
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,719
nice when you're doing something really

347
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,220
simple it may be easy to overlook that

348
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
step but as you get into more

349
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,240
complicated circuits it's just right

350
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,830
just like writing code you can write

351
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,510
some spaghetti code today that works

352
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,700
when you come back to it from six months

353
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,100
from now and you're like who is the

354
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,440
moron it wrote this code same thing

355
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:58,080
happens when you're designing your your

356
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,970
schematic so it's import into Kai CAD it

357
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,910
has an importer utility which you

358
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,860
basically just point it to what image

359
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,620
you want to import it will automatically

360
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,120
detect the scaling information so it

361
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,430
will take care of all that for you if

362
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,380
you didn't scale correctly this is the

363
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,239
box that you're going to be entering in

364
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,390
how to scale things you're going to

365
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,400
match one dpi to another dpi so again

366
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:24,150
one to one and it's a way to go for less

367
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,189
headaches here don't worry too much

368
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,829
about what layer your stuff ends up on

369
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,550
either put it on the front silk screen

370
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:35,149
or the the front solder mask for now

371
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,250
we'll move it around later

372
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:40,560
after you get it imported then you can

373
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,940
open it in the footprint editor and you

374
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,268
can move things around into different

375
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,699
layers you can choose to make your your

376
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,800
footprint for your artwork either be a

377
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,149
stack up of all your art or you can have

378
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,069
it broken out into individual pieces

379
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,170
like here's my copper footprint here's

380
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:58,500
my silkscreen footprint it's really up

381
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,599
to you how you want to stack this up one

382
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,970
thing that I will mention on solder mask

383
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,490
if you have an area that you want to be

384
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,339
clear copper you need to put a solder

385
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,370
mask shape over a top of it in order to

386
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,259
expose that copper by default on a board

387
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,810
they're going to put solder mask over

388
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,089
the entirety of a board so any shape

389
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,709
that you put on the solder mask as a

390
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,410
negative shape and that's going to be

391
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:24,689
the cutout so if you had like a solid

392
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,310
copper pour and you had a cutout that

393
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:28,170
had your handle on it when you get the

394
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,939
board back you're gonna see your handle

395
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,699
and copper so that's how you get that

396
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:34,889
effect this is also important if you're

397
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,870
doing like an LED bleed through where

398
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,550
you're bleeding through an LED through

399
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,709
the board like on the the st. conn badge

400
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,930
where all these lights are backlit

401
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,969
that's how that's done is you have to

402
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,310
remove the solder mask and the copper

403
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,069
and then you just have the bare fr4

404
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,649
which is transmitted of two LED light

405
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:55,050
and depending on how thick you get the

406
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,300
the PCB board which is an option when

407
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,008
you buy it it'll either be brighter or

408
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,559
more diffuse so in your schematic once

409
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,329
you're done with your schematic you'll

410
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,209
go through one step where you'll sociate

411
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:13,379
footprints two parts so you've got a

412
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,740
symbol for an LED but what is that a no

413
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,289
603 1206 this is a step where you

414
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,559
physically associate this symbol as this

415
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:24,658
part if you're used to Eagle Eagle is

416
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,099
more of a heavy symbol sort of thing

417
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:28,319
where you bring in a symbol that's both

418
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,120
the symbol in the footprint Chi CAD is

419
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,039
more of a light symbol or the symbol and

420
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,379
the footprint don't necessarily go

421
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,210
together initially you add them together

422
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,580
at the end so you can have a single

423
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,280
symbol and multiple footprints associate

424
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,539
with that just this is a step that

425
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,668
you'll have to do you in order to get

426
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,090
their proper footprints to come into the

427
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:51,120
board editor and your board editor

428
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,790
you'll create a new new layout import

429
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,500
your parts from your schematic imports

430
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,980
your outline if you made one or creat

431
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,470
your outline import your imported art

432
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,810
and you could just drag it around and

433
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,580
place it on the board I've seen some

434
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,040
people that will make art that they'll

435
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,350
add some registration marks that are

436
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,080
outside the board outline so that you

437
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,260
can line up for registration marks I

438
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,689
haven't really had much issue with

439
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,180
designing or stacking my art up without

440
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,660
registration marks so it's really kind

441
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,490
of up to you

442
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,350
the next piece of it is you want to

443
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,000
solve your rat's nest so initially

444
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,179
you're going to get these little ghost

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,420
lines on the screen that are where kikes

446
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,910
ad from this schematic knows that this

447
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,340
pad needs to hook to this pad so your

448
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,260
goal and this is the Zen part of

449
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,570
designing circuit boards as far as I'm

450
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,820
concerned is going in and solving the

451
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,760
rats like moving like drawing the traces

452
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,800
making them all needs or whatever you

453
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,820
want to do of them you can do some more

454
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,040
art in the traces usually the traces

455
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,550
only support straight lines or angle

456
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,100
lines you can do rounded lines in Chi

457
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:08,940
cab by making little steps so it's

458
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,740
entirely possible to do all so here

459
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,500
you're going to want to pay attention to

460
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,080
your trace in space and that means how

461
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,530
fat the traces are and how far apart the

462
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,260
traces are most board houses six mil is

463
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,840
their standard for what they'll support

464
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,430
if you can get smaller than that some

465
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,300
board houses will go down to like three

466
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,770
mil or so

467
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,320
but you're gonna pay a premium for that

468
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,940
I recommend that when you design your

469
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,030
boards go into kikes add and configure

470
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,180
it for the minimum tray size you want to

471
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:42,750
pay for usually I set it to six to seven

472
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,490
mil that way when I'm designing the what

473
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,810
I'm laying out to trace is Kai CAD will

474
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,310
automatically come up and give me

475
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,669
collision warnings so that I know that

476
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,429
hey I've made it too close here or

477
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,650
prevent me from doing something stupid

478
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,540
when you design your artwork if you have

479
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,000
a large copper poor or anything copper

480
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,530
in your artwork Tyco hat doesn't

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,690
consider that when it's doing it

482
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,210
your seat checks so that means you can

483
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,610
put a trace or a via right into your

484
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,250
copy of your art and short it out and

485
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,229
kikes ad can't detect that currently so

486
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,940
just be cognizant of that when you're

487
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,580
when you're designing your board that if

488
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,130
you have copper copper pores especially

489
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,060
in your artwork make sure that you're

490
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,590
doing the right thing and not

491
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,149
accidentally shorting out half of your

492
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:30,300
board by using a copper pore finally run

493
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,580
DRC on your board this is the design

494
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,260
rules check it's just one option you

495
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,490
click on it it'll go through your board

496
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,500
and you'll tell you hey these things are

497
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,000
too close or you've got a footprint

498
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,310
overlapping another footprint are you

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,590
sure you want to proceed and you'll get

500
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,690
a feel for what DRC errors you can live

501
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,639
with what what you're actually going for

502
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,080
maybe you want that battery box to be

503
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,930
over the top of some parts and that's

504
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,060
okay but DRC will save your bacon in a

505
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,290
lot of ways it'll tell you hey you have

506
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,929
something shorted or you have something

507
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,700
to close and this will save you a lot of

508
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,960
costly mistakes where you send out a

509
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,060
board and you get it back in and you

510
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,720
realize ah I didn't hook up that ground

511
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,520
plane to anything DRC will say hey you

512
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,820
forgot the ground plane so trust me this

513
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:16,920
is very important the last thing you

514
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,060
want to do is export it to a gerber the

515
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,060
board house that you're going through

516
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,500
will likely have a how to they'll likely

517
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,409
have some pages that are like hey if

518
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,480
you're using Kai CAD you do it this way

519
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,220
some board houses will take Kai CAD

520
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,580
files natively you can send them your

521
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,570
Kai CAD file and they can deal with it I

522
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,460
personally feel a little squeamish about

523
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,889
sending out my actual source design

524
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,110
files to a fab I prefer to send them

525
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,980
Gerber files because it makes it harder

526
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,669
for someone to reverse engineer

527
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,680
something that I did but it really

528
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,600
depends on what you want to do plus I

529
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,940
know with Gerber files that when I send

530
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,280
one of them out that I know what I

531
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,110
wanted it to look like I know exactly

532
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,240
how I want it to be so I don't have to

533
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,070
argue with them about well and Kai CAD

534
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,550
make sure you select this option right

535
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,990
for like tinting vias or something

536
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,060
always make sure that you check your

537
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,760
Gerber before you send it out kai cat

538
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,770
has a Gerber viewer there's good review

539
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,780
errs online where you can import the

540
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,799
Gerber layers and you can verify hey

541
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,080
this looks right or

542
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,309
something messed up here I find a lot of

543
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,120
times this is really useful for

544
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,918
verifying my silkscreen I'll look at the

545
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,899
silkscreen and I'll discover oh I put a

546
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,120
reference designator under apart that's

547
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,770
never going to work so it allows me to

548
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,178
come back and make sure that I got that

549
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,799
the way I want it to be when you order

550
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:38,649
your boards you might consider getting

551
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,899
panels made there's some open-source

552
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:43,059
tools I've got a link to one here that's

553
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:43,959
called a PC beep analyzer and or a

554
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,570
Gerber panelizer

555
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,700
that allows you to take your individual

556
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,678
design to panel them I've got a couple

557
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,380
of examples of some panels that I've had

558
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,330
made here so the nice thing about doing

559
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,580
panels like this is that you have

560
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,590
multiple designs on one panel and a lot

561
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,658
of board houses will allow you to run

562
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,809
this as though it was a single circuit

563
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:06,460
board for keeper some board houses will

564
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,830
charge you more for panels it really

565
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,120
kind of depends but the nice thing is is

566
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,789
when you get one of these in if you

567
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:17,770
ordered a solder mask or a silkscreen

568
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:20,230
which I say here a stencil for your

569
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,658
solder paste when you put this down you

570
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,370
can stencil this whole board at once so

571
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,679
basically you can put your solder paste

572
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,600
on six of these guys at a time place

573
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,029
them all and do six of them at a time so

574
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,199
you do them one by one so if you're

575
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,149
doing you know

576
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,520
a hundred and fifty of these for DEFCON

577
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:37,840
or something it definitely helps speed

578
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,879
up the process so that you're not

579
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:46,689
spending your entire summer soldering

580
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:48,010
things up so ordering boards these are

581
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,179
some of the typical options that you'll

582
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:54,429
see as long as your boards are less than

583
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,860
100 millimeters square you can usually

584
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,270
get their proto price a lot of the board

585
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,949
houses especially the Chinese born

586
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,350
houses offer this for less than five

587
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,149
dollars you can get 10 100 millimeter

588
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,639
square boards for five dollars plus

589
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:09,250
shipping a lot of the shipping options

590
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,110
they have is like DHL for about twenty

591
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,610
twenty-five dollars from Shenzhen so

592
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:17,860
that's like two day turnaround for the

593
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,689
for shipping and typically I can get a

594
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,559
board like they'll finish a board in

595
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,179
about three days I've had it entirely

596
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,730
happened where I ordered on a Sunday

597
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,840
night and the following Monday I had the

598
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,370
package in my hand when

599
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:36,939
boards for about 25 30 bucks so it's

600
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,199
definitely worthwhile to go that option

601
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,080
when you're designing this stuff even

602
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,950
with your prototyping I mean even if you

603
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,960
make a mistake

604
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,090
30 bucks isn't the end of a world and

605
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,529
you've learned something and at the very

606
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,029
least maybe you've got a cool design

607
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,659
that you can give out as a coaster

608
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:55,179
who knows right you can play with the

609
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,650
options here to get different effects if

610
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:58,029
you want thinner boards if you want them

611
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,350
to flex a little bit or if you want

612
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,350
fatter boards you don't want them to

613
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,959
flex at all if you want different colors

614
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,428
of silkscreen I'm sorry silkscreen a

615
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,010
solder mask this is where you would

616
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:11,380
configure it you may be somewhat limited

617
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:14,020
on your choices unless you pay extra for

618
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,860
some of the colors and choices for

619
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:20,049
instance I use seed a lot they in their

620
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,039
basic option I can choose multiple

621
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:26,679
colors of solder mask but my options are

622
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,870
usually either you get white silkscreen

623
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,370
for all these colors unless it's white

624
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,350
and then you get black silk screen and

625
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,969
that's it unless you want to pay extra

626
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,080
and then you can get crazy with the

627
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,059
color matching a dangerous thing here is

628
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,668
that sometimes an extra hundred boards

629
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,350
is just a couple more bucks and the next

630
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,510
thing you know you've got 1,500 boards

631
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,510
in your cart and they arrive you're like

632
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,850
I'm gonna do all these stupid boards so

633
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,600
it's easy to get carried away with

634
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,760
ordering boards when you go to order

635
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,120
them you've got multiple options for

636
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,850
getting them fabbed the Chinese board

637
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,969
houses are cheap but you're gonna have

638
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,439
to wait for shipping but I mean DHL like

639
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,299
literally I can get a package shipped

640
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,330
out of Shins into my house and about

641
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:15,668
two-and-a-half days that's about as good

642
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,939
as getting it like USPS United States so

643
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:21,669
it's not a huge deal and the price isn't

644
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,950
that bad you can get it slow boat it

645
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,659
from China if you're willing to wait

646
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,659
like three weeks if you want to save

647
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:31,600
like 10 bucks on shipping the quality

648
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:35,500
out of China is pretty good I usually

649
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,840
don't have any issues with it expect

650
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,909
that if there's any questions the the

651
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,820
refrain is usually here with dealing

652
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:44,500
with China's delay one day because

653
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,210
they will ask you a question in middle

654
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,409
of the night and even if you're up in

655
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,470
the middle of the night and you respond

656
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:52,870
instantly I guarantee they won't respond

657
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,279
to you until the next day I don't know

658
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,299
what's going on with that I think that

659
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,399
they're just buying themselves a little

660
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,889
bit of time there but it's just what it

661
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:02,320
is and the final piece of that is

662
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:06,309
language barriers we've all seen like

663
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,110
fun examples of Engrish where they they

664
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:09,940
can say the words and I feel that they

665
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,850
know what they mean but they don't it's

666
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,940
hard to communicate what exactly is

667
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,340
going on I recently had an exchange with

668
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,679
a vendor where I had a board that didn't

669
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,720
have any drill holes in it but I'd

670
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,769
ordered four boards and it was just one

671
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,059
of the board's that didn't have drill

672
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:27,669
holes and they sent me an email about it

673
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:30,428
they're like is it okay to proceed with

674
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:32,289
no punch holes like what is a punch hole

675
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,059
and we went back and forth on it and I

676
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:38,590
finally discovered it oh they mean just

677
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:41,918
this one board and it worked out but hey

678
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,139
it can be fun in the United States ash

679
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,139
Park is a great option if you like

680
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:50,860
purple PCBs they have a new option for

681
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:53,549
after dark which is a black with a clear

682
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,799
solder mask which is a really neat look

683
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:59,500
and it's a fairly reasonable price

684
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,379
they'll give you like three copies of

685
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,750
your design for like I want to say $5

686
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:06,639
per square inch which isn't bad it's

687
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,990
more expensive than a Chinese places but

688
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:13,928
it's a pretty quick turnaround as far as

689
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,570
assembly you can have the fabs symbol

690
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,399
your stuff for you you send them a pick

691
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,889
and place file that Chi CAD generates

692
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,408
that tells them where to place the parts

693
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:26,918
you send out a bomb your bill of

694
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:29,200
materials to basically say this is the

695
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,320
parts that I want to go on there and

696
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,740
have them do all the work and you end up

697
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,450
with finish boards but that can get

698
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,370
pricey there's going to be a setup fee

699
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,740
there's going to be a fee per part place

700
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,860
you got to pay their part cost on the

701
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:49,000
parts unless you send them parts which

702
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:51,789
has its own issues so if you're doing

703
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,019
like a thousand boards you probably want

704
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:55,360
to get them fabbed because you don't

705
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:56,350
again want to waste your summer trying

706
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,780
to like

707
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,330
sitting under a microscope with a pair

708
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,470
of tweezers but by the same token if

709
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,510
you're doing something simple you're

710
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,770
doing a few of them considered just

711
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,879
doing it by hand it's really not that

712
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:12,370
bad the process I use for these guys i

713
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,440
solder paste I place the components by

714
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,049
hand and I have a twenty five dollar

715
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,730
black & decker griddle that I put them

716
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,260
on the griddle turn the griddle all the

717
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,200
way up and wait until the solder flows

718
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,320
and it works great so it's not that

719
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,799
painful to that end I would also suggest

720
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,149
that if you're scared of doing surface

721
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:36,700
mount do surface mount it is way easier

722
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:39,429
than doing through-hole and all aspects

723
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,159
it's smaller parts I know that that's

724
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:44,710
intimidating you can get like 1206 Oh 8

725
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,380
Oh 5s which are reasonable sized parts I

726
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,260
find even oh four oh twos are easy to

727
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,700
work with now if you go and do the

728
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,490
surface mount solder challenge

729
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,260
downstairs where rushan is using a 102 s

730
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:00,159
now that's not something I would

731
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,780
recommend that's like dust sized but the

732
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,820
nice thing about surface mount is you

733
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,000
apply your paste you stick your

734
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,039
components on and you heat it up the

735
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,970
surface tension of the solder will

736
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,350
adjust the location of the parts you

737
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,690
can't see on here but I have a

738
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,389
microcontroller of it in this little

739
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,000
square here is a twenty pin part it's a

740
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,340
qfn 20 pin four sided part with a solder

741
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,850
pad in the middle and I griddle these

742
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,908
and have no failures so the solder paste

743
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,289
will flow into the right place and the

744
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,539
solder mask will keep it out of the

745
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,129
places it shouldn't be and you have very

746
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:38,799
little cleanup to do afterwards it is

747
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:41,470
really nice

748
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,408
speaking of the sourcing parts you have

749
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,880
multiple options for getting your parts

750
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,289
Aliexpress is a good place for getting

751
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,610
parts if you have a time and you're

752
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:53,289
willing to risk it I have had before I

753
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,570
order some battery boxes off of

754
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,370
Aliexpress and I made sure I got the

755
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,439
ones that had the polarity that I wanted

756
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:02,139
and they arrived and I discovered I had

757
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,320
now had completed boards and a hundred

758
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:08,620
battery boxes with the reverse polarity

759
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,178
so I now have a lot of battery boxes so

760
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,678
anyone needs battery boxes

761
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:16,119
I'm your battery box guy now there's

762
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,279
some other options if you want to get

763
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,439
even cheaper than Aliexpress there is

764
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,240
some Chinese options that if you know a

765
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,490
little bit of mandrian you can get

766
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,340
through and get even cheaper options but

767
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:31,029
yeah that's hit or miss and you usually

768
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:33,668
need a guide there if you need your

769
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:36,190
Aliexpress parts quicker someone on

770
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:38,710
Amazon is probably selling them with the

771
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,169
prime markup so if you're willing to pay

772
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,659
you know five times the cost but you can

773
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:47,409
get it tomorrow that's an option for you

774
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:49,929
the tried-and-true options is the digit

775
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:52,919
Keys mousers they do a pretty good job

776
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:55,840
they have pretty much everything they

777
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,460
you'll get used to price breaks where if

778
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,110
you buy one of something it's a dollar

779
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,330
but if you buy a hundred of something

780
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,860
then they're like 20 cents apiece so

781
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,509
there's a you kind of have to play with

782
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,668
a scale a little bit and again it's like

783
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:08,350
the PCBs when you order them it's like

784
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,090
well I don't need a thousand resistors

785
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,668
but it was cheaper than ordering ten of

786
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,428
them those kind of wacky things happen

787
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:17,889
so be cognizant of that there's some

788
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,649
other options out there like arrow arrow

789
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:22,360
is kind of an oddball they have weird

790
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,529
specials from time to time like last

791
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,869
year they had a thing where it's like

792
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:29,190
order anything over ten dollars and will

793
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:31,439
overnight it to you it's like for free

794
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,179
okay I'll do that

795
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,429
let's see two years ago they had a thing

796
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,970
where if you bought more than $40 apart

797
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:42,159
they'd tack on a free raspberry pie so I

798
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,259
ordered $200 worth of parts and separate

799
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,330
orders and I now and the king of

800
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:52,480
raspberry pies the if you're fab is

801
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:54,070
going to assemble it usually it's best

802
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,249
to let them source the parts they

803
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,658
usually have fairly decent prices and

804
00:32:57,249 --> 00:33:01,749
they have the connections with their

805
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:03,220
vendors if you decide to send them parts

806
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,889
like let's say for instance you get in

807
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,450
on a group buy for a microprocessor

808
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:10,149
which is totally something that happened

809
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,309
to me this last year I could get micro

810
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:13,719
processors for $10 a piece or I went

811
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,299
into this group buy and I got them for

812
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,590
$5 a piece because in a group buy were

813
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,139
able to buy a thousand of them but I

814
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,759
just needed 75 of them well then I had

815
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:22,870
to turn around and mail these processors

816
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,380
to China

817
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:29,770
and it's the most amazing thing it costs

818
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:33,010
me $25 to DHL overnight stuff from

819
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,780
Shenzhen but if I DHL into China that

820
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,900
same delivery would be like a hundred

821
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:42,310
and fifty dollars I chose in this

822
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:45,850
instance to go with the about $80 USPS

823
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:48,669
service and they attempted to do the

824
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:51,189
delivery in China on a Sunday when the

825
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,850
fab was closed and then they refused to

826
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,920
redeliver

827
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,530
so I had to convince someone at the fab

828
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,510
to drive an hour from the fab to the

829
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,340
post office to pick up a package but

830
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,930
they could complete my board order it

831
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,620
worked out I can't believe it worked out

832
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:10,480
but that's some of the fun stuff but

833
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:16,600
you're going to deal with let's see here

834
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:24,090
and that's about it so anyone have any

835
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:27,040
questions sure to create a solder mask

836
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,360
it's the same thing that you would do

837
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,810
for creating any of your ever artwork

838
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,810
let me see if I care

839
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,399
see there we go so on this screen you

840
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,888
can see I have silkscreen and solder

841
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,620
mask called out solder mask is just a

842
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,179
none of our art layer so what you're

843
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,799
looking at the thing to remember with a

844
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,650
solder mask here is that it being a

845
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,560
negative layer you just got to think as

846
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,900
it being negative so where you have your

847
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:21,840
artwork is where there's not going to be

848
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:24,180
solder mask see I'm saying yes sir yeah

849
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,610
when you go to order them like on my

850
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,680
page here where I have examples it's

851
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,830
hard to see I I know for especially from

852
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,450
back there you can see this area here

853
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,279
where you see the different color dots

854
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,140
kind of on the screen there they usually

855
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,740
have an area where you can specify what

856
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,540
color you want and bear in mind to

857
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,520
that's depending on whether or not you

858
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,150
have copper underneath the solder mask

859
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,610
that will subtly change the tone of the

860
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,370
solder mask and some of the colors like

861
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,310
the the yellow color I don't have an

862
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,589
example here some vendors have a really

863
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,930
good yellow and some vendors have a

864
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,320
yellow that was really well suited to my

865
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:07,859
poop emoji so there's a sliding scale

866
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,560
there had one guy that convinced a board

867
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,600
house to custom make up a pink color for

868
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,500
I think he was making like a pacman

869
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,750
ghost I want to say in the prototype

870
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,280
came out perfect and he ordered his

871
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,710
actual run and they came in and they

872
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,690
were really washed out pink so he had to

873
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,340
go back to the fab and say can you

874
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:30,180
actually remake these because this pink

875
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:32,910
is it quite right so it it is worthwhile

876
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,710
to do some prototypes where you order

877
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,839
some small quantities to get a feel for

878
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,090
a particular vendors you know this is

879
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,790
the standard red color or standard blue

880
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:47,150
color from this vendor any other

881
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,579
questions

882
00:36:47,150 --> 00:37:00,570
all right well I think you all for

883
00:36:50,579 --> 00:37:03,660
coming or sorry I usually use seed

884
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:05,070
they've been pretty good to me I have

885
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,029
talked to some other people that haven't

886
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,950
had as good of experience the thing that

887
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,680
I find was seed is that they tend to

888
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,669
offer a lot of specials and usually when

889
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,020
they offer a special they get swamped so

890
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,700
you kind of got to watch their website

891
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,009
to see what the current special is to

892
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,450
get an idea if if your board is going to

893
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,210
make it in that week time frame or if

894
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,339
it's gonna be a little longer I have

895
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:34,170
some friends that use PCB way and they

896
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:36,180
really like that we did the DC 801 badge

897
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:41,070
with all PCB and that worked out pretty

898
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,960
well it's kind of whatever flavor you

899
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,740
want they're all slightly different like

900
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,380
I tried using I think it was PCB way to

901
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,640
do some panels and I submitted one of

902
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,109
these panels and they came back to me

903
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,578
and said oh you have a panel we're gonna

904
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,279
charge you ten times the price for this

905
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,720
panel or as I went to seed I submitted

906
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,569
to panel and they're like here's your

907
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,029
panel there wasn't any extra charge so

908
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,800
it kind of depends on what you're after

909
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,210
and different board houses will have

910
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:16,660
different options and different colors

911
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:27,730
and so so

912
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:33,430
oh yeah that's a good question depending

913
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:37,210
on the setup fees and whatnot thinking

914
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:40,299
here so on the DC xia badge we did a run

915
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:42,580
a 75 and the board setup fee I'm wanting

916
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,500
to say it was something like a couple of

917
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,779
hundred dollars so it added probably

918
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,780
about ten or twelve dollars to each

919
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:53,040
board for the setup fee and then you had

920
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,780
to also factor in the the component cost

921
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,190
I mean we'd be buying those components

922
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:03,190
elsewhere anyway it's not unreasonable

923
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,350
to have them assembled and sometimes

924
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,360
you'll run into specialist like seed has

925
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,250
been offering a lot of specials lately

926
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,950
for Vella simple five boards for no

927
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,510
setup fee and they have a pretty good

928
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,589
parts catalog where they have really

929
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:20,650
cheap parts that are in stock so it

930
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:23,590
really kind of depends its corners the

931
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,300
scale if you order a thousand of

932
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,830
something it's gonna be a lot cheaper

933
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:34,050
for you've been ordering a hundred or

934
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:34,049
something yes sir

935
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,839
yeah so you're asking about how you

936
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:52,640
creates a stencil the stencil is created

937
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,590
from your solder mask layer so well

938
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,390
there is an actual paste layer I should

939
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,390
say in Chi CAD when you're designing

940
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,670
your board your surface mount parts will

941
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,279
have a paste layer that says leave this

942
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,130
aperture open for of the paste and you

943
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,119
would submit the paste layer to your

944
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:12,470
manufacturer and they would laser cut

945
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,970
your stencil so usually like a stencil

946
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,490
that I would get for one of these boards

947
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,339
will probably be about I wanted to say

948
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:21,020
about ten dollars from a stencil so and

949
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:29,930
the stencil comes in it's a metal plate

950
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:33,140
but that big so all right well thank you

951
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:37,660
all for coming and if you have any

952
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:41,720
further questions or anything like that

953
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:45,000
you can hit me up on Twitter my github

954
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,118
is listed here somewhere

955
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,119
[Music]

956
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:56,810
well anyway hamster on Twitter hamster

957
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,680
and github and if if you have any

958
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,650
questions or whatnot

959
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,799
I try to open-source all my designs

960
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,619
they're all available on github and I'm

961
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,380
trying to create more training stuff so

962
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:11,510
that you can find tutorials you can find

963
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,850
like some templates to get yourself

964
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,850
started but anyway

965
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,040
you
