1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:11,790
all right thanks for coming is everybody

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,860
enjoying st. Conn maybe it's probably my

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,508
favorite st. calm I've only been to four

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,230
of them but they have been my favorite

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,359
so presentation time we meet gaming

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,000
today is on how to complete a vendor

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,099
review the right way and by the right

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,349
way I mean I have no idea but it's not

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,300
really true I don't think there really

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,059
is a right way to complete a vendor

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,578
security review but the stuff I'm going

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,800
to talk about today I hope is good

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,460
information to help relieve some of the

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,949
stress that we have in either

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,620
administering or receiving security

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,960
questionnaires so I'll be sharing some

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:58,680
of my experiences some of the stuff that

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:03,090
we do at at lucid software so they said

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:08,220
my name is chase Palmer I my handle is

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,840
Raider 6672 that comes from the age of

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,179
America online when they were

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,100
distributing little floppy disks and you

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,820
got about 30 minutes of free internet

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,640
and that was the username I used for the

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,158
chat rooms so then I just been too lazy

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:30,479
to change it so Raider 6672

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:33,689
my background is mainly in PCI I worked

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,509
in PCI for about ten years I spent a

29
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,130
brief stint working for the government

30
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,180
for the different Defense Information

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,100
Systems agency before I found myself at

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,009
was a software working as a security

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,630
engineer one of the big things I work on

34
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:56,790
is our our compliance and a lot of our

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,530
governance and I am a cissp and I did

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,780
one crazy thing in my life and I started

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,850
a non-profit I'm so I'm the president of

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,710
a nonprofit organization and if anybody

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,048
wants to come and talk to me afterwards

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,669
about my adventures in running a

41
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,670
non-profit you're welcome to do that

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,879
just a clarification

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,500
occasions just because I'm a CIS SP

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,899
doesn't mean I'm a hacker so if I

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,200
provide any information here that leads

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,090
you to believe that it's not true I do

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,149
not hack into things so why do we

48
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,439
perform security vendor reviews trusting

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,939
someone with our data is it can be a

50
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,730
scary thing especially when you're

51
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,828
dealing with your customers data so when

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,679
you're looking at potential vendors to

53
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,780
help you out with your work whether it's

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,909
looking at some open solar software or

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,799
off-the-shelf software and there are

56
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:53,239
certain considerations that need to be

57
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,340
taken before you plug that into your

58
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,439
infrastructure into your network or

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:04,169
before you even start giving them data I

60
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:06,030
do get the the great experience of

61
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:09,299
working on both sides of vendor reviews

62
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,819
my help administer those reviews and

63
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,340
then I also answer questionnaires that

64
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,339
come from our customers so I think I've

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,340
got a bit of a unique experience there

66
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:26,639
now having done this for a little while

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,010
now I do feel like companies are

68
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,909
performing security views in the wrong

69
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,698
way and I just want to share some of my

70
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,560
pain points and ways that I things that

71
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:42,449
I've experienced that have tried to help

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,889
simplify this a bit so why do we need a

73
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,810
perform security reviews there's two

74
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,579
main reasons why we need to perform

75
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,060
security views the first one is

76
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,819
compliance if you've spent any time in

77
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:59,340
the security field you will hear words

78
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:01,319
such as gdpr CCPA pci but then you also

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,229
have obligations that are under your

80
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,048
customers contracts to perform these

81
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,959
security reviews the other one is just

82
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,489
overall security you need to know what

83
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,299
your vendors are going to do with the

84
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,659
data that you have and you don't want to

85
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,070
be introducing any weak links into your

86
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:25,740
or major weak links into your

87
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:28,980
information security so

88
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,440
100% what does that mean well it's 100%

89
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,540
is how often it is wrong to make an

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,219
assumption about a vendor you will

91
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,370
oftentimes see vendors that will put

92
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,020
logos on their their website to say hey

93
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,470
we work with such-and-such company you

94
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,609
can trust us well I say question

95
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,970
everything you never know if they've

96
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,650
just swiped a logo off the internet or

97
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,310
they're just trying to make themselves

98
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,130
look better than they really are

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,630
so before we get started before you get

100
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,480
started in vendor reviews there's a few

101
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,150
things that you need to get an order for

102
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,750
you to be able to successfully perform

103
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:17,260
those vendor reviews or to answer them

104
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:20,080
yourself first thing is to keep and take

105
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,010
take and keep inventory of the data or

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,260
the information that you're collecting

107
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,110
from your customers your visitors your

108
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,880
website visitors your clients not only

109
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,860
do people want to know what data you're

110
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,990
collecting from them and for what

111
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,580
purpose you're collecting it but you

112
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,100
really can't protect something you don't

113
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,820
know it doesn't even exist and needs

114
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,940
protection

115
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,090
so keeping an inventory of that data is

116
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,880
really important some of the examples of

117
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,369
data that you may be collecting and some

118
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:54,520
of the general groupings of that data or

119
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:56,590
PII PCI information and employee

120
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,120
information unless you're working in the

121
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,229
healthcare industry may not have to

122
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,360
worry about health care information but

123
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:11,250
you may inadvertently find yourself in

124
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:13,540
that area so just keep that in mind so

125
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,500
this isn't an exhaustive list that

126
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,610
you're just going to have to you'll have

127
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,260
to dig deep into what find out what

128
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,750
information that you are gathering and

129
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,599
that how that information ties with any

130
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:31,660
of any laws and regulations that you may

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,000
be beholding to the next thing you need

132
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,979
to do is to classify that data not all

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,350
the data that you collect is going to be

134
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,310
super sensitive confidential information

135
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,360
but

136
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,980
a lot of it is going to be it also needs

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,320
to make sure that if you have any

138
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:54,060
contractual obligations to protect the

139
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,060
data that you are aware that and then

140
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,160
make sure you know who has access to

141
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,559
that data and whether or not they have

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,830
access to view it modify it delete it

143
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,750
etc so there's a few different ways to

144
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,240
classify your data and there's no real

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,670
right way to do it you can basically say

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,200
all data is confidential we're going to

147
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,180
treat all data as confidential or you

148
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,990
can break it out one of the most common

149
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,700
or well-known classifications is the the

150
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,700
defense are the Department of Defense's

151
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,810
unclassified secret top secret you could

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,640
do that if you wanted if you wanted to

153
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:39,580
feel cool but what you choose to do is

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,469
up to you at lucid we use public

155
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:48,460
sensitive confidential and restricted to

156
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:50,320
classify our data so there are several

157
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,450
different kinds of regulations that you

158
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,099
may run into and you need to be aware of

159
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,430
these because they can have major

160
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,830
impacts on how you run your security

161
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,930
programs and what kind of data you can

162
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,380
or cannot collect or you should be

163
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,610
collecting also certain kinds of

164
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,010
disclosures that you need to be

165
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,140
providing to your customers if you are

166
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:16,030
collecting data big ones gdpr PCI CCP a

167
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,219
and then if you're dealing with any of

168
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:24,789
the anything in the education industry

169
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:28,060
you're going to have copper Coppa and

170
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,330
FERPA so just keep those in mind there's

171
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:35,530
a lot more out there I'd also recommend

172
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:37,809
keeping a repository or a somewhere

173
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,120
where you have a list of the different

174
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,699
regulations that you have two or Glosson

175
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,270
regulations that you have to abide by

176
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,560
links to the actual text of those

177
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,870
regulations and

178
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,020
keep notes of the major provisions that

179
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,630
you need to be following because it will

180
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,920
come up in audits that you are aware of

181
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,240
those things and that's a good way to

182
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,599
prove that you are staying aware of them

183
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,000
then you need to keep in mind or

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,800
determine the risks that are involved

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,800
with keeping track or keeping that data

186
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,900
so your risk appetite risk appetite is

187
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,790
defined as the level risk that an

188
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,520
organization is prepared to accept in

189
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,910
pursuit of its objectives before action

190
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,990
is deemed necessary to reduce the risk

191
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,400
and that's going to be different for

192
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,000
each company so you're going to need to

193
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,120
figure that out

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,800
for your business for your company and

195
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,870
then just keep that in mind as you're

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,640
collecting information so as a side note

197
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,380
if you're currently if you're not

198
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,640
currently conducting regular security

199
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,680
risk assessments of your company it's

200
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,569
not something that I'm going to cover in

201
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,520
this presentation but it is a very

202
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,270
important part of your overall security

203
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,560
awareness of your security posture so if

204
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,710
you're interested I have written a blog

205
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,109
post all about security reviews welcome

206
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,760
to go check that out I'll hold that

207
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,070
there if anybody wants to take a picture

208
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,569
of it see people pulling out their

209
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,580
phones so it's a long read I'm sorry I

210
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,350
kind of got carried away with it it's

211
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,110
probably the longest blog post on our

212
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:23,630
tech blog so you might want to grab a

213
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:27,650
cup of coffee alright so who do you have

214
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:30,430
performing these reviews again this is

215
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,260
going to be different for everybody

216
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:36,109
to begin with it may be a designated

217
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,450
security person dedicated security

218
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,180
people are going to be quite familiar

219
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,670
with your business security practices

220
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,569
procedures and policies and they're

221
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,150
going to generally have a good

222
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,860
background in security and so it's a

223
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,819
pretty logical choice to have this kind

224
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,530
of person handling security views but

225
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,090
security people can tend to be fairly

226
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:01,639
expensive Lucid currently works in a

227
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,110
kind of a split capacity

228
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,939
we have where we have all

229
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,529
customer-facing questionnaires are

230
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,290
handled by a solution engineering team

231
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,490
and all vendor questionnaires are

232
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,579
administered and reviewed by the

233
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,119
security team and this has worked quite

234
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,248
well for us over the last several years

235
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:22,819
but it's something that we've talked

236
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:29,420
about re re-evaluating as we've started

237
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:31,099
to grow so as I said we do have a

238
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,199
solutions engineer team that's currently

239
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,490
working on our customer facing stuff so

240
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,709
when does it make sense to have a

241
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:41,119
pre-sales person completing the

242
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:43,248
questionnaire I don't know that's that's

243
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,290
all honesty I don't know it's going to

244
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:47,360
be different but as a general concept

245
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,079
when a business starts to grow on the

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,240
sales pipeline is flowing a dedicated

247
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:56,868
security person could possibly end up

248
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,850
being a bottleneck to the sales flow so

249
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:01,009
having a cross trained individual or

250
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,470
team that can fill these customer

251
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:05,420
questionnaires in line with the

252
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,480
salespeople can help close the deals

253
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,079
faster however since the people would be

254
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,029
sitting in with the under the sales

255
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,618
business unit and securities in their

256
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,899
primary focus these individuals may not

257
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,939
have all of the answers or may not have

258
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,819
the answers as quickly as a strained

259
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:26,059
security professional so these people

260
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:27,290
will need to have different tools to

261
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,309
help them answer the questions that they

262
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,579
might not be able to answer right away

263
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:32,809
and if that fails they really need to

264
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:34,099
have open communication with the

265
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,879
security team is going to have those

266
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,490
answers one of the downsides that I've

267
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,470
perceived from this is sometimes

268
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,410
incorrect answers are provided to the

269
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,449
customer which may end up triggering a

270
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,939
deeper investigation by the customer and

271
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:52,609
then it results in the security team

272
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,740
having to retcon the previous answer and

273
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,509
that can be a little bit embarrassing

274
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,189
sometimes and they may actually question

275
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:05,029
whether or not we have our ducks in a

276
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:08,748
row one of the tools probably one of the

277
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:10,399
best tools that I've I've seen is just

278
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,870
basically having some prefilled

279
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
questionnaires you're going to have a

280
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:21,459
bunch of prefilled

281
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:23,959
questionnaires that you can fill out and

282
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,239
drawn a blank at the moment I shouldn't

283
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,489
but well we'll cover some of these

284
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,610
questionnaires later on but having the

285
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,339
questionnaires pre filled out if they're

286
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,870
pretty standard and if you get a request

287
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,430
of complete a questionnaire it's as easy

288
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,720
as turning around and it's applying the

289
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,758
prefilled questionnaire back other tools

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,389
that can be really useful in this case

291
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,660
are also having a sock to report or any

292
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:53,990
certifications like ISO certifications

293
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,219
those can in a lot of cases eliminate

294
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,600
the need to actually complete the

295
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:03,319
questionnaire because you're providing

296
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:05,240
all the data to the customer it can be

297
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:07,040
really hard to keep track of all the

298
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,189
information I didn't realize this before

299
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,529
I started working at at loosen software

300
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:15,529
but there is a lot of information or a

301
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:18,889
lot of a lot of stuff that you have to

302
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,750
keep in mind when it comes to how your

303
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:23,509
security is working the different

304
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,949
aspects of your infrastructure and so it

305
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,509
can be really hard to keep that stuff

306
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,050
all in your head I know people that can

307
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:30,920
do it

308
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:34,040
I can't so having a knowledge base is

309
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,500
really a good tool to have to be able to

310
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,139
reference to get those answers that you

311
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,790
made to questions that you may not get

312
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,250
all too often and you may forget those

313
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,000
answers but also if you're bringing on

314
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,899
any new team members to your security

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,269
team or to your your risky risk team or

316
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,800
anything like that it can help flatten

317
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,540
out that that learning curve because

318
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,500
they have all that information right at

319
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,309
their fingertips but keeping a knowledge

320
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:07,850
base you have to keep it up to date

321
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:10,610
otherwise things will get messy

322
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,160
and if you don't upkeep it it can be

323
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,459
painful to go back and clean it up as I

324
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,709
have recently figured out firsthand

325
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:22,128
that's we may go through our data or our

326
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:24,079
knowledge base it has grown a lot bigger

327
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,769
than I had expected and it's a lot of

328
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,769
stuff to review

329
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:33,860
so right now I want to focus on the

330
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,079
there so there's two sides of vendor

331
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,480
reviews you're either on the giving end

332
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,480
or the receiving end I'm going to first

333
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,450
talk about the giving end of things and

334
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,500
we're administering those questionnaires

335
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,730
so anyone that has gone through

336
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,250
answering a security questionnaire can

337
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,910
relate to this I love answering security

338
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,680
questionnaires said know whenever there

339
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,760
are better things we could be doing than

340
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,880
spending our time answering

341
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,680
questionnaires last year at st. Conn I

342
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,110
had to step away for about eight hours

343
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,329
to help complete a three hundred plus

344
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,450
questionnaire or a 300 plus question

345
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:13,729
questionnaire and I'll get a little bit

346
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,860
more into that in a little bit but I'd

347
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,519
rather much be practicing some Red Team

348
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,930
Blue Team stuff soldering mini badges

349
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,390
and listening to all the other great

350
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,310
talks rather than sitting in a corner on

351
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,880
the phone I'm going over a bunch of

352
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,829
questions so if you're administering

353
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,660
these questionnaires just keep in mind

354
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:41,719
the poor souls that are there on the

355
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:43,219
other end of your beating stick so this

356
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,630
means that you need to be a bit more

357
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,829
selective where I would recommend being

358
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,160
a little more selective about your

359
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:52,790
questions that you're giving to your

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,790
your vendors it can be a difficult

361
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,219
process but it's going to be crucial to

362
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:01,819
getting a clear enough picture of the

363
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,290
security practices of the vendor

364
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,449
security practices so you can make an

365
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,129
educated decision on whether or not

366
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,280
they're going to properly secure your

367
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,990
information if you select too few

368
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,849
questions you're not going to know

369
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,900
anything about the vendor and you'll

370
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,540
just end up having asked more questions

371
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,480
later on and if you ask too many

372
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,470
questions then you'll get a lot of extra

373
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,550
stuff that you're gonna have to weed

374
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,250
through it's going to create a lot of

375
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:28,668
noise and again you're ultimately gonna

376
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:32,690
not get a very clear picture so there is

377
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,429
going to be a bit of a balance there so

378
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,500
knowing what data we need to protect

379
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,140
what laws and regulations you need to

380
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,430
abide by and what kinds of risks you are

381
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,930
willing to accept play

382
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:48,260
heavily into what kinds of questions you

383
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:49,970
will need to ask a good place to start

384
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,820
is to look at this standard

385
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,370
questionnaires if you don't know what

386
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,450
kinds of questions to ask they these

387
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,310
questionnaires are kind of a

388
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,270
one-size-fits-all and they're kind of a

389
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:10,250
shotgun approach they don't I lose the

390
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:15,710
screen back somebody's playing some

391
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:17,210
games these questionnaires don't take

392
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,030
into consideration as soon as we talked

393
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,760
about such as your what kind of data

394
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:26,660
you're collecting or what kind of data

395
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:31,129
they will be collecting your risk

396
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,390
appetite and such but these a lot of

397
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,250
companies like I said have these

398
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,090
questionnaires prefilled out and you can

399
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,910
get a pretty quick turnaround on them

400
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,230
those questionnaires are the standard

401
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,290
ones that I the big ones that I've seen

402
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,560
are the the CIA's top 20 the cake

403
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:53,090
the NIST 800 cig they're more commonly

404
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,730
sig light and the VSA Q we do have these

405
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,709
filled out so that we can quickly turn

406
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,120
these around if we need to they're not

407
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,920
our most favorite thing to do because

408
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,959
they are quite lengthy and as I said

409
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,630
they're kind of a shotgun approach and

410
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,210
so there's a lot of na s that we put on

411
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,830
these questionnaires and anytime we put

412
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,510
it on applicable we have to explain why

413
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:16,699
it's not applicable which is just as

414
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,870
annoying so what we do is we at loose

415
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,730
that we actually create a custom

416
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:23,209
questionnaire it's something that I

417
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,470
personally would recommend doing it

418
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,570
takes a little more time to get up and

419
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,880
running but I feel that it will provide

420
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:32,210
with the better responses and addressing

421
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,100
the specific concerns that your your

422
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:41,270
company may be facing or it may need to

423
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:44,530
look at there are platforms out there

424
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:49,100
that will do this automatically for you

425
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,690
but they'll go weed out some of the

426
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,040
questionnaires though automatically or

427
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,540
they won't present to you that as a

428
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,110
reviewer they won't present to you

429
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,970
questions

430
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:00,080
you may have deemed as low-risk but what

431
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,140
that really means is that you're just

432
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,760
asking a bunch of checkbox questions and

433
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,190
they really don't provide much valuable

434
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,679
value to you if everybody's answering

435
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,340
yes to them why ask them they're

436
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,140
probably pretty standard stuff that also

437
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:21,230
happens generally if you're asking yes

438
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:22,880
or no questions so I wouldn't recommend

439
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,410
using yes-or-no questions because you're

440
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,020
not going to get really the details that

441
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:30,860
you're going to be looking for so you

442
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,480
just need to be clear and direct don't

443
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,330
go overboard and ask for more details

444
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,700
and are necessary I just ran into this

445
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,350
this morning it seems like every time I

446
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,030
come to San Khanna I get bombarded with

447
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,889
these questionnaires that somebody must

448
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,070
think that it's a good time for me to

449
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,320
answer questionnaires but they they were

450
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,879
asking for evidence for every single

451
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,070
question that we had and some of this

452
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,440
stuff I just was shaking my head because

453
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,750
I'm not going to provide you with the

454
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:04,540
configuration files for our firewalls

455
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:07,100
and other IT equipment so stop asking so

456
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,940
don't go into my new details about

457
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,668
firewall rules you can ask what

458
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,590
software's in use but when in general

459
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,240
it's better to ask whether or not they

460
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,309
have policies in place to be able to

461
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,140
review they were the annual or review

462
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:25,280
those that software regularly we've had

463
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,570
questionnaires come in where they've

464
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,940
wanted to know every piece of software

465
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,168
and every version I just don't think

466
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,240
they're going to be going through and

467
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,590
checking out every single version of

468
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,080
every question or every piece of

469
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,580
software that we use so so again it's

470
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,409
just probably not gonna lead you to any

471
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,350
valuable data let's see so some of the

472
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:51,919
specifics that I like to look for when

473
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:54,110
performing a security review is what

474
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,000
kinds of integrations or things that I

475
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,879
should say things are that I try to take

476
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,030
into consideration is what kind of

477
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,330
integrations are we talking about common

478
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,040
ones are Salesforce we get a lot of

479
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,240
requests to for plugins to add to

480
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,470
Salesforce

481
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,330
things like Marketo Drupal WordPress and

482
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,710
those are a lot of things that may fly

483
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,840
under the radar as well it's really easy

484
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,690
to install a word plus WordPress plugin

485
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,428
but there are also a lot of really bad

486
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,990
WordPress WordPress plugins how is the

487
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:30,049
data being transferred and who has

488
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,710
access to it want to focus on those

489
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:36,500
kinds of things what kind of training

490
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,330
will they be doing everybody should be

491
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,940
doing security awareness training it's

492
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:45,918
part of PCI it's part of most contracts

493
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,570
but we want to make sure that if we're

494
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,159
gonna give somebody data that they're

495
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,590
people whoever has access to that data

496
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,639
it's going to be they know what they're

497
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:58,490
doing and they can be entrusted with

498
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:59,508
that data this is probably my biggest

499
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,509
beef with a lot of security

500
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:04,519
questionnaires I can't tell me why as I

501
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:07,279
received a questionnaire that are geared

502
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:11,179
towards platforms or in infrastructures

503
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:15,370
as a platform like AWS or Google Cloud

504
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:17,990
and sure and we're a SAS provider and

505
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,600
that 300 question questionnaire I was

506
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,820
talking about earlier about a third of

507
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,168
that questionnaire it was related to how

508
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,689
we were going to protect their virtual

509
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,830
machines and what kinds of protections

510
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,389
were in place to protect their

511
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,529
applications that they would be hosting

512
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:37,279
on there and none of that really applied

513
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:39,200
and we spent a good couple hours going

514
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,600
through those and marking those as not

515
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,590
applicable and we still had to read

516
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,959
through them to make sure we weren't

517
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:50,299
missing anything but it was just super

518
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,730
annoying yeah so loose its primary

519
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:55,580
services to drag-and-drop shapes onto a

520
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,389
canvas to visually process and correlate

521
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:02,240
data so in other words we're creating

522
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:05,360
flowcharts it does more that but we're

523
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,669
not putting virtual machines we're not

524
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,840
allowing customers to spin up virtual

525
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:13,669
machines on our on our services so it

526
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,459
should be fairly obvious when you're

527
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:20,299
evaluating a product such as lucidchart

528
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,210
on what it what capabilities it has and

529
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:26,650
so you should be able to

530
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,760
your questionnaires for that now it

531
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,880
doesn't mean you have to create a custom

532
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,950
questionnaire for each vendor that can

533
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,000
be really time-consuming and it would

534
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,820
frankly be a nightmare but we have lucid

535
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,350
as broken-up the focus and intent of our

536
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,830
questionnaire is to several different

537
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,030
categories and we'll get that or and

538
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,230
these are the categories and I'll show a

539
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:51,639
little bit of a diagram a little bit

540
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:56,860
later about how we that process diagram

541
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:00,010
how we go through that so we've come up

542
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,659
with a questionnaire as 34 questions and

543
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,990
we we may cut a few questions there

544
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,850
questions out based off the the level

545
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,850
the risk level that we've deemed the the

546
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:14,050
vendor whether or not they're collecting

547
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,040
PII or if it's other certain data so and

548
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:21,700
we may ask a few additional questions

549
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,129
vendor specific questions so we've taken

550
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,330
a look at the product and we we feel

551
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,450
that there's a few additional questions

552
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,389
that we need to ask this generally comes

553
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,060
up with using external Java libraries

554
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,240
JavaScript libraries and we want to ask

555
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:41,129
different questions about how how maybe

556
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,860
those those libraries are updated and

557
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:49,060
what kind of calls they're making and

558
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:50,590
what servers are being accessed so those

559
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,810
are just those are just some examples of

560
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,990
the questions that we're asking we try

561
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,850
to be fairly direct we don't want really

562
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,230
long-winded answers because every time

563
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,949
somebody provides a long-winded answer

564
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:05,430
we have to read that long-winded answer

565
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,240
but we don't ask yes or no questions

566
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,410
generally we don't ask you so no

567
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,820
question is if we do ask a yes-or-no

568
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:13,260
question we will ask a follow-up

569
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,260
question for a little bit more detail

570
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,300
along with administering or giving an

571
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,860
actual questionnaire it's actually

572
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:25,270
really good to actually collect some

573
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:30,610
documentation people can lie on

574
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:33,490
questionnaires they can fudge the truth

575
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,870
just a little bit but gathering some of

576
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,180
this these documents

577
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,979
performing your security reviews can

578
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,350
help provide certain levels of evidence

579
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:45,030
that those policies are in place that

580
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:50,679
they are looking at and addressing those

581
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:53,399
particular items now everybody should

582
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,480
have a privacy policy on their website

583
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,010
if you have visitors coming to your

584
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,700
website you are collecting data so you

585
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,580
should have a privacy policy sock to

586
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,190
report is really awesome to have it's

587
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,290
really painful sometimes to get but in

588
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,290
the end it's a great tool to have

589
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,879
collecting those soft reports is also a

590
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,200
great way for you to get the details

591
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,700
that you may not be able to get in a

592
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,860
questionnaire pen test results I don't

593
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,900
recommend going out and asking for full

594
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,100
pen test results because if somebody's

595
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,560
gonna give you their full pen test

596
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,570
results they're just giving you a list

597
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,129
of your their vulnerabilities and that

598
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,580
may not be a very good secure practice

599
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,480
cure you practice so generally ask for

600
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,340
summaries of the pen test numbers of

601
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,230
categories numbers of vulnerabilities in

602
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,280
different categories high low medium and

603
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:50,470
whether or not they've addressed those

604
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,690
so this is a little bit of loose its

605
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,240
decision tree that we use to determine

606
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,340
what kinds of questionnaires that we're

607
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,680
going to be providing we're not going to

608
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:04,120
provide Genesis airily the same

609
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:07,330
questionnaire to a vendor who's

610
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,489
providing a Salesforce plugin versus

611
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:16,090
somebody who's going to be a full-on SAS

612
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:20,260
provider so I don't necessarily want you

613
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,550
to internalize this is a specific thing

614
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,400
to us but just want to give you an idea

615
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,399
of the decisions that we're making as

616
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,500
we're going through this so the big

617
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,340
question is is platform an old platform

618
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,760
I kind of harp down the platform a

619
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,870
little bit earlier but platforms are not

620
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,930
bad

621
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,300
there are some pros and cons to using

622
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:45,160
platforms it makes it really easy for

623
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,270
you to follow up with vendors we find

624
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,270
that that's a real big

625
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,600
thing that eats up our time is trying to

626
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,279
constantly go through our list of

627
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,850
vendors determine when the last time was

628
00:28:54,279 --> 00:29:01,600
that we performed a review and reaching

629
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:04,059
out to them and all sorts of things you

630
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,980
can also generally get your sales team

631
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,350
involved a lot of times these platforms

632
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:14,919
will have an intake process to be able

633
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:18,158
to get vendors into the pipeline and you

634
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,999
have a lot of automation like I'd

635
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,850
mentioned earlier some of the cons I've

636
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:25,840
seen some really terrible platforms

637
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,340
where every time you clicked on

638
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,379
something the whole page had to refresh

639
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:39,309
and it took ages to answer any sort of

640
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:42,219
question so so you can it can end up in

641
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:46,600
end user frustration which then can end

642
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:50,559
in can result in longer times for the

643
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:54,519
vendor to provide responses back it can

644
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,590
be expensive and they can tend to be

645
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,619
pretty inflexible I've seen some some

646
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,360
really flexible ones out there but some

647
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:03,668
of them are pretty locked down and won't

648
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,248
allow you to to do custom questionnaires

649
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:09,100
they stick to some of those general ones

650
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:13,379
that we mentioned earlier if you are

651
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:17,469
considering a vendor platform just a

652
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:18,998
kind of a rule of thumb here a vendor

653
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,289
platform the platform's are good for

654
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:23,309
companies that are managing several

655
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:25,570
hundreds of vendors on an annual basis

656
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,779
but for companies who are just handling

657
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,939
a handful of vendors it's probably going

658
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,590
to be overkill a spreadsheet would

659
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,879
probably do well I know that there are a

660
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,080
lot of industries out there that are

661
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:41,649
pretty locked down and you may only have

662
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,689
two three four or five vendors but I've

663
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:47,889
heard of companies that have thousand

664
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:49,809
plus vendors and that would be working

665
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:55,959
off a spreadsheet would not be ideal in

666
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:58,840
that case now all of this is after I've

667
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,630
said all this you may need to be

668
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,220
prepared to do this on your own

669
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,620
sometimes vendors just refuse to

670
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,390
complete the questionnaires and so you

671
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,840
can either put a hard stop on it and

672
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,910
walk away or you can prepare to do some

673
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,449
digging and find the answers on your own

674
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:19,050
and this happens a lot with self-service

675
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,490
vendors where you're not actually

676
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,690
engaging with a salesperson you're just

677
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:27,460
going to their website and you're

678
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:30,760
signing up for a service or you're just

679
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,470
a small fry in the pool and you're not

680
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,180
providing very much revenue to that

681
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,020
vendor they don't want to spend the time

682
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,030
or the money answering your answering

683
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,990
your questionnaire because they'll end

684
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,129
up in a net loss on the deal so

685
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:50,860
switching gears we're gonna move over to

686
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,840
the the receiving end and answering

687
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,429
these questionnaires

688
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,720
if you're handling data from your

689
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,070
customers there's a good chance that

690
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,680
you're gonna be asked to fill out these

691
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,429
questionnaires and it may seem pretty

692
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,500
straightforward but they can get a

693
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:09,060
little complicated so I do have some

694
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,060
tips to help answering these questions

695
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:16,480
number one is focus on the scope of the

696
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:18,399
service as I discussed earlier you can

697
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,990
get questionnaires that go way beyond

698
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,710
the scope of what you're going to be

699
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,060
providing to the customer and in the end

700
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:28,740
the customer is really going to be

701
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:31,659
concerned about a number of things

702
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,820
they're gonna be concerned about how do

703
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,900
they get their data to you in a secure

704
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:41,580
way when you have their data what are

705
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,780
you gonna do to store it and protect it

706
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,460
who's going to have access to that data

707
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,790
and where are they going to be accessing

708
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,820
that data and do the people who have

709
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:55,840
access to that data know what they're

710
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,730
doing and how to protect it and if

711
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,899
something goes horribly wrong who can

712
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:04,710
they contact so try to avoid providing

713
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,710
responses to

714
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:15,820
provide try to keep you keep it in scope

715
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:18,070
don't try not to provide responses that

716
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,200
move into areas where you're not going

717
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:25,360
to be accessing data so for example lose

718
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,970
a chart we lose the charts completely

719
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,850
hosted within AWS in a virtual private

720
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,369
cloud it's completely segmented from our

721
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:37,178
corporate network so for the most part

722
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:39,249
we consider our corporate network out of

723
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:42,039
scope now there are a few things that we

724
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:45,340
have to still consider because we do

725
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:48,669
have some remote access into into that

726
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:51,220
environment but when we respond we

727
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:57,759
primarily focus on our AWS

728
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:58,990
infrastructure it can be really tempting

729
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,149
when you're getting you these

730
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,149
questionnaires to try and really

731
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:07,178
reinvent the wheel so it's a lot easier

732
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:09,339
to refer to a customer referral customer

733
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,069
to a section within an information

734
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,540
security policy which can usually

735
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:15,639
provide the exact information as

736
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:19,359
customers looking for without you having

737
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:22,000
to rewrite it now don't be a jerk and

738
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:26,949
say look in our information security

739
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,569
policy but rather say something I refer

740
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,689
to section 4 of our business continuity

741
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:33,129
policy and this will it save you time

742
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,609
from having to write out long response

743
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:39,250
long explanations that are already well

744
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:42,279
documented and the customer is going to

745
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:49,480
get actually better evidence that the

746
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:53,040
particular items being addressed now

747
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,599
this is a really easy trap to fall into

748
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,290
it can be tempting to provide too much

749
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,970
data and too much details when and you

750
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,829
may end up providing sensitive

751
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:06,419
information that you probably shouldn't

752
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:09,250
be providing to anybody for example

753
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,880
avoid providing exact names to people

754
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,680
who are in charge of certain things

755
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,630
don't provide configuration details

756
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,629
about networks routers or firewalls

757
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:26,760
so ask yourself can this information be

758
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:29,790
used by an attacker to gain access to my

759
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,920
network does it provide information that

760
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,450
somebody could use for a phishing or a

761
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,220
phishing attack if yes don't provide it

762
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:42,930
security professionals should understand

763
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,520
that loose' will provide executive

764
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,200
summaries of our scan results and pen

765
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,230
test results but we don't provide

766
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,669
customers with the details about them

767
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,040
we'll give them the number of

768
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,060
vulnerabilities found the criticality of

769
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,970
those findings and whether or not

770
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:01,589
they've been fixed you wouldn't want to

771
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:03,118
provide a customer or you wouldn't want

772
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,819
to provide an at a potential attacker

773
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,619
that that you have an SQL injection

774
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,790
vulnerability that was found on the page

775
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,670
and that you're still working on fixing

776
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,349
it if that information got into the

777
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,410
wrong hands you'd be having a very bad

778
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:15,410
day

779
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:24,960
be clear in your responses but remember

780
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:27,210
this isn't a marketing campaign putting

781
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,339
too much fluff on your responses can

782
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,770
actually backfire it makes it sound like

783
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:33,560
you're trying to cover things up so keep

784
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,509
it simple and straight to the point and

785
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,160
so none of this best of market

786
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,670
state-of-the-art we're better than our

787
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,129
competitors stuff it'll just create

788
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:47,430
doubt so let the salespeople do the

789
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:52,079
selling so here's a couple examples of

790
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:55,710
and these are I've made these up but

791
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,150
they I have seen examples of these and

792
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:01,140
they're based off of examples that I've

793
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,790
seen so on the left you have the company

794
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,500
has implemented a state of the art

795
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,540
interactive security and compliance

796
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,710
program to ensure the necessary levels

797
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,520
of understanding and knowledge of bla

798
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,670
bla bla bla bla bla

799
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,990
I just shut off we're a good response

800
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,300
would be all employees go through a

801
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,328
security awareness training upon hire

802
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,680
and annually thereafter and software

803
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:21,990
developers go through regular secure

804
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,368
coding training other security related

805
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,290
trainings are made available to

806
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:27,300
employees on an ad-hoc basis through our

807
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,210
learning management system it's a much

808
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,920
clearer direct response they're getting

809
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,260
the data that they need they're not have

810
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:41,880
to weed through a bunch of marketing

811
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:42,769
fluff if you're collecting data about

812
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,329
your customers

813
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:47,279
you're gonna need probably legally

814
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,170
required to have a privacy policy

815
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:52,680
published on your website as I mentioned

816
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,809
earlier but having good information in

817
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,490
your privacy policy about how you're

818
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,730
protecting the data you collect and

819
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:02,669
having a security white paper - that's

820
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:05,099
publicly available can help reduce the

821
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:10,829
amount of questionnaires that you may be

822
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:13,109
asked to complete it's it's also a very

823
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:15,200
common practice to limit who can request

824
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:17,819
that a questionnaire be filled out

825
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,038
you'll often see this limited to

826
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:22,740
enterprise customers those who have

827
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,930
custom contracts or those who generate a

828
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,868
minimum amount of revenue on an annual

829
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,368
basis so that can also reduce the number

830
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,010
of questionnaires that you may be asked

831
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:34,289
to complete but you need to be careful

832
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,960
with the approach if you set your

833
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:39,920
thresholds too high then your sales

834
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
teams may be struggling to close deals

835
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,549
but providing this documentation online

836
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,368
for the smaller customers can help them

837
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:49,369
get the answers that they may need so

838
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:58,529
and I'd be lying if our legal team

839
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,440
didn't tell me to put this in here but

840
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:03,779
it's important to have non-disclosures

841
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
you are gonna be providing certain

842
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:10,289
levels of sensitivity data with certain

843
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,599
levels of sensitivity to these customers

844
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,920
and so you want to make sure that you're

845
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,529
protected legally so make sure that

846
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,450
before you provide sauk to report spent

847
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:21,359
test results executive summaries of

848
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,038
those pen test results or any other

849
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,078
details about your information security

850
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,440
policies make sure you have a

851
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,740
non-disclosure in place this will

852
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,970
protect you legally if a customer

853
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,578
misuses any of the information that you

854
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,828
provide to them such as providing it to

855
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,950
a customer or to a competitor I should

856
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,950
say

857
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:49,910
so now that you've got all these vendors

858
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:52,220
and you've completed reviews on them you

859
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,870
need to keep track of them and that

860
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,850
comes down to vendor management what are

861
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,109
you gonna do to or how you what are the

862
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:01,400
different things that you need to do to

863
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:04,400
keep track of these vendors number one

864
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,380
is when to evaluate highly regulated

865
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,990
industries like financial our

866
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,340
educational institutions may have this

867
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,779
dictated for them I've never worked in

868
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,970
directly with these in these industries

869
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,460
so I don't know exactly what those

870
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:24,100
regulations are but I know that they are

871
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:27,020
highly regulated so this may not apply

872
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,970
but as a rule of thumb at minimum if

873
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,590
your customer interacts with the product

874
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:34,640
either directly or indirectly the

875
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:36,230
application or the service or sorry if

876
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,600
the application of the service will have

877
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,490
access to your network or your you are

878
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,970
sharing data with the vendor you will

879
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:47,270
want to contact the security review your

880
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,879
risk appetite legal obligations they may

881
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,650
have a say in this as well you may

882
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,500
choose to conduct full reviews on all

883
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:58,030
vendors every time or you may be a

884
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,320
little more selective about about who's

885
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:03,340
you may be more selective based on the

886
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,900
sensitivity of the data and your good

887
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,090
gonna provide partial reviews to lower

888
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,640
risk lower sensitive lower sensitive

889
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,720
vendors and leave the full full reviews

890
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,339
to the rest so you'll just need to

891
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:23,390
figure out what what works best for your

892
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:27,290
organization re-evaluating in most cases

893
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:29,060
it's it in a lot of cases it's not

894
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:33,020
necessary to review them every single

895
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,759
year but there are some vendors that you

896
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:39,230
will probably need to review on it on an

897
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:42,380
annual basis things that we that we've

898
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,510
done as far as revaluing re-evaluating

899
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,760
vendors will provide conditional

900
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,620
approvals on some vendors and those

901
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,650
approvals will last three to six months

902
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:54,759
and at that time we'll need to conduct a

903
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:57,500
another review

904
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,730
this will generally occur if we find

905
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,460
that something is missing in their

906
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,620
security but they're a low-risk vendor

907
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,610
and they've indicated that they're that

908
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:09,080
fixing it is on their immediate roadmap

909
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,480
annual reviews are conducted on

910
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,680
mission-critical services and high-risk

911
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,290
vendors so they have a lot of access to

912
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,210
a lot of sensitive data moderate-risk

913
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,870
vendors are evaluated every other year

914
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:26,660
and low-risk vendors are conducted on on

915
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:29,810
an ad-hoc basis there are of course

916
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,339
exceptions to these rules such as if we

917
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,840
discover that a vendor has made the

918
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,820
significant change to their product

919
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,770
they've been bought out or merged with

920
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,200
another company or been suspected of a

921
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,910
data breach in which case we will

922
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,980
perform a security review sooner than

923
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:47,509
what they may have been in originally

924
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:49,880
scheduled for keeping a record of your

925
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:53,600
approvals is really important for audits

926
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,980
and also for historical purposes to make

927
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:01,640
sure that somebody doesn't start using

928
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,680
an application and say that you did

929
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:09,319
approve it and you can't you can't prove

930
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:13,819
that you did or not so keep track of

931
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:16,220
them so what she what should keep track

932
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,530
of you'll want to keep track of who

933
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,169
performed the assessment who gave the

934
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,000
approval the date of the approval and

935
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,500
any notes of any risk or any special

936
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,330
conditions with that approval you may

937
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,600
have other laws and regulations again

938
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:37,610
that are going to have a factor here how

939
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:41,029
how long you store them might be three

940
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,140
years might be seven years but if you

941
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,970
don't have anybody telling you how long

942
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,259
you have to keep them you don't want at

943
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,879
least keep them round for at least at

944
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,970
least until a new review has been

945
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:55,220
conducted so you have a continual you

946
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:58,430
always have a fresh review on hand and

947
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:02,089
then keeping track of where your data is

948
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,680
and what purpose it's there for it's

949
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,390
called data mapping and anybody who's

950
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,669
involved in gdpr and also data mapping

951
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,469
is

952
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:11,269
it makes it a thousand times easier when

953
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:13,309
it comes to knowing where your data is

954
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:15,319
if you are on top of your data mapping

955
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:18,079
and keeping track of any time you bring

956
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,779
on a new vendor keeping a log of what

957
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,459
data they have access to and where that

958
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:23,900
data is going to be stored whether

959
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,328
that's in the United States or it's

960
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,359
gonna be in another country so just do

961
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,359
it

962
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,920
it's a vendor reviews can be hard but in

963
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:39,078
the end it's worth it you'll be a lot

964
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,939
safer and you'll have a lot more

965
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,430
confidence in the products or the

966
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,689
vendors that you're going to be using

967
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,149
it's also going to help your customers

968
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:49,699
and it's going to boost their confidence

969
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:52,839
in you so it's definitely worth it in

970
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:56,449
the end and with that brings me the end

971
00:44:52,839 --> 00:45:04,869
there any questions out there about what

972
00:44:56,449 --> 00:45:04,869
we've discussed no questions yes

973
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,970
I'm so I couldn't quite hear the

974
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:29,810
question I heard something about the the

975
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,810
standard questionnaires and Howie

976
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,970
that's that's a good question so the

977
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,880
question is is you know how did we

978
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,410
decide what questions to pull from the

979
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,570
standard questionnaires is that what

980
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:55,180
you're asking oh yeah yeah so it really

981
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,900
came down to the lot of the areas of

982
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:01,210
focus that we're looking at we're really

983
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:06,610
concerned about where that data is is

984
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:08,350
living because of GDP our reasons we

985
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,340
want to know what kind of data they have

986
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:14,380
access to and so questions about their

987
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:19,570
their storage methods their access

988
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:22,180
control and things like that we're gonna

989
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:25,090
be pulling in a lot of the questions

990
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,169
we've actually written with free-handed

991
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,610
written them we didn't actually pull

992
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,470
them from the question is but we've

993
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,670
we've used them for as inspiration I

994
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,919
don't know if that was a very good

995
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,350
answer to your question but it's it's a

996
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,730
complicated thing

997
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,730
are they any other questions

998
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:52,140
we'll generally just say that it's

999
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,750
against our security policy to provide

1000
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,779
that information we generally don't get

1001
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:00,000
much pushback when it comes to that

1002
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:03,119
but we've had pretty good success with

1003
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,329
then we we just don't provide that

1004
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,329
information right here

1005
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:34,330
uh-huh yeah so the question is is is how

1006
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:38,049
do we how do we balance when a when a

1007
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,640
question or we find out that a vendor

1008
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:43,150
isn't up to snuff

1009
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:46,060
but we've the the people requesting the

1010
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,490
vet the the software deems it as a

1011
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,620
critical part of the business flow that

1012
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,750
happens it happens a lot and you get a

1013
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:57,370
lot of conflicts between the the risk

1014
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:59,410
team or the security team loose weed we

1015
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:04,029
we've at least set ourselves as will

1016
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:08,259
provide the evidence and our advice on

1017
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:11,890
it and but we're not necessarily the the

1018
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,780
last stop of authority for it if there

1019
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,060
is a disagreement we will run it up the

1020
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,250
chain to our executive management where

1021
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,340
it will be reviewed and that's when we

1022
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,630
apply are kind of our risk appetite we

1023
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,370
determine what kinds of risk are

1024
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,750
involved and whether or not that's

1025
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:32,770
something that we're willing to take on

1026
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:36,040
with this vendor anything else great

1027
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,580
questions all right if there's no other

1028
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,900
questions thank you for attending I hope

1029
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,069
you found something interesting out of

1030
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,470
it

1031
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,770
and feel free to come and talk to me

1032
