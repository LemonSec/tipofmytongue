1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
still brave enough to be here at st.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,930
count on a Friday at 11 o'clock you're

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:10,639
about to see something amazing I would

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:15,360
love gives me great honor and pleasure

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,590
to introduce one of the most talented

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,980
security people I've ever had the

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,410
opportunity to meet and collaborate with

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,910
and it just so happens that he's also my

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,710
brother-in-law which makes it really

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,830
cool because we get to collaborate more

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,789
often on family things and stuff ladies

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:39,480
and gentlemen put your hands together

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:40,950
for Seth Johnson okay hopefully I can

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,629
stand here a little bit close and it's

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,000
not going to mess up the mic yeah thank

16
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,890
you all right so today I want to talk

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,019
about social engineering and how I got

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,850
in a social engineered into giving this

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,600
talk here at st. Conn and a number of

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,370
others to start out with though I want

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,629
to get rid of some disclaimers I'm going

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,830
to talk about some things in this talk

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,679
that have some conditions the first one

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,600
is there's no warranty for this I can't

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,439
guarantee that it will do anything that

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,210
you want

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,619
I can't even guarantee that it will do

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,639
anything that I want although I would

29
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,439
certainly like to and I there are no

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,650
claims that you can make against me in

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,880
relation to this presentation

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,460

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,299
you guys over there the a/v disk so I

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,720
know everyone has some questions that

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,050
we've got to get through to begin with

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,890
and we're mostly not going to do that I

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,650
just want to and

52
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,589
or the burning question in everyone's

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,290
minds which is when does a social

54
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,060
engineering start in this talk and the

55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:30,450
answer is right now while we're talking

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,020
about right now I'd like to share an

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,600
inspirational quote the wheel turns and

58
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:42,780
turns and turns it never stops and it

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:45,260
stands still who's feeling inspired

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,260
right now

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,090
confused great okay

62
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,840
no subtle hints or anything or included

63
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,340
in this talk all right

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,940
how many of you have been to a talk that

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,070
I've given before a couple of you okay

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:08,430
how many of you are ready for story time

67
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,070
great so we're gonna we're gonna get

68
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,360
down to story time in many of my talks

69
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,190
one of the things that I like to do is

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,420
tell stories about real life things that

71
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,260
I've done or things that have happened

72
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,030
to me in social engineering usually I'm

73
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,470
the target because it's fun to have

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,820
someone who's a social engineer be the

75
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:30,120
target and it's also fun as a social

76
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,700
engineer to target others and elicit

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,600
some interesting behavior the first

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:44,328
story that I want to tell is of course

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:46,230
about Jupiter and sank on in general so

80
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,160
you shouldn't have provided me that

81
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,768
picture so we started planning st. Cohn

82
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,150
in pretty much November of last year and

83
00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:00,269
we've been working on it for a long time

84
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,890
and all the committee members have put

85
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:07,500
in a lot of work for this however thank

86
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:12,660
you yes for all the committee members

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,280
thank you very much there there also

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,940
comes a time when the committee members

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,728
are asked to do more and sometimes it

90
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,260
comes from very direct sources like Troy

91
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,930
coming to me and saying hey Seth will

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,889
you speak it's an con but this year

93
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:33,300
I got it through a new vector I got an

94
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:37,410
email from someone on the leadership

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,669
track saying South Troy said that you

96
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,160
would be a great addition to our

97
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:48,570
leadership track this year we'd love to

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:53,160
have you speak and so I received the

99
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:56,610
email I read it and I thought dang it

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,289
I'm gonna try and be a team player but I

101
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,610
wanted to avoid giving a number of talks

102
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,190
this year I wanted to focus on some

103
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,310
other things so I sent back a nice

104
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,830
message both to Troy and to the

105
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,229
leadership track people suggesting a

106
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,530
couple of different ideas and that they

107
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:17,099
should pick one of those ideas for me to

108
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:23,549
give a talk on who recognize the fatal

109
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:25,350
flaw in that story all right so the next

110
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,199
story that I want to talk about is

111
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,720
escalators escalators are fun escalators

112
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,430
are here escalators are fun while

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,900
they're here and there are lots of

114
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,820
people who are here with us a lot of

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,250
social engineering can be done very

116
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,110
simply with a minimum amount of tools so

117
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,789
last night I made some plans and

118
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,050
modified my talk to include the

119
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,500
escalators because I thought that would

120
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,690
be fun and this morning I woke up early

121
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,490
got upstairs to our printer and printed

122
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:04,130
out a sign I placed it in one of the

123
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,349
official devices here on the campus and

124
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:12,330
place it immediately in front of the

125
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:13,949
escalator I'm disappointed that we only

126
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,180
have a black and white printer because I

127
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,080
think color would have been far more

128
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,370
effective but we we placed this thing

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,919
right in front of the escalators you can

130
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,979
see with the picture and then sat back

131
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:32,549
and watched and counted the next story I

132
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,469
want to talk about is last year giving a

133
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,229
social engineering talk I think on this

134
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,430
stage we talked about social engineering

135
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:42,270
and threat modeling

136
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,639
how many of you were here for that two

137
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,630
people okay

138
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,500
well then this is gonna be a little bit

139
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,180
less fun for you we discussed how threat

140
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,830
modeling works and if you're a security

141
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,660
professional you might already know this

142
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,570
if you're not I'm gonna just briefly

143
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,900
explain threat modeling is assessing all

144
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,979
the different threats that you have and

145
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,419
the ways in which they might interact

146
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,750
with you or prevent you from achieving

147
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:09,990
your objectives and there's an entire

148
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:14,340
apparatus to do so figuring out what you

149
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,289
can do to deal with those threats and we

150
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,830
discussed that at length last year in

151
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:21,960
st. Conn about how to do that during the

152
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,690
question and answer period someone

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,789
decided to ask me

154
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,560
so with this threat modeling thing do

155
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,580
you just do that around Thanksgiving

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,900
dinner with your family and I didn't

157
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,719
have an answer for that yet but it

158
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,060
sounded interesting and I had never done

159
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,210
threat modeling at Thanksgiving dinner

160
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,700
before for those of you who know me and

161
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,969
have been around me my response to that

162
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,430
of course is that's a great idea we

163
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,979
should try that I think it's incredibly

164
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,930
important for us to figure out how to do

165
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,919
threat modeling in family dinner

166
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,270
situations I might be the first person

167
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,299
who's ever tried this but it was

168
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,070
fascinating so I liked the idea and I

169
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,639
decided to accept this challenge with

170
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:14,010
great Vemma and vigor it also worked out

171
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,590
very fortuitously because st. Conn last

172
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,250
year was right before Thanksgiving as it

173
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,270
is this year

174
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,120
and so I decided that I wanted to go to

175
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,830
Thanksgiving dinner and do some threat

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,229
modeling assessments on my family

177
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,710
members and from a social engineering

178
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:34,559
perspective the next thing that I want

179
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,829
to talk about is a visit that I had to a

180
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,319
restaurant and this restaurant will

181
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:44,970
remain nameless but I had a situation in

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:51,980
which I was social engineered by a menu

183
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,980
oh thanks man hold on one moment

184
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:02,079
delicious all right I will

185
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:06,639
I was social engineered by a menu at a

186
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:09,399
restaurant it turns out that on the menu

187
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,769
for the drinks there were two particular

188
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,779
items that cause a great deal of what is

189
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:18,399
usually known as cognitive dissonance

190
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:20,589
for me personally you can see these two

191
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,689
menu items seated right next to each

192
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,709
other on the screen the one on the right

193
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:31,689
is lemonade the one on the left is Lima

194
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:34,179
Nauta that's right one named in English

195
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:35,649
in one name in Italian because of course

196
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:40,329
the restaurant which will not be named

197
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:42,669
is an Italian restaurant for those of us

198
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,858
who have spent some time learning some

199
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:49,480
other languages that's a problem I don't

200
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:53,410
know which thing to order so I decided

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,399
to discuss this with my group and with

202
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:01,868
the server to try and resolve this

203
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:07,360
concern the last part of story time that

204
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:10,029
I want to share is a visit to a clothing

205
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,139
retail establishment where they have

206
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,040
these rooms I don't know what they're

207
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,949
called does anyone know what these are

208
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,480
called changing rooms dressing rooms

209
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:23,229
fitting rooms they're called one of

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,879
those things and the one that I went to

211
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:30,040
is actually different than the picture

212
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:35,410
here yeah I did not go to a place like

213
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,689
this because clearly yeah so the place

214
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,618
that I did go to had full-length doors

215
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:43,929
all the way down and if you've ever been

216
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:47,709
to one of these places you know that

217
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:50,079
it's always hit or miss about whether or

218
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:51,669
not you can actually get into one of

219
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,569
these rooms and it becomes even more

220
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:58,179
complex the moment those doors shut how

221
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:59,679
many of you been in that situation the

222
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:02,709
doors are shut and you don't know if

223
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,870
anybody's in there it's difficult right

224
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:09,119
and it's hard to be

225
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,839
light and also get stuff done because

226
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,520
nobody wants to stay there forever

227
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:18,670
waiting for those doors to open so I

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,370
took care of my family member who was

229
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,260
trying some things on and then I sat

230
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,870
there and waited because I was not

231
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,910
trying anything on and another woman

232
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,450
came up and looked down the hall of

233
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,630
these very close two doors and said it

234
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:38,170
looks like everything is closed I said

235
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,580
well maybe there have been some of those

236
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,819
doors that have been closed for a long

237
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,440
time and then I suggest that there's

238
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,650
probably a way that we could figure out

239
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,390
which doors have people behind them and

240
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,920
which doors do not so now that we've

241
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,020
talked about story time let's talk about

242
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,939
some of the motivations that work with

243
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,339
social engineering everyone wants to

244
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,370
know why does social engineering work

245
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:09,700
and I'm going to answer that in one word

246
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,860
reasons reasons of the way that social

247
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,890
engineering works because people are

248
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:20,010
motivated by reasoning and sometimes

249
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:22,660
that reasoning is inhibited by emotion

250
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,520
one of the emotions that prevents us

251
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,800
from making great reasoning judgments is

252
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,810
Authority how many of you have been

253
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,469
influenced in a social setting by

254
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,949
Authority how many of you are being

255
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,570
influenced by an authority right now

256
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,310
thank you I appreciate it

257
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,630
how many of you kept your hands down

258
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:51,369
because I said that two of you all right

259
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:53,050
great authority helps us to do things

260
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,690
makes us do things that we didn't

261
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,240
necessarily want to do or plan on doing

262
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,209
Authority can be a good thing sometimes

263
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,540
it makes us go to our jobs and treat our

264
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:07,089
bosses nicely and authority can be a bad

265
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,770
thing as well but Authority is a

266
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:15,820
motivator that drives people to specific

267
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:18,310
behaviors I have seen Authority use in a

268
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,410
number of ways both for good and

269
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,000
for bad and I'm going to probably be

270
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,829
using it a number of times and the rest

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,840
of this talk but I also like to point

272
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,690
out that in some of these stories

273
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,520
Authority was actually used for example

274
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,610
in speaking at st. con someone

275
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,410
referenced an authority and that was

276
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:40,390
enough to get the hook in authority is

277
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:45,370
also used in a lot of situations such as

278
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:48,730
in phishing emails it's very easy with a

279
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,380
phishing email to suggest that someone

280
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,380
in authority wants you to transfer that

281
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,320
money even if that person does not want

282
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,180
you to transfer that money and that's a

283
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,470
high-value target for a lot of the

284
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,469
phishing emails that are going out today

285
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,960
Authority is often a powerful motivator

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,200
and can be combined with other things as

287
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,630
well one of the other motivators I would

288
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,810
like to talk about is avoidance how many

289
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,160
of you have avoided something you have

290
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,469
experience with this you know what it

291
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,770
looks like how many of you have avoided

292
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,320
someone at this conference don't want to

293
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:29,939
talk to that person thank you Matt for

294
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,940
raising your hand I appreciate it

295
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:39,250
when things are uncomfortable or

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:42,100
disagreeable we often go to perhaps

297
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:46,480
great efforts and great lengths to avoid

298
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,990
getting into those situations when we do

299
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,450
that we have a particular set of

300
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,820
behavior that can be reproduced social

301
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,310
engineers can use this to their

302
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,520
advantage if you are a social engineer

303
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,890
you can present a scenario to someone

304
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,230
which they would like to avoid and they

305
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,000
will likely not choose that path if you

306
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,589
are being social engineer doesn't

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,990
someone is exhibiting this sort of

308
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,060
behavior on you it is helpful to pull

309
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:18,250
your head up out of the sand and take a

310
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:23,380
look around another motivating factor

311
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:29,380
for most people is a desire to be good

312
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:31,420
and help others very often this desire

313
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,120
is used in social engineering settings

314
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,279
to do

315
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,020
things such as asking someone to hold a

316
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,850
door open for you while you're carrying

317
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:42,740
a very large box which may or may not

318
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:44,060
have anything in it sliding in behind

319
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,970
someone or holding the door open for

320
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,949
someone else all of those things are

321
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,260
couched in this nature that would be

322
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,520
have to help one another in a in a

323
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,110
social setting when we do that we are

324
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,689
providing social value and we feel

325
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,640
better about ourselves and lift the

326
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,790
community I'm giving a talk today

327
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,029
because I want to help you it worked on

328
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,029
me

329
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,529
fear is a very powerful motivator it's

330
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,850
one of my least favorite motivators I

331
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,700
don't like it very much I don't even

332
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,310
like scary movies I don't like to use

333
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,279
this with other people but it can be

334
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:25,489
used very often this is used in a number

335
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:28,720
of phone call sorts of scenarios or

336
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,339
email sorts of scenarios with extortion

337
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,710
how many of you have received an X or

338
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,610
ting email based on a fear motivator in

339
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,950
the past six months a lot of you I've

340
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,770
turned on your webcam I've seen you or

341
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:48,410
if you don't do if you don't give me a

342
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:51,439
bunch of iTunes gift cards then the IRS

343
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,630
will be coming after you those are very

344
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,940
interesting fear-based motivators that

345
00:16:53,630 --> 00:17:00,380
have great effect on a lot of people

346
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:05,059
fear can go all the way to sending to

347
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:07,880
threats that is even more powerful

348
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:12,879
depending on Maslow's hierarchy of needs

349
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,880
and how desperate that person can be

350
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:28,769
it's great lemonade this sort of

351
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:33,799
fear-based motivator is incredibly

352
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:36,480
malicious and I would advocate that as

353
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,429
social engineers we should avoid using

354
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,950
this if someone is using this against

355
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:44,639
you you should push back and possibly

356
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,529
even notify the authorities on the flip

357
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:48,629
side of that one of the other things

358
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,389
that is a great motivator for people is

359
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:54,090
this idea of hope hope can be a

360
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:57,149
motivator for a number of things one of

361
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,230
those things is the optimism bias how

362
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,908
many of you believe that you're not

363
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,330
going to get in a car accident on your

364
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:04,919
way home today everybody raise your

365
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,370
hands you don't think that's gonna

366
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,279
happen

367
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:13,559
I really hope that it doesn't for all of

368
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:17,429
you and I plan on driving home in my car

369
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:21,360
today because of that hope because of

370
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,710
that optimism bias when we have

371
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,570
something to hope for or something to

372
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,220
look forward to we often perform

373
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,460
additional actions to be able to get

374
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,460
there

375
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:33,750
another thing that you may have noticed

376
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:36,469
in this talk or perhaps in the

377
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,929
conference center around today our

378
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,529
visual cues and signs these visual cues

379
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:46,019
and signs take advantage of

380
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,990
pre-established conditions and ideas

381
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,539
that you already have in your head with

382
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,769
inside the human brain there are a

383
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:57,480
number of pathways that are established

384
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,990
that are faster because they've been

385
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,519
used multiple times you do these kinds

386
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,990
of things all the time without thinking

387
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,259
about it most of you did not have to

388
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:11,340
think to walk up the stairs or to sit in

389
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:14,309
your chair you don't have to think to

390
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,870
lean back in your chair and you probably

391
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,639
don't even think about it if the chair

392
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,029
squeaks that you stop leaning back in

393
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:24,928
your chair all those things are cues

394
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,789
that happen naturally and when you

395
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:30,029
compare that when you pair that up with

396
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:31,650
a situation in which there are social

397
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,890
norms involved

398
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,540
that can also be a powerful motivator

399
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:40,380
how many of you have seen a social cue

400
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:44,850
or sign today that influenced your

401
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,850
behavior anyone want to shout out an

402
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:52,469
example for us

403
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:53,490
what's that ballroom a you wanted to go

404
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,190
to a talk there okay

405
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,570
you saw the sign you walked in great

406
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,020
news you've been social engineered to

407
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,919
walk into ballroom a saint's con did it

408
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,920
nice work

409
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:13,229
there's also an idea of inertia inside

410
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,790
of social settings things that you have

411
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,220
done in the past you're more likely to

412
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,070
do again and things that you are already

413
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,410
doing you're more likely to continue for

414
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,570
example if you came to the first three

415
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:28,050
days of st. Caan you're likely to be

416
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,970
here on day four there are a number of

417
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,270
people who aren't here on day four but

418
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,800
the majority of people are this sort of

419
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,690
thing is very useful in social

420
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,060
engineering by creating a scenario that

421
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,570
either looks like or is a similar path

422
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:48,030
that gets someone to do something to an

423
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:51,899
attackers advantage praise and flattery

424
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,760
is also an effective tool that helps

425
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,350
social engineers to get what they want

426
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,720
it feels great to be praised

427
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,909
it feels great to have Troy come up here

428
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,300
and say that he's enjoyed working with

429
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:10,380
me that may or may not be a motivator as

430
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,889
to why I'm giving this talk but it feels

431
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,840
great

432
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,540
to have someone say nice things about

433
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,050
you when someone says nice things about

434
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,840
you

435
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,909
you feel like they have your best

436
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,689
interests at heart that may not

437
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,370
necessarily be the case many

438
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:33,150
manipulative social engineers use this

439
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:35,250
tactic to great effect next liking and

440
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,520
this has a couple of different contexts

441
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:42,000
one is you are far more likely to do

442
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,840
something because someone you like has

443
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,850
endorsed it or suggested it

444
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,949
some of you may be here today at this

445
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,780
talk because someone told you that this

446
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,200
would be a good talk and you might be

447
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,360
feeling a little disappointed right now

448
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,860
some of you are here today because you

449
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,290
know me and you like me and you think

450
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,919
this is a great talk let's raise our

451
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,230
hands for those people one person okay

452
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,620
so we're doing great here really

453
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:12,070
appreciate that vote of confidence

454
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,030
does it help if I say that I like you

455
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,379
how many more hands can I get with that

456
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:25,399
I got a thumbs up three four ten zero

457
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:27,980
nothing generally this entire idea is

458
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,310
encased in the the notion of building

459
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,050
rapport when you have rapport with

460
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,639
someone you're more likely to engage

461
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,940
with them and you're more likely to do

462
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,110
what they ask you're more likely to

463
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:44,630
enjoy interacting with them and this can

464
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,399
be very helpful it can be very

465
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,280
detrimental this rapport is also used

466
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,200
for celebrity kinds of endorsements how

467
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,450
many of you have seen a celebrity

468
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,940
endorsement for a political candidate or

469
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,660
for a product that is entirely unrelated

470
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,670
to their experience okay you've seen

471
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,400
that all the time

472
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:06,890
you have very prominent people in the

473
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,150
cinematic industry endorsing political

474
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,630
candidates you should vote for this

475
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:16,370
person because as a person who makes

476
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:22,250
movies I would know people who play

477
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:23,840
sports endorsing restaurants where they

478
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,210
probably don't even eat because of their

479
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,149
training regimen those kinds of things

480
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,750
end up being rapport building situations

481
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm far more likely to buy food at

482
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,880
McDonald's if LeBron James eats and

483
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,780
McDonald's simply because I like LeBron

484
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:46,480
James and all of those things are used

485
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:49,490
in a situation to create behaviors or

486
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,630
disclose information from people in

487
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,170
social engineering settings then there's

488
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,520
also the social proof or social

489
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,929
inhibitors

490
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,629
for those of you who are staying at

491
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,340
hotels today or have been during this

492
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,860
week how many of you saw the little

493
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,709
placard in the bathroom do you know what

494
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,059
I'm talking about the one that says hey

495
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,910
we're trying to save the planet if you

496
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,520
want to keep your towels hang them up if

497
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:25,040
you want them changed throw them on the

498
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:28,700
floor they've gone to interesting

499
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,190
lengths to improve the effectiveness of

500
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,610
those messages in fact recent research

501
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:38,660
suggests that if they put on their some

502
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,729
numeric values and relate it to the room

503
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:45,080
that you are in you are far more likely

504
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:47,210
to not have them replace your towels so

505
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,730
instead of saying hey we're trying to

506
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,010
save the planet you should not be a jerk

507
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:56,270
and you should hang up your towels if

508
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:59,690
they say 56 percent of the people in

509
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:03,620
this room have hung their towels back up

510
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:06,380
and have saved the planet you are far

511
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,510
more likely to do the same because you

512
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,669
can see that situation and you relate to

513
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,010
those people who were in that room

514
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,870
before you even though you know nothing

515
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:22,520
about them that's incredibly powerful

516
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:24,168
social proof on the flipside when you

517
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,910
see those signs some of you might be

518
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:30,080
thinking I know what you're doing here

519
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:34,100
you're not interested in saving the

520
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,220
planet one bit you are trying to save

521
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,490
money and put more money back into your

522
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,490
pockets as a hotel I don't know the

523
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:47,030
answer to that motivation but either one

524
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,419
of those things is an impetus for them

525
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:55,570
to put up that placard and perhaps both

526
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:57,290
of those things will result in the

527
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,270
situation that is desired

528
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,520
meaning the hotel will likely save more

529
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,650
money and you will likely do something

530
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,059
to save the planet by not putting your

531
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,960
towels on the floor which I would

532
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,639
encourage you to do

533
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,970
perhaps not because of the sign but

534
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,040
because I said so recycling

535
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:19,320
how many of you have seen the recycling

536
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:24,920
sign on this can Wow okay two of you how

537
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,919
many of you are blind great three of you

538
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:32,970
recycling is a very powerful social

539
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,710
impetus we all are interested in the

540
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:38,700
future of the planet to one degree or

541
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:42,690
another and recycling bins are often

542
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,170
clearly marked such as this one but

543
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,820
these recycling bins can also be misused

544
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,540
how many of you have thrown something in

545
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,520
a recycle bin that doesn't belong there

546
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,670
okay a couple of you any reasons why you

547
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,680
did that

548
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,720
what's that it was close by who laziness

549
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,980
I didn't add that to my talk okay we're

550
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,990
gonna pretend like there's a slide here

551
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,230
for laziness that's a great motivator

552
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:09,120
not doing stuff that will definitely

553
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,620
motivate you how many of you want to do

554
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,260
laziness later on this afternoon after

555
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,689
the conference great how many of you are

556
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,690
doing it right now

557
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,690
sweet

558
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:29,580
the notion from a social setting that

559
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,090
recycling is better for the planet

560
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,879
is so pervasive even people who can't

561
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,490
read those words but can see the symbol

562
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:44,610
are impelled to follow those

563
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:46,140
instructions the next one and this is

564
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,830
one of the most powerful ones for me

565
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,900
personally is commitment when you commit

566
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:55,110
to do something you are far more likely

567
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,120
to do that than when you don't my

568
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,530
children are the best at getting this to

569
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,169
happen

570
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,970
this goes ranges from everything - from

571
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,430
bedtime stories to attending Saint Cohn

572
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:09,720
dad you promised that you would read to

573
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,020
me - bedtime stories okay fine I'll do

574
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,150
it

575
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,160
you promised you would bring me to st.

576
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:19,140
Con this year he's here how many of you

577
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,010
have been motivated by your commitments

578
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,290
a couple of you any interesting

579
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:32,160
situations you've been impelled to

580
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:35,610
to follow through on you bought a ticket

581
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,130
to st. Conn yeah and you told me you

582
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:43,229
would so you kept your promise so glad

583
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:45,720
that you did I'm here up in front of you

584
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,980
speaking today because I said I would

585
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,960
and because someone put it on the

586
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,950
schedule so I'm trying to keep my word

587
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:57,090
to the next one that I want to talk

588
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,770
about is concessions although this one

589
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,480
references the concession stand where

590
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,910
you're likely to pay far more for items

591
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,140
than you should the concession that I'm

592
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:09,990
talking about is I'm getting you to give

593
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,260
me something and when I do that I'm far

594
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,930
more likely to get more after the fact

595
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,430
for example when someone sends me an

596
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,490
email saying hey Seth we'd like you to

597
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,740
speak at st. Conn and I send them back

598
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,640
here are a few ideas please choose one

599
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:31,850
their email coming back to me says those

600
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:37,620
sound great I agreed to do one talk and

601
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,570
found myself to be doing more we often

602
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,120
put ourselves into these situations and

603
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:46,379
we don't want to have that socially

604
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,689
awkward feeling where you've given

605
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,940
someone something and they ask for more

606
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,250
and you don't really want to but you

607
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,070
feel like you need to you feel like you

608
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,610
have to give just one more hour of st.

609
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:02,040
Conn to listen to this talk go on or you

610
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,840
feel like you have to wait until the end

611
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,580
of the awards that hackers challenge

612
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,470
because you have that hope that you

613
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,790
might have one spoiler alert

614
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:13,590
you probably didn't although all of

615
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:17,399
those things are concessions that you

616
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:19,949
make when I asked Matt for a lemonade he

617
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,570
says yes I'll give that to you and then

618
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,640
I tell him I need you to come to my talk

619
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,510
because I need people in my talk and

620
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:31,290
then I need you to come up on stage and

621
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:33,060
get my lemonade to me right

622
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:37,680
did Matt bring me a lemonade in this

623
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,958
talk yes he did why I just asked him for

624
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,009
a lemonade

625
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:43,009
speaking of lemonade this is delicious

626
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:56,729
uh-huh can you hold this for me for just

627
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:59,759
a minute hold my lemonade yeah hold it

628
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:02,429
you have to hold it just hold it mm-hmm

629
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,889
that there may or may not be some

630
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:10,759
incentives involved but we're getting

631
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:16,258
degreed later so hold on all right so

632
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:18,419
the the next one is scarcity or the fear

633
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,509
of missing out how many of you have

634
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:25,619
purchased an item on an electronic

635
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:27,269
retailer such as Amazon okay how many of

636
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,809
you have seen that little text at the

637
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:35,129
bottom there's only X number of this

638
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:40,529
left on the planet thing right sold out

639
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:42,658
almost or you're booking a hotel 75

640
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:46,619
people have booked this hotel in the

641
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:48,419
past three minutes there are only 20

642
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,809
rooms in the hotel guys like how does

643
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,879
that work

644
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,069
well we meant like in the entire world

645
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:55,529
and we meant for the rest of all time

646
00:31:53,069 --> 00:32:00,229
like the more you can make that scarcity

647
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:04,190
appear the deeper that influence goes

648
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:07,129
this influence worked very well for a

649
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:11,209
large marketing and filmmaking

650
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:15,149
organization generally characterized by

651
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:17,069
an animated Mouse where they put

652
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:19,498
cinematic productions into what was

653
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:24,529
called the vault how many of you

654
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:24,529
remember that how many of you hated that

655
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:29,189
that's artificial scarcity it was

656
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:31,679
created for the purpose of motivating

657
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:37,609
you to go out and buy that film

658
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:40,349
immediately all of these things

659
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:41,999
incentivize you from the perspective of

660
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:44,239
you don't want to miss out you don't

661
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:48,539
want to be the one who doesn't have

662
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:52,079
whatever movie that was the special

663
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:52,650
edition the Platinum Edition the one

664
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,210
with the direct

665
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,210
just cut that I'm sure you've never seen

666
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,880
this is also an incredibly powerful

667
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,140
motivator in situations where people are

668
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:10,040
far less well-off than you in

669
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:14,370
third-world countries where they have

670
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,200
much fewer resources than we do scarcity

671
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,959
is a really powerful motivator if

672
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,640
there's not enough food people will do

673
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:27,180
incredible things to try and get that in

674
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:31,290
the end scarcity as a generic motivator

675
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:35,610
is based as a subset I believe of the

676
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:39,030
concept of fear the next one of course

677
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:44,909
is greed hey what happened you got to

678
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:49,340
hold it hold my lemonade the greed is a

679
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:52,860
powerful motivator and is often used in

680
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:58,949
scams online and in-person as you can

681
00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:02,070
see today we all want things and we

682
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,240
often want things for free sometimes we

683
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,889
want things for a little amount of

684
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,760
effort this is why the Nigerian prince

685
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,320
is so awesome in the world today I don't

686
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,200
know how much money that person has been

687
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,080
able to make but incentivizing people by

688
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:20,279
saying if you give me this tiny thing I

689
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,819
will give you all of this stuff all of

690
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,640
this stuff ends up being the greed and

691
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,010
it's a very powerful motivator a number

692
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,060
of you have come to st. Con today

693
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:37,020
because of a badge that you get to take

694
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:40,199
home in the past we've done some

695
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:45,060
interesting experiments with greed at

696
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:46,230
st. Conn a number of years ago for one

697
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,520
of the things that we gave out of sink

698
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,090
home we gave out of Raspberry Pi do you

699
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,130
remember this

700
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:56,040
and we we sent out an email to the

701
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:59,040
participants of st. Conn and suggested

702
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,230
to them that they needed to pay a

703
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,509
remaining X number of dollars and sent

704
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,270
some random amount to be able to pick up

705
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,450
their Raspberry Pi

706
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,850
and that X number dollar since was very

707
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,759
small and the value of the raspberry pi

708
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:16,549
is very big so people were incentivized

709
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,400
to react to that we had people coming to

710
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,410
the registration desk all day asking who

711
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,430
they paid and how they need to pay that

712
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:27,410
so they could get their raspberry pie if

713
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:29,930
you think that you as a security person

714
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:35,560
or as a hacker are immune to this you

715
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:37,700
are very wrong and as proof of that I

716
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,410
would like to return you to your

717
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:43,189
schedule next week when you go back to

718
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:45,649
work you want money in your pocket so

719
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,380
somehow you're motivated to go back to

720
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,440
that job honestly though I hope your

721
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:54,260
jobs better than that

722
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,150
next is reciprocation if I do something

723
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,330
for you you're far more likely to do

724
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,800
something for me I promised Matt that if

725
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,330
he brought me some lemonade he would get

726
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,290
a show you still hold that lemonade

727
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:10,819
sweet yes and he brought me the lemonade

728
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:13,220
this is a reciprocal relationship this

729
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,109
works both in professional relationships

730
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,220
social engineering relationships and

731
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:19,730
even romantic relationships

732
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:22,250
give-and-take is there when all of those

733
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,500
things come together we create a

734
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:28,880
scenario in which social engineering is

735
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:32,180
a very very powerful force social

736
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,700
engineering can be used to turn all

737
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,368
kinds of things into very different

738
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,640
scenarios and reciprocation helps to

739
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:45,160
grease those wheels to say you're

740
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,600
getting something out of this too and

741
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:53,040
then as my next slide I'd like to

742
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,330
present to you blank all right so

743
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,410
let's get back to story time how and if

744
00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:04,470
you want a complete story time great so

745
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:07,109
back to the retail establishment selling

746
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,669
clothing the doors are closed you can't

747
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,800
see it under them to see if there are

748
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,200
feet there and I'm sitting here with

749
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,660
this woman who I do not know who wants

750
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,480
to know whether or not someone is in

751
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,460
those rooms I suggest to her that there

752
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,070
has not been anyone coming in or out for

753
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,440
several minutes so the likelihood is

754
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,140
very high that there's no one in there

755
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,170
and then the next thing that I said was

756
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,770
would you like me to knock on those

757
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:38,970
doors and find out I'll do it if you

758
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:43,580
were afraid to do that to which she

759
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:47,100
responded don't worry I'll do it even

760
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:50,610
the suggestion of fear is an interesting

761
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,680
motivator she was not afraid of me but

762
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,420
she might have been afraid of looking

763
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,370
like she was not able to do that for

764
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:01,080
herself even though I was perfectly

765
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:02,190
willing to do that either way next let's

766
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,690
talk about the lemonade actually I'd

767
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,690
like my lemonade back that's delicious

768
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:19,830
thank you very much I'll have something

769
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,630
for you later maybe it's gonna be an

770
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:29,340
empty can of lemonade oh let me drink it

771
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:30,870
really quick so in this particular case

772
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,220
is this Luminato

773
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,339
I don't know I know it says lemonade

774
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:40,350
okay in this particular case I ordered

775
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:43,110
neither of these menu items and then at

776
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:46,290
the conclusion of this event in this

777
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:49,620
restaurant I went there I was with

778
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:52,380
family I left and I was just disowned I

779
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:59,529
don't know what happened but it was no

780
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:04,420
longer a family situation going back to

781
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:07,150
Thanksgiving dinner so because someone

782
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,280
suggested it at Saint Con and I was up

783
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,860
for the challenge I decided to perform

784
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,620
some social engineering threat modeling

785
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,850
at Thanksgiving dinner and I'm probably

786
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,420
gonna do it again this year because it

787
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,420
was super fun

788
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,290
well I can't reveal the characteristics

789
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,610
of everyone in my entire family or name

790
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,080
their names because that's probably way

791
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,300
inappropriate with this particular group

792
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,009
I'd like to share with you the Thomas

793
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,810
Killman instrument for conflict

794
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,490
resolution and I'd like to tell you

795
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,210
about the different people in my family

796
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:40,149
using animals there are a number of

797
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:43,780
people in my family who do not like

798
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:46,390
conflict they hate it in fact whenever

799
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,640
conflict shows up they'd like a turtle

800
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:51,370
pull their heads back in or go to

801
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,650
another room I have some people in my

802
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,029
family who are very accommodating like

803
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,590
the teddy bear and they'll just cuddle

804
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,390
up to you they're so excited to be there

805
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:02,230
and probably are dying on the inside I

806
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,839
have the people who love that

807
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,910
reciprocity giving things and taking

808
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,980
things they're the Fox that's always

809
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,720
trying to compromise and get something

810
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,900
going on get something for themselves

811
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,029
and maybe give you just a little bit do

812
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,560
you have the wise people who are clearly

813
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,630
ready to collaborate with you on

814
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,600
anything from opening up the oven to

815
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,280
slicing the turkey but my personal

816
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,490
favorite are the Sharks

817
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,200
they love to compete they love to be

818
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,299
right they love to be right about

819
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,649
everything and they love to tell you and

820
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,990
I love to poke it with a stick I love to

821
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,800
say no you're wrong

822
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:43,839
no you're wrong being able to turn all

823
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,050
of these things into a game made

824
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,540
Thanksgiving so much more fun I don't

825
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,640
know if I would recommend it although I

826
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:57,070
kind of recommend it you should probably

827
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:00,339
try it that's this year so it's gonna

828
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:03,480
happen try we're we're gonna we're gonna

829
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,480
do threat modeling it'll happen

830
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,820
I don't know which one you are sure

831
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,470
we're gonna find out you're probably not

832
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:16,030
a shark

833
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:20,649
I probably don't have to poke you with a

834
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:25,270
stick then alright so anyway that was a

835
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:28,000
super exciting event for me but clearly

836
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,859
the Sharks are the most entertaining it

837
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,150
is also very interesting to try and use

838
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,200
some of the compromising people and

839
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,260
figure out what things they're willing

840
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,328
to compromise if you can change that

841
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,270
dynamic and that reciprocity to be a

842
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:43,030
little bit in your favor that's fun

843
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,069
let's talk about the escalator so this

844
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,550
morning I printed out signs put them

845
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:51,369
down in front of the escalators and

846
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:56,609
incentivized people to not use the

847
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:56,609
escalators and that escalated quickly

848
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,900
87% of the people who saw that sign took

849
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:03,490
the stairs

850
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,260
I had my son sitting there tallying

851
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:11,500
everything 87% in fact there was only

852
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:14,230
one person who took the escalator by

853
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,030
themselves when there were no other

854
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,680
people on the escalator and we actually

855
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,200
went to go ask them why and they said

856
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,029
well I just needed to get there the only

857
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,770
other people who use the escalator going

858
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,630
up were people who saw someone else

859
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,310
already on the escalator which tells you

860
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,140
the power of social proof is greater

861
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,299
than the power of my printed crap sign

862
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:36,190
that was posted right in front of the

863
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:38,740
escalator I decided however to up the

864
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,530
ante and I don't know if you can read

865
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:45,939
that but it says do not exit I put it at

866
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:49,150
the bottom of the escalator and Troy

867
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:52,660
this is payback for making me speak at

868
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:56,550
st. Con this is Troy trying to go back

869
00:42:52,660 --> 00:43:03,250
up the escalator after seeing that sign

870
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:05,589
it happened yeah fabulous news as far as

871
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,410
being invited to speak at Saint Con Here

872
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:11,880
I am telling these crazy stories in

873
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:16,420
front of you clearly it worked on me as

874
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,780
social engineering always does so what's

875
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,410
next for you what's next for me I'd like

876
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,030
to suggest something for you try it out

877
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,740
it's totally free you don't

878
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,720
to pay me anything you could be greedy

879
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,399
about it you can reciprocate and I'll

880
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,779
give you like create crazy tips about

881
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,640
how to have fun of Thanksgiving dinner

882
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,680
all of those things are great

883
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,350
but I would encourage you to try out

884
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,509
social engineering learn how it works

885
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:42,880
when you do you will probably also learn

886
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:45,490
some interesting things such as how the

887
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,770
human brain works you will learn that

888
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,500
very often you perform social

889
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,660
engineering tasks on yourself every day

890
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,790
you will start to learn that you're

891
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,710
telling yourself that story you are

892
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,270
showing yourself those visual cues you

893
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,580
are noticing the things that keep you

894
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:03,370
sane and you'll be grateful that you

895
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:06,100
will be questioning all the time why

896
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:07,359
does this work and what should I be

897
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,610
scared of what do I need to do

898
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,170
differently when you do that I believe

899
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,730
that you will be far more protected

900
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,500
against social engineering attacks for

901
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,230
yourself personally and you will be

902
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:22,150
capable of helping others to prevent

903
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:24,690
social engineering attacks on them thank

904
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,690
you very much

905
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:36,660
[Applause]

906
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:40,549
any questions that's really not that

907
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:43,819
good I think I prefer Lima not that Oh

908
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,820
it's for him

909
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:58,380
greed powerful motivator all right no

910
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:01,370
questions great go enjoy the closing

911
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,370
