1
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:19,380
alright guys it's time thanks for coming

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,820
out lots of you here so today I wanted

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,960
to talk a bit about the dark web and

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,420
hopefully in a way that you haven't

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:34,890
thought about it before but first I want

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:42,780
to talk about moving let's do this a

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:47,160
different way there we go okay forget

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,440
the notes we don't need those alright so

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,449
I want to talk about kind of the idea

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,300
behind this and why I even wanted to

11
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,489
talk about the dark web to begin with

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,819
and I want to tell you a story little

13
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,108
story probably a story that many of you

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,290
in this room can tell because your

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,710
security professionals and the story

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,960
starts something like this right so I'm

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,580
at home and I'm mowing my yard and I'm

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,229
talking to my neighbor who knows I work

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,360
in security or you're in your office and

20
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,658
you know somebody drops by because they

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,640
know that you work in security or just

22
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,460
friends or family you know my mom likes

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,670
to send me random texts and like you

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,149
know ask you questions about security

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,950
and the way this story goes and the way

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,780
this question goes is that person

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,840
whoever it is in your life right shows

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,680
up and they look at you and they kind of

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,149
look away and they look back and they

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,369
look away and they shuffle their feet a

31
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,210
little bit and you know they want to ask

32
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,439
you something

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:56,548
right usually it's like is email secure

34
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,899
no okay whatever or can you fix my

35
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:04,460
computer definitely no but the question

36
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,630
as they look at you and then look away

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,119
it's like spit it out already

38
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,590
right and so they look at you and they

39
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
kind of get up close and they whisper a

40
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,980
little bit

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,659
have you been on the dark web has

42
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,000
anybody had that question had that

43
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,060
conversation right if you've been on

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,620
security for a little while probably

45
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,140
because people don't know what to think

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,959
of the dark web they're like what is

47
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,659
this thing can I even say it out loud is

48
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:39,849
the dark web like Voldemort we don't say

49
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:41,530
that word all right and so that was why

50
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,470
I wanted to have this conversation

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,299
because I think there's a lot of

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:51,940
misconceptions about the dark web and

53
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:53,829
exactly what it is before I dig into all

54
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,069
of this so I do want to have a little

55
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:59,859
disclaimer okay I'm gonna talk about

56
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,869
things that have happened okay

57
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:05,409
they actually did there's things that

58
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,879
happen so this isn't political I don't

59
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,798
really care why they happened or who did

60
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,030
them or you know who was involved it's

61
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,180
just things that happened that

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,660
illustrate a point this is not a

63
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,030
conspiracy theory okay again things

64
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,590
happen we can look at facts and make

65
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,049
determination about how we want to

66
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,959
approach those facts but some of the

67
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,940
thinking behind why we should be

68
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,010
embracing the dark web some people would

69
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,150
think or say is conspiracy theories or

70
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,069
something else that's not what this is

71
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,250
about this is also not a call to Anarchy

72
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,569
okay

73
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,669
I am not condoning illegal activities

74
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm not asking you to go participate in

75
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:49,079
something that's gonna get you in

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,079
trouble in fact exactly the opposite

77
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,340
so before we dig into this too far there

78
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,609
I want a level set on a couple of things

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,019
okay a lot of people in here maybe I

80
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,599
don't know maybe go on the dark web

81
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:06,909
every day maybe you host your personal

82
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,649
bio on the dark web that's weird but you

83
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,929
know I don't know what everybody's

84
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,000
experience is here so I just for the

85
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,650
purposes of this conversation

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,599
I'd like to level set about what I'm

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,699
talking about

88
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,988
so on this graphic that I stole from the

89
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,639
internet

90
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,549
it shows the internet as a whole okay

91
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,379
and what they're saying is

92
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,030
at the World Wide Web the thing most of

93
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,960
us think of as the Internet is the tip

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,150
of the iceberg

95
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,969
okay that's everything that's indexed or

96
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,919
publicly accessible and then somewhere

97
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,020
in the middle is the Deep Web which is

98
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,060
stuff that's not necessarily publicly

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,758
accessible but network connected to the

100
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,159
Internet and again the purpose here is

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,690
not to debate semantics because if

102
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:49,879
anybody's really into this stuff we

103
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,949
could probably go off in the lobby out

104
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,960
there later and we could argue for a

105
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:57,110
really long time about what constitutes

106
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,020
the definition of the world wide web or

107
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,199
clear web or Internet what the Deep Web

108
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,909
is what the percentages are doesn't

109
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,250
matter for the point so that I want to

110
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:10,370
talk about today and the final piece is

111
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,050
the dark web okay and again from the

112
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,419
graphic that I stole from the N or that

113
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,840
even that says this is the place where

114
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,299
all the illegal activity happens so and

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,060
basically what we're saying is that the

116
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,830
dark web is just a layer that is a part

117
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:31,099
of the rest of the Internet and I just

118
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,560
want to like disband any of the whispers

119
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,909
right now right the dark web is just

120
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,400
technology okay you can say it out loud

121
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:42,050
it's okay you can talk about it you can

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,549
tell your friends about it just because

123
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,080
you went on the dark web doesn't mean

124
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,509
you bought drugs or sold guns or tried

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,609
to hire a hitman okay but the important

126
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:55,940
thing is that it's technology that was

127
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,370
designed in a specific way and that's

128
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,639
what I want to talk about today so the

129
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,840
technology itself that powers the dark

130
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:08,300
web is designed to be private okay it's

131
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,628
designed to be anonymous it's designed

132
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,159
to be secure and depending on how you

133
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:18,800
approach the dark web it's also designed

134
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:21,289
to be decentralized so why do we care

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,690
about those things right because what

136
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,770
I've seen as I've been in technology now

137
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,099
for over 20 years

138
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,710
is that as new technology comes along

139
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,659
somewhere along the way we start

140
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,880
thinking that we have to solve problems

141
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,849
or come up with ways to deal with things

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,080
like privacy that supposedly we've never

143
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,300
thought of before

144
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,599
it's like this is a new paradigm we've

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,910
got a new do new stuff right but I want

146
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,300
to dig into a little bit those aspects

147
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,360
of the dark web privacy security and

148
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,440
decentralization and talk about where we

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,530
come from in that space so we'll start

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,530
with privacy who here cares about

151
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,659
privacy okay a couple of hands it's

152
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,429
becoming more popular okay

153
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,039
used to be people were like you're

154
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,229
giving me free email I don't care okay

155
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,110
I get a coupon to the barbecue place I

156
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,758
don't care right there's been a little

157
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,050
bit of a shift back the other direction

158
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,110
in the last couple of years because

159
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,759
people are starting to realize as

160
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,430
there's a breach announced three times a

161
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,930
week that maybe all my data in the world

162
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,830
shouldn't be on the internet that's not

163
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,930
where it belongs what we hear lots of

164
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,380
times when we talk about privacy is this

165
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,680
idea of I have nothing to hide who has

166
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,539
nothing to hide in here I got one hand

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,750
up but I think he was actually waving it

168
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:48,370
somebody to hands okay so somebody in

169
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,370
here thinks you have something to hide I

170
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:54,400
think a more important question is who

171
00:07:51,650 --> 00:08:00,669
here has an identity

172
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,989
very few people this is disturbing okay

173
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,880
who here feels like they have an

174
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,880
identity that there's something about

175
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,800
you that's unique right okay a lot of

176
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,029
people now are sort of raising their

177
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,650
hands I think they're embarrassed about

178
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:17,800
their identity

179
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,370
okay and I did okay there you go very

180
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,449
good you have lots of items I'd like

181
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,970
okay so most people cultivate uniqueness

182
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,430
they cultivate an identity okay whether

183
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,490
it's online or in real life whatever it

184
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,140
is most people you know choose the shoes

185
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,849
the clothes they wear because they want

186
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,309
to look a certain way you get a certain

187
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,440
haircut you have certain friends you

188
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,359
participate in certain things whatever

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,209
it is you're building up an individual

190
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,370
picture of yourself okay and everybody

191
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:56,020
has that so I want to look back at what

192
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,940
identity has meant historically okay who

193
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,399
knows what happened and this is going to

194
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,980
be a stretch right because I'm about to

195
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,080
talk about history

196
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,730
okay and when I talk about this today

197
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,470
history means 10 minutes ago on

198
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:14,770
Instagram I'm but things have happened

199
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,899
before today things that have influenced

200
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,750
the way that we've built our societies

201
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,209
and that stuff is important as we look

202
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,390
forward into technology and start

203
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,739
thinking about how do we take those

204
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,720
principles and the things that we

205
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,180
learned and apply them today don't act

206
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,270
like we just made them up right I've got

207
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,709
kids that are in those teen years and my

208
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,319
favorite thing is when they walk up and

209
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,390
they're like or I tell them it's like

210
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,149
you know hashtags actually an octave

211
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:46,390
thorpe right there was a name for it

212
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,600
before Twitter yeah okay or a pound sign

213
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,189
I'm fine with that right but but what

214
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,870
we're seeing now in technology is it

215
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,430
moves really really rapidly people keep

216
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,899
feeling this need it's like oh I have to

217
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,479
come up with a new name for something

218
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:02,770
know it existed already ok privacy isn't

219
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,500
new so as we go back into history who

220
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:12,640
can tell me what happened in December of

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:15,070
1941 Pearl Harbor okay so Pearl Harbor

222
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,680
for the United States was the beginning

223
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,110
of World War 2 it had been going on

224
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,290
before that okay but we've been staying

225
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,810
out of it we were like I don't think the

226
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,790
Pearl Harbor happened

227
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:31,979
and everything changed in the United

228
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:34,170
States and so because of that the

229
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,020
President of the United States signed an

230
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:41,449
executive order that made certain parts

231
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:45,510
of our country strategic military zones

232
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:50,790
now as a result of that in February of

233
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:54,300
1942 there were hundreds of thousands of

234
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,180
people that were involved in their

235
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,939
communities ran businesses were born in

236
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,969
this country were active going to school

237
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,260
had homes lived all over the this

238
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:10,350
country okay for generations who had

239
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,780
nothing about them that was wrong except

240
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,840
for an identity okay they had the

241
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:20,310
audacity to have parents or relatives

242
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:23,730
that were born in Japan you really

243
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:27,150
should keep that under control all right

244
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,130
so they had this identity that resulted

245
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,160
in soldiers showing up at their door

246
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,480
with guns in the United States okay in

247
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,089
California on the East Coast and taking

248
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,860
all of these japanese-americans they

249
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,980
were Americans they were born here most

250
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,000
of them and putting them on two trains

251
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,980
and taking them out to internment camps

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,560
where they were stuck in shacks they

253
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,030
were surrounded by barbed wire and they

254
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,579
were guarded by soldiers with guns and

255
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,790
that was a difference between a Tuesday

256
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:06,000
and a Wednesday on Tuesday they were

257
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:10,800
business owners and neighborhood members

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,870
and you know students on Wednesday they

259
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,880
were prisoners of war here's the

260
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:24,350
interesting thing about this event that

261
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:26,550
happened 59 years later in the year 2000

262
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,300
even though the US Census Bureau had

263
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,099
denied it for a very long time it was

264
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,300
revealed that they use census data to

265
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,020
identify these people and then seven

266
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,400
years after that it was a reveal

267
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,640
even though it had been denied and it

268
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,860
was expressly against the statement the

269
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,210
top of the census form that said we will

270
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,730
not disclose this information they used

271
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,790
detailed micro census data to the block

272
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,000
level and house level to identify and

273
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,160
locate japanese-americans they were

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,700
incredibly successful at rounding them

275
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,030
all up because they violated their

276
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,560
privacy and their civil rights and use

277
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,959
something that had been turned over in

278
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,000
good faith as something that should be

279
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,400
used to help her in our country in a

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,720
more effective manner to put them in

281
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:25,069
prison this activity is part of the

282
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,050
foundations of the right to privacy

283
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,730
there's lots of other examples that

284
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,880
happen in this time period of world war

285
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,420
two but it was so impactful that we

286
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,030
learned something odd when that happens

287
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,430
but we learned something and when the

288
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,260
war was over the United Nations

289
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,680
Universal Declaration of Human Rights

290
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:50,330
was drafted okay part of that as you'll

291
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,819
see here is article 12 okay and says you

292
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,490
shouldn't be subjected to arbitrary

293
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:58,670
interference with privacy it's a human

294
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:07,250
right and we talked about it today like

295
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:13,490
it's an option okay I want to talk about

296
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:15,380
decentralization next now we're gonna

297
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,330
move back in history according to the

298
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,730
Instagram ten minute timeline but not

299
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:28,720
nearly as far okay 2013 who knows who

300
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:36,620
this guy is I got some hands who we got

301
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:42,110
yeah Edward Snowden who's ever heard of

302
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,440
this company couple of people so lavabit

303
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,530
was the secure encrypted email service

304
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:54,350
that Edward Snowden used to transfer

305
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:58,459
information now up until this dude

306
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,350
showed up the guy running lavabit was

307
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,340
running a successful technology company

308
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,520
and then Edward Snowden came along and

309
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,350
he got a letter that said you need to

310
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,660
turn over your SSL keys and your

311
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:16,760
encryption keys for everybody because

312
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,850
Edward Snowden Snowden used the service

313
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,140
now if you're running a secure service

314
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,210
that the whole point behind it is that

315
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,100
it's secure and is private what do you

316
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,120
think the fastest way is to kill your

317
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,190
business maybe give over all the

318
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,760
information inside of your service right

319
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,220
so he was faced with a choice his choice

320
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,780
was do I violate everything about my

321
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,540
company and turn this information over

322
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:47,900
or do I go to jail because there's no

323
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,160
other option and not only that when this

324
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,840
happened you get what's called a

325
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,569
National Security Letter anybody know

326
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,910
what that is go read about it they're

327
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,350
cool they're from the FBI

328
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,360
okay National Security Letters when you

329
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,880
get them they come essentially with a

330
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,170
gag order okay so you get it you can't

331
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,550
even talk about it you can't tell

332
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,530
somebody you got it you can't tell what

333
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:12,170
it's about and so the CEO of the company

334
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,790
was in this position where he really

335
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,209
didn't have many choices and what he

336
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,760
chose to do instead of give the

337
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:24,040
information over ago to jail was shut

338
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,450
down the company okay now this is

339
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,550
unfortunate because something he'd been

340
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,560
working at for a long time you know lots

341
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,699
of us work for companies and find them

342
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,170
to be pretty important they pay my bills

343
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,150
lots of us have started companies and

344
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,860
know what it's like to put that kind of

345
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:45,050
effort into something and care about it

346
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,790
and in one day this guy lost his company

347
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,740
just because of somebody that happened

348
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,579
to use his service he had no control

349
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,970
over and the challenge here is that when

350
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,620
we work in a centralized model there's

351
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,040
always somebody at the middle of that

352
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,260
that has control so if you have an ax

353
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,940
company that's important to you

354
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,099
you're operating inside of a centralized

355
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,460
model you find out that you have very

356
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,389
few choices okay you can either comply

357
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,880
or you can destroy your company you know

358
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,560
we see this in lots of other places too

359
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,770
who's ever downloaded an app on their

360
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:27,099
phone couple of you all right

361
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,540
when you did that you had permissions

362
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,360
right and now you can agree to the

363
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,920
permissions or not but where's the point

364
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,870
where you get to agree to some of the

365
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,940
permissions and still use the software

366
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,189
it's either don't and don't use the

367
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,500
software or agree to everything that you

368
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,630
want to do yeah I want to play this game

369
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,520
right now it needs access to my phone it

370
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,650
needs access to all my contacts it needs

371
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,550
access to take pictures of me you need

372
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:58,810
why I don't know right but you have no

373
00:17:52,550 --> 00:18:01,730
choice there right and we see this

374
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,280
expanding so there was this journalist

375
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,140
who decided that she was going to go

376
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,030
through an experiment and cut the big

377
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,510
five tech companies out of her life

378
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,399
okay Facebook Amazon some people say

379
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,600
Netflix I don't know why but whatever I

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,720
guess they invent some technology

381
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Facebook Amazon Apple Google and

382
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,030
Microsoft and what she did was she went

383
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,379
one week at a time and and she had a VPN

384
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,350
set up that blocked all the IP addresses

385
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,540
and you can see the headline in here

386
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,860
I cut the five tech giants from my life

387
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:36,830
it was hell okay because what she found

388
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,020
out was that if you want to turn off

389
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,720
Amazon

390
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,910
good luck right because just about

391
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,590
everything you use you want to use a

392
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,830
lift or an uber yes really they run on

393
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,169
AWS okay you want to use Google Maps

394
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,850
guess what runs on Google cloud now

395
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,460
sometimes AWS depends on what you're

396
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,110
dealing with but the point is is that

397
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,280
almost everything that you use on a

398
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,860
daily basis from a technology

399
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,030
perspective goes back through one of

400
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,189
these five companies and so that affects

401
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:11,360
your freedom and your ability to make

402
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:15,640
choice and if you choose not to it's

403
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,639
turned off no recourse

404
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,630
let's talk for a minute about security I

405
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:26,100
was gonna get there eventually it is a

406
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,750
security conference what happens when

407
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,320
you choose to browse the web securely

408
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:35,720
has anybody ever done that all right we

409
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,520
got one you don't use the internet right

410
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,020
yeah sure

411
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,049
so browsing the web securely there's a

412
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,840
few components that go into this so you

413
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,490
can turn off ads because you know who

414
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,559
wants that stuff in your face and

415
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,690
they're always putting cookies on your

416
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,250
machine then they invite other cookies

417
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,529
onto your machine and it's like this

418
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,380
whole thing plus I just don't like them

419
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:03,570
because I think it's weird that when I

420
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,190
look at something on my phone it shows

421
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,070
up on my wife's computer later

422
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:13,140
right and vice versa I don't care that

423
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:15,029
much about shoes all right so but if you

424
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,130
start blocking ads then you start seeing

425
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,470
this stuff it's like we noticed you're

426
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,539
using an ad blocker our site depends on

427
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,390
this to survive please turn this off and

428
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,250
we're not gonna let you look at stuff

429
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:30,059
okay so that's a pretty minor thing

430
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,789
though right it's like ads whatever well

431
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,110
then you start blocking some cookies

432
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:35,640
okay and if you start blocking cookies

433
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,959
you actually start breaking things for

434
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,000
real

435
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,370
the IRS really doesn't like it when you

436
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,710
block cookies I don't like it when you

437
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,209
block anything it's weird

438
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,580
Amazon stops working you can't log into

439
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,429
Gmail there's a few other things that if

440
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,350
you turn off cookies your web really

441
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,029
stops functioning and if it does

442
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,360
function at all it looks like something

443
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:59,399
I really expect the gifts with the music

444
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,428
when you load the page it's looks really

445
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:01,428
old

446
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,159
how about blocking scripts okay well you

447
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:11,100
turn on script blocking go visit a new

448
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,820
site like CNN and you'll notice this

449
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:18,209
thing pop up whereas I think there's 45

450
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:22,049
scripts that tried to load when I hit

451
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:26,940
the first page and I don't know what

452
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:28,289
most of them are so what happens though

453
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,920
is when you block it and then you try to

454
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,960
navigate

455
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,020
site the site doesn't work anymore right

456
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,820
and if you blocked ads and cookies and

457
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,220
scripts you probably don't even see this

458
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,179
much you know to do these screenshots I

459
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,680
couldn't turn them all on at once

460
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,510
because there's nothing to show you it's

461
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,910
blank screens I can only do one at a

462
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:51,420
time well then what if you add on top of

463
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,860
that deciding to browse anonymously like

464
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,080
I don't want you to know where I'm

465
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,219
coming from well then they just say no

466
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,020
right we have to know where you're

467
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,340
coming from or you can't see our website

468
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,350
and then if we take all of this stuff

469
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,520
and put it together people have even

470
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,889
written books about it

471
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,840
right cookie scripts had surveillance

472
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:18,240
capitalism there's a reason why all this

473
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,879
stuff exists right because it's making

474
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,220
people money because people are getting

475
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,850
data from it because and it goes further

476
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:30,680
than that because then we start having

477
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:33,240
problems understanding what is true

478
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,010
because a lot of us look to the internet

479
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,540
now for truth this is where you get

480
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,610
information that's the promise right

481
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,649
that's the cool thing about the Internet

482
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,419
you know I rebuilt an engine over the

483
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,850
summer I did it with YouTube I've never

484
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,430
worked on a car in my life okay I have

485
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,740
no idea how to do that but I can watch a

486
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,630
video and I can do what that dude did

487
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,920
right so it's like having a master

488
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,380
mechanic behind you all the time that's

489
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,110
awesome okay I've learned so many things

490
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,660
in my career from the Internet and

491
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,370
that's really cool you know but now

492
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,990
somehow it just doesn't feel like a safe

493
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,239
place to be and I'm never sure what to

494
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,460
trust anymore right because they take

495
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,740
all of these components and it's not

496
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,450
just ads anymore it's not just a cookie

497
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,580
on your machine because I don't really

498
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,160
care about that you know it's not just

499
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,429
that they're tracking Who I am because

500
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,980
that's creepy and weird but even that

501
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,390
sometimes I can live with but then it

502
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,190
all comes together and I go and I look

503
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,130
for information and I get something that

504
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,480
I don't even know if it's real okay and

505
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,540
that's where things really get

506
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,950
interesting right there's some studies

507
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,480
that have been done and there's this

508
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,180
thing now called the search engine

509
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,610
manipulation effect okay and it's based

510
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,750
on all these things I just talked about

511
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,189
where because with what they

512
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,070
know about us and because of how they

513
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,260
manage and track our computers they

514
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,700
understand now how you're gonna respond

515
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,000
to things when they put it in front of

516
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,060
you okay and we've seen things like in

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,820
this this this study that was done in

518
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,860
2015 they could change people's position

519
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,240
on fracking by as much as thirty three

520
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:08,040
percent ok pro or con okay we've talked

521
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,420
to everybody familiar with election

522
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,639
interference all kinds of other things

523
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,230
that go on and that's based on this

524
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,340
stuff that I'm talking about right now

525
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,880
okay

526
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,620
and human nature a little bit and if you

527
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,720
want to see it in action any of you can

528
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,989
do this right so there's this fun little

529
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,400
game you can play with Google now if

530
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,200
probably won't work with most of the

531
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,970
people in the room because we all do the

532
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,710
same thing right we're kind of boring

533
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,360
it's like we're in technology we look at

534
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,880
security and privacy stuff you know

535
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,060
whatever but do it with somebody that

536
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,650
doesn't do what you do and go to Google

537
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:44,280
works especially well with the images

538
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:47,430
page right and search something and then

539
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,720
compare your results okay what they see

540
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,790
and what you see are not gonna be the

541
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,410
same thing you're gonna get a different

542
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,389
set of images you're gonna get a

543
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,240
different set of information because

544
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,160
it's curated to who they are it's

545
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,000
curated to their identity that we were

546
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,150
talking about earlier and now we're in a

547
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,890
place where like I said you don't know

548
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:13,800
what's true so before I jump a little

549
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,600
further into the dark web and I just

550
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,330
want to summarize you know these ideas

551
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,990
here of the importance of privacy

552
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,820
security decentralization and the

553
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,830
natural question then becomes why bother

554
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,669
with the dark web can't the Internet be

555
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,909
better can't we make it a better place

556
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,170
well maybe I don't know right there's

557
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,680
some things that are happening out there

558
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:40,580
there's some things that hopefully will

559
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,420
make it better we can talk about

560
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,550
technologies that are really promising

561
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,140
like blockchain there could be some

562
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,360
interesting applications of that that

563
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,340
allow it to function on the Internet in

564
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,409
a way that helps solve some of these

565
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,320
security privacy decentralization

566
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,820
problems

567
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,490
on how its implemented so that's wicked

568
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,408
cool and I'm excited about it

569
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,259
there can be information sharing right

570
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:03,700
just between people where we say here's

571
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:05,049
a good service here's something that's

572
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,179
ethical here's something that doesn't

573
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,860
track your data you know you should

574
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,630
really use DuckDuckGo instead of Google

575
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:15,340
or whatever it is that you decide to do

576
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:17,169
right so yeah maybe could help

577
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,299
there's watchdog groups out there like

578
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,860
the Electronic Frontier Foundation right

579
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:22,418
they're constantly looking at this stuff

580
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,519
they're looking at laws that are being

581
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,110
passed looking at technology companies

582
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,970
to see what their terms and conditions

583
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,519
look like are they violating people's

584
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,600
rights you know so there's some of that

585
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:37,990
that's going on - that could help

586
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,299
however we still have issues with the

587
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,129
Internet okay and the first one is a

588
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:44,740
name asymmetry of power and that stems

589
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:48,759
from that decentralization problem okay

590
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,669
I don't have the Internet in my house in

591
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,769
a box where I can control everything

592
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:56,019
about I depend on lots and lots of other

593
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:59,049
people I depend on those big five tech

594
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,769
companies to give me access to the World

595
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,690
Wide Web

596
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:03,580
I depend on that for my YouTube videos I

597
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:08,740
depend on that as I do research for this

598
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,570
talk right and if I don't like what

599
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:17,830
they're doing guess what I can do about

600
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:21,039
it any ideas yeah somebody give me a

601
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,259
better idea there's a lot of people in

602
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,330
here somebody's got a good idea right

603
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:27,519
what do you do decentralized so I

604
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,678
decentralized Amazon Facebook Apple

605
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:33,190
googa I have no control over that yeah

606
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,019
decentralization absolutely okay but I

607
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,740
can't do anything about it I can either

608
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:42,429
participate or not where's the choice in

609
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,279
that right and then there's a network

610
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:52,029
effect how many of you guys are on

611
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:56,500
Mastodon two three how many of you are

612
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:57,639
on Twitter a lot more hands how many of

613
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,139
you tried to get your friends to go to

614
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:03,870
Mastodon and nobody would go one right

615
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,979
we have Network effect issues

616
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,510
everybody's on the Internet there

617
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,559
are using all the stuff that's out there

618
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:13,419
who uses venmo there's a few of you yeah

619
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,918
who got your friend that has been Moe

620
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:20,290
installed on their phone to take Manero

621
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,429
instead nobody right it's a pain it's

622
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,139
like I don't want to download another

623
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,820
app connect my bank account to it all

624
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,950
this kind of so wherever people are

625
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,439
that's where the stuff is and that's

626
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,299
where everybody goes so we have a

627
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,200
problem in that all of this

628
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:37,090
decentralized not private not secured

629
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,640
stuff has all the people and nobody

630
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:43,330
wants to leave because the alternative

631
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,179
is useless all right you know and then

632
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:49,030
the last the last thing here and I

633
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,490
really can't read that lack of monetary

634
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,220
motivation right people are making money

635
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,720
at this stuff

636
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,429
okay there is no incentive if you

637
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,480
control it all and you're making lots

638
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:02,080
and lots of money on it

639
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,940
why would you change a thing you know

640
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,649
you can go sit in front of Congress all

641
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,390
day long and talk about privacy and just

642
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,360
not care because you're still cashing

643
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,830
checks bigger checks and their salary

644
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,439
and then the whole government makes

645
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,000
probably right so at a point you just

646
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,309
don't care you're gonna do whatever it

647
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,780
takes to keep the gravy train rolling

648
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:21,250
you're gonna say whatever they want to

649
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,299
hear and then go do what you want to do

650
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:28,299
and so even if we had some companies on

651
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:32,200
the internet decide yeah we'll do the

652
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:34,870
right thing you know hey Facebook Apple

653
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:45,970
right we're gonna protect your personal

654
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:47,080
information right how do you know what

655
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,730
can you do about it

656
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,320
do you know if Apple's protecting your

657
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,330
personal information i pinky swear but I

658
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,178
made another billion dollars off of

659
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,178
selling your data so I don't care right

660
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,559
like I said this all comes back to

661
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,290
choice and that's where the dark web

662
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:11,350
comes in that that's why I wanted to

663
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:14,950
talk today to the security community

664
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,360
about embracing the dark web because the

665
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,490
rest of the world is like the people I

666
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,870
described to begin with they whisper to

667
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:24,039
me have you ever been on the

668
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,229
well okay and years and years ago there

669
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:30,490
was this really cool little operating

670
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,220
system that people like called Linux and

671
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,789
it wasn't on anything

672
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:39,850
who here installed Linux like way back

673
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:43,120
okay my first in Linux and I wasn't

674
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:45,100
right right at the beginning but I was

675
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,709
rotating thirty to three and a half inch

676
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,789
floppy disks right because I wouldn't

677
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,409
hold enough and I didn't have enough

678
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:52,179
floppy disk to actually write it on it

679
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,130
so eyes rotating them is like I didn't

680
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,840
put one in install that piece of it and

681
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,940
and one I just took out I'd write with

682
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,399
the next segment of the image right and

683
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,260
so and it was really obnoxious and hard

684
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,000
you know and there were some famous

685
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,970
people in Linux community that talked

686
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,250
about just run a few shell scripts you

687
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,110
know you write some C code you know

688
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:19,120
pretty soon the thing works kind of on

689
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:22,658
some hardware maybe right but it was

690
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,178
really really hard and now I can stand

691
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,909
up in front of you guys I can walk into

692
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:31,210
a place like this I can plug my Linux

693
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:35,620
laptop in and it works and guess what I

694
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,789
installed it and I didn't install any

695
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,010
drivers it worked

696
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:40,330
power management works I can close the

697
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,549
thing and open it again and it still

698
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,110
works you know that's awesome because

699
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:46,029
for people that don't remember that was

700
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,789
a gamble you did not close on Linux

701
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:53,950
laptop all right you might have to

702
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:55,629
reinstall afterwards but that all

703
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,929
relates to the dark web because the dark

704
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:01,210
web is hard and scary right now and so

705
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,970
we need to do something about that

706
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,710
and technology and especially security

707
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,760
people the perfect people to do that

708
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,980
because who better to help you know

709
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,629
people get on to the dark web than

710
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,880
people that understand security because

711
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,140
there are things there you should avoid

712
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,789
who better to help people understand

713
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,679
privacy than people that have been

714
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,960
looking at privacy issues for as long as

715
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,340
technology's been around and hopefully

716
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,159
before if we remember that stuff

717
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,840
happened before us right or who better

718
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,940
to look at decentralization that people

719
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,939
that understand why that matters so

720
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,209
I'm gonna dig into just real quick some

721
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,280
of the dark web technologies because

722
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,570
that's not the focus of this talk but I

723
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,820
want to make sure that everybody has

724
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:47,139
enough information to walk away from

725
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,580
here and go do something so the first

726
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,410
thing to understand about the dark web

727
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,510
is there isn't one of them does

728
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,970
everybody understand that it's not just

729
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,370
the dark web

730
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,310
okay there's three major dark web

731
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,020
technologies and they don't necessarily

732
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,340
interoperate you know I mean you can

733
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,129
connect to some things from other things

734
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,470
but so the three the one most people

735
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,770
have heard about is tor okay so the

736
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,540
Onion Routing network so there's tor it

737
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,700
provides some things it gives you some

738
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,200
anonymity gives you some privacy gives

739
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,460
you some security it's got three layers

740
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,180
of encryption that it goes through when

741
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,720
it's making connections which is awesome

742
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,420
unfortunately it does have some

743
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,190
centralized aspects to it and I'll show

744
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,900
you an interesting thing when I get to

745
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:32,430
actually demoing some of the dark web in

746
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,900
a second that relates to centralization

747
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:39,400
the next technology is i2p

748
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,950
okay I 2p focuses again on anonymity or

749
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,690
privacy security they wanted to be

750
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,200
cooler than in tor so they did four

751
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,360
layers of encryption and they have some

752
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,110
decentralized self-organizing aspects to

753
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,330
the network now again the purpose of

754
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,620
this talk isn't to give you everything

755
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,750
and make you walk out of here as dark

756
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,159
web experts the purpose is for you to

757
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,170
take the slide right here and go learn

758
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,350
everybody in here is a security person

759
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:08,170
okay so I want you to give you a little

760
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,389
bit to go fish and then come back

761
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,770
hopefully next year you know and do your

762
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:15,069
own presentations on the cool thing you

763
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,139
did on the dark web but the last one is

764
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,940
free net free Nets a little bit

765
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:23,739
different okay it provides anonymity but

766
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,860
it's really focused on censorship

767
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:29,830
resistant communication okay and

768
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,410
publishing so free nuts really cool

769
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,600
because it provides anonymity it also

770
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:36,159
provides total decentralization there's

771
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,679
like a complete copy of everything

772
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,089
shared everywhere okay so you try to

773
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,219
take something down on free net it's

774
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,780
basically impossible

775
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,889
you could go raid the data center and

776
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,240
take all the servers out guess what

777
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,658
there's copies and every other data

778
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,449
center in the world

779
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,490
you're not getting very far but each one

780
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,589
of these has their own ideology if you

781
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,169
stucked or people on I to people and I

782
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,880
to people in a room there'd be a great

783
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,890
argument about why three versus four

784
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,830
layers of encryption about what the

785
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,509
better way is to do it whatever doesn't

786
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,130
matter to me at this point the point is

787
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,100
is that they all provide these features

788
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:15,790
and they all provide a choice which is

789
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:19,839
what I'm interested in a super simple

790
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:22,370
illustration of how tor works basically

791
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,770
tor network you connect to it and

792
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,029
there's a series of nodes and and the

793
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,590
way this works is that there's three

794
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,790
layers of encryption get peeled off as

795
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,580
you go through the notes so it starts

796
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,740
out with you and the next hop in the in

797
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,080
the network illustrated by the first

798
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,729
green computer there right and when you

799
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,259
connect to that it peels off that first

800
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,980
layer of encryption it says I know how

801
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,300
to talk here

802
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,650
well that computer then talks to the

803
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,080
next computer in the node and this stuff

804
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,370
is randomized and that peels off another

805
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,930
layer of encryption before it finally

806
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,370
gets to your exit node where it peels

807
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,950
off the last layer of encryption and

808
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:55,130
turns it loose on to the internet or the

809
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:58,129
Tor network or whatever it is okay so

810
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:01,190
this is basically how this works the

811
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,070
nodes only know the identity of the node

812
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,040
that preceded them okay so when you

813
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,270
connect to a resource on the Internet

814
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,830
you know when you went through all this

815
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,230
work to protect your identity and logged

816
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,720
into Facebook Facebook only knows the

817
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,570
red computer okay they don't know where

818
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,930
you started right and that's kind of the

819
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,940
idea behind this at a high level I to P

820
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,770
functions in a fairly similar way with

821
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,830
some technological differences like I

822
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:31,190
said that people will argue about a lot

823
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,170
free networks completely differently but

824
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,660
again the point isn't to dig into all of

825
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:41,300
their technical capabilities it's more

826
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:44,480
about this is generally what they do so

827
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,700
I want to take a minute to now to just

828
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,950
do a quick demo of what it looks like to

829
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,560
access the dark web okay because I want

830
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,359
to get rid of the whisper okay lots of

831
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,580
people you have you been on the dark web

832
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,430
yep in about five seconds all of you

833
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,500
will have done

834
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,419
all right so first thing I want to do is

835
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:15,390
bring up another time and be able to

836
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:18,329
read so first thing I'm gonna talk about

837
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,190
tour today because it's fairly

838
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:23,490
straightforward and people are familiar

839
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,779
with it go to tor project org first

840
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,129
thing that you're gonna see is gonna get

841
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:28,099
to this home page there's a download

842
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,940
link there download the tor browser

843
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:31,920
that's how that works

844
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,400
okay if you downloaded something before

845
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,890
you're good depending on what you use if

846
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,099
you use like a Linux distribution or

847
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,270
other distributions Mac works fine if

848
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,910
you download the browser you can also

849
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,009
install it from brew on Linux sometimes

850
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,328
it's in your package manager there's a

851
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,529
launcher that will go down and pull down

852
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:53,039
the latest version of the tor browser

853
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:55,319
whatever point is it's simple if you can

854
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,799
click it download link you're pretty

855
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:58,069
good

856
00:37:55,799 --> 00:38:00,509
the next step is going to be installing

857
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,490
okay if you've ever installed a piece of

858
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,430
software on your computer you're still

859
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,009
good okay so if we can get past these

860
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:14,098
two amazingly technologically difficult

861
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:17,640
URLs you can get on the dark web once we

862
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:20,700
get that done and you install it you get

863
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,759
a thing that looks like this if any of

864
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,529
you guys have ever used Firefox before

865
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,160
you're still not lost okay

866
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:30,539
the tor browser is based on firefox and

867
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,899
once you're here there's a few things

868
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:40,650
that you can do so again first thing i

869
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:46,260
want to do is verify that i'm actually

870
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:50,630
on tour okay congratulations i'm on tour

871
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:54,650
that's awesome now if i look back here

872
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,650
this is my regular browser

873
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:05,150
second one you think it have my

874
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,149
bookmarks memorized right

875
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,540
okay well we verified that one of these

876
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,890
browsers is using tor and one's not okay

877
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,170
so this is a good thing to do after you

878
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,400
connect people it's like if you're gonna

879
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,140
if you want to be anonymous you should

880
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,970
verify you're actually anonymous tor

881
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:27,560
project provides a page to check that

882
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:29,720
out all right so that's cool next thing

883
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:35,960
I can do is actually check where the

884
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:43,819
internet thinks I'm coming from which is

885
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:47,090
this link right here okay

886
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,620
IP location somebody that's looking at a

887
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:52,100
bigger screen than me tell me where I'm

888
00:39:48,620 --> 00:40:03,920
at Amsterdam awesome

889
00:39:52,100 --> 00:40:08,600
anybody here in Amsterdam yeah help me

890
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,580
out all right so my regularly configured

891
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,839
browser I assume so somewhere near Salt

892
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:17,840
Lake or Provo what's it

893
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:21,380
alright close enough right so we can see

894
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:26,030
here tor browser has just by installing

895
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,920
and using a different browser I'm able

896
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,800
to ensure that I'm connecting through

897
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,390
that series of nodes and that I'm it

898
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,380
looks like I'm coming from somewhere

899
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,569
other than I am

900
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,890
so I've handled a couple of things I've

901
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:42,280
dealt with some security and I've dealt

902
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:46,589
with some privacy anonymity right now I

903
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:51,450
think which one is that

904
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:53,640
that's a good one okay so once you get

905
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,580
on tour then what right I'm on the dark

906
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,240
web yay we've done it okay that's how

907
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:10,230
exciting it is and how difficult it is

908
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:11,879
so once you hear hope new time all right

909
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,110
what can you do well you can do a lot of

910
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,250
things that you do everywhere else

911
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:20,820
you want to look at the news okay fine

912
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:23,610
here's a wiki page okay this is the

913
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,050
hidden wiki I believe basically gives

914
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,190
you an index of a lot of stuff on the

915
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,820
dark web things you might find

916
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,040
interesting

917
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,780
okay kind of like what the internet used

918
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,460
to look like before search engines we

919
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,880
used to go to this page and check out

920
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,260
all the stuff now I don't want to waste

921
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,670
time trying to navigate all this stuff

922
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,780
because I can't see it but one of the

923
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,370
interesting things I was talking about

924
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,950
earlier is there's actually a note on

925
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,680
here you guys might be able to see some

926
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,509
of it up there the red letters probably

927
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,819
they were down for a few weeks okay

928
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,560
they're running on tour and there is a

929
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,180
massive bust over in Europe in their

930
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,310
data center for other people on the dark

931
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,710
web and they took all the servers in the

932
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,870
data center okay tor is not

933
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,170
decentralized is the thing that I

934
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,880
brought up earlier where I 2p and free

935
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,160
net have some decentralization aspects

936
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,840
to them so when the Fed showed up and

937
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,250
took all of the servers in the data

938
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,470
center even though these guys weren't

939
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,720
doing anything illegal they were kind of

940
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,220
swept up in the process and they're back

941
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,540
online now but it took a couple weeks

942
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,879
because they had to go find some new

943
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,860
servers okay if you've been running on

944
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,780
one of the other networks they have more

945
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,000
decent civilization and resiliency to

946
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,200
that something like free net this would

947
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,790
have never disappeared because it's

948
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,069
actually in a million copies all over to

949
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:41,100
the internet so you can look at indexes

950
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:46,140
of what is on the dark web we can look

951
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:48,210
at things like news so maybe you want to

952
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,480
look at news that hasn't been tailored

953
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:53,820
to your personal preferences you want to

954
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,350
hear other viewpoints instead of just

955
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,800
having your own personal biases

956
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,020
reinforced over and over again so you

957
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,170
have an option here

958
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:06,710
to go and look at a website that is a

959
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,780
major reporting agency throughout the

960
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,640
world and you're gonna get first tier

961
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,350
news but without any of it being

962
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,230
customized to you you're just gonna see

963
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:19,670
the news okay and there's lots of

964
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:21,260
resources like this on the dark web I've

965
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:23,330
got a whole list of them here and I'm

966
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:27,410
not gonna go through each of them but

967
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:29,720
you can go to DuckDuckGo from tor so

968
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,540
you're hiding and browsing privately

969
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,859
anonymously right and take that extra

970
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,660
step to make sure that even though

971
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,760
DuckDuckGo says that they don't track

972
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,339
your information they definitely cannot

973
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,900
if you're doing it through tor and that

974
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,170
brings up another point that i think is

975
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,860
really important here which is my hope

976
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,650
is that through usage of the dark web it

977
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:58,040
gives each of us a tool to get beyond

978
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,840
the pinkie-swear right if a company says

979
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,450
like DuckDuckGo we're not tracking you

980
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,359
then it should not matter if i use your

981
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:09,500
site anonymously if I turn off ads

982
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,779
cookies you know scripts and I get there

983
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:15,170
from a place you can't track your site

984
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,480
should function exactly the same way as

985
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,480
it does if I go there from another

986
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,300
Avenue right which gives us a little bit

987
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,250
of power back because now we can use

988
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,080
this to make the internet a better place

989
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,390
we can use this to hold companies

990
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,310
accountable if they say that they're not

991
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:34,430
selling our data or they're not abusing

992
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:36,259
our privacy right because what's gonna

993
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,180
happen is we've been able to take some

994
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,880
level of control about how we interact

995
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,020
and prove that they're not doing those

996
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,020
things because it still functions

997
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,050
all right so I want to talk about a call

998
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:04,099
to action and this is where we're gonna

999
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:06,440
finish up I'm gonna take you back in

1000
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:11,270
history again just for a minute okay to

1001
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:15,980
Amsterdam in 1943 Amsterdam had been

1002
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:18,680
innovated by the Nazi Party and the Nazi

1003
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:22,000
Party had been rounding up Jews in

1004
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,129
Amsterdam with incredible effectiveness

1005
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,700
and the reason why was because there was

1006
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:31,190
a public register there that had very

1007
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,828
detailed information on every single

1008
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,849
person that lived in the city including

1009
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:44,050
their nationality or ethnicity and so as

1010
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:46,130
a result of that the Jews had no chance

1011
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,500
okay there were pictures

1012
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,200
you couldn't pose as somebody else you

1013
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,410
couldn't offer a fake ID you couldn't go

1014
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,399
get food somewhere else right because of

1015
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,540
the detailed information that was there

1016
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:04,730
now there was a group of people in

1017
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:09,950
Amsterdam that was aware of this and it

1018
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:14,980
was a teacher it was a doctor it was a

1019
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:17,960
couple of students there was a tailor

1020
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:20,210
all in all there's about 27 of them I

1021
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,819
believe if I remember correctly that

1022
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:26,720
decided that they had to do something

1023
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:29,720
about this okay it wasn't the army it

1024
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,629
wasn't trained soldiers it was normal

1025
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,308
people they put together a plan and said

1026
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,230
we don't want to hurt anybody we're not

1027
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:40,220
in this as combat we just need to stop

1028
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:43,069
what's happening right so they hatched

1029
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,078
this plan where they would sneak into

1030
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:48,079
the public register which was under Nazi

1031
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,369
guard they would knock the guards out

1032
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,599
they had a doctor with him who could

1033
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:54,380
actually administer some stuff they

1034
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,940
didn't want to harm anybody so and they

1035
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,200
had a tailor that made policeman

1036
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,180
uniforms for them so they looked

1037
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,029
official and they wouldn't be suspicious

1038
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,990
right away when they walked in the door

1039
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:08,359
and so they waited until nighttime and

1040
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:10,410
they went in knocked the guards out and

1041
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:14,430
poured kerosene

1042
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,859
all over the records then they lit it

1043
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,940
all on fire

1044
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,590
well they had also coordinated with the

1045
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:23,370
fire department they said don't show up

1046
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:25,920
right away okay and then when they did

1047
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:30,270
and they said use a lot of water let's

1048
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,970
make sure we finish this off and so a

1049
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:35,430
bunch of normal people saw something

1050
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,129
that wasn't working right and decided to

1051
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:42,870
do something about it and they destroyed

1052
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:44,880
the amsterdam public register and so

1053
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,310
that's what I'd like to do today I'd

1054
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,260
like to have each of you decide to do

1055
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:50,580
something about it because one of the

1056
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,710
problems that we have right now with the

1057
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,750
dark web is that it's hard okay it's

1058
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,550
hard to get to I showed you something

1059
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,770
pretty easy but for non-technology

1060
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:00,300
people they're not gonna go do that

1061
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:03,200
because they don't they wouldn't even

1062
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:06,900
know where to start so they need us to

1063
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,100
facilitate that process this little box

1064
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,540
that I'm showing right here is something

1065
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,279
I have at home I love this thing it fits

1066
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,590
in my hand it's got a network port on

1067
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,240
each end okay and I can use it in line

1068
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,460
or it's actually a wireless access point

1069
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,200
so in my house if you connect to that

1070
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,620
wireless network you're automatically on

1071
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,620
VPN and tor no configuration necessary

1072
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,750
super simple anybody in my house knows

1073
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,770
how to connect to a Wi-Fi network these

1074
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,030
types of things make stuff easy you know

1075
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,710
it's a little difficult right now to

1076
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,840
create content for the dark web there's

1077
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,640
not a lot that's useful up there you

1078
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,100
know maybe somebody should create a Wix

1079
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,629
or Weebly for the dark web wouldn't take

1080
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,940
more than you know a couple hours worth

1081
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,640
of scripting to make that happen okay

1082
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:51,750
and we have the skills to do that right

1083
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,040
my mother-in-law does not so this is

1084
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,550
what I'd like to leave you with today

1085
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,970
I'd like you to walk out of here and go

1086
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:02,040
use the dark web okay do what you can do

1087
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,450
if you grade it right in software write

1088
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,130
some cool software that makes the dark

1089
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:07,980
web easier if you like hardware build a

1090
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,540
cool device if you aren't technical at

1091
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,040
all and you just like security and you

1092
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,650
think this is important go read a book

1093
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
and talk to somebody about it right tell

1094
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,130
them that privacy matters

1095
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,080
tell them why decentralization is

1096
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:21,950
important and tell them why we want our

1097
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,950
data to be secure

1098
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:29,029
that's it go play on the dark web thanks

1099
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,030
for coming

1100
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:42,900
I think I've got just a couple minutes

1101
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:46,589
if there isn't yeah that's called an

1102
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,359
anon abox okay so it's basically just a

1103
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:50,369
single board computer in there and you

1104
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:53,848
can build your own I purchase that one

1105
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:55,500
because it's super easy but yeah it's

1106
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:57,569
just any single board computer you could

1107
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,980
do it with Raspberry Pi you could do it

1108
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:14,430
with a Lena whatever you want anybody

1109
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:16,500
else yep mmhmm yeah speeds definitely an

1110
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,720
issue and I would I found now is it

1111
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,190
depends on the site so you see that

1112
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,410
people that are hosting in better

1113
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:24,240
locations like DuckDuckGo is super fast

1114
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,000
right they're a corporation that's

1115
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,919
enabling people on the dark web some of

1116
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,710
these independent news sites or like a

1117
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:42,660
social media site they're still terrible

1118
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:44,130
they're not super fast yeah yeah and

1119
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,899
that comes down to the network effect

1120
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,089
right so that's a real problem

1121
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,910
that that's like I try to browse things

1122
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:52,140
from tor and they're like nope and I

1123
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,910
found this very interesting when I was

1124
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,240
researching some of this I went to a lot

1125
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:58,740
of state government websites most of

1126
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,169
them let me in okay Utah was like yeah

1127
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,689
no problem I don't care New York City

1128
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,220
was fine Texas at the time had just been

1129
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:07,079
hit with that massive ransomware attack

1130
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,569
they were like nope you're not getting

1131
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,790
anywhere near us right so I mean that's

1132
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:14,550
definitely an issue but I think it's an

1133
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:17,220
issue that's addressable through usage

1134
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,510
okay it's that network effect I talked

1135
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,220
about if there's enough people there

1136
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,630
that they have to account for it then

1137
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,009
they will account for it but until that

1138
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:27,510
exists then there's always gonna be

1139
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:32,240
things we can't access this way anybody

1140
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,240
else yeah

1141
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,820
um probably I don't I mean I think I've

1142
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,680
been on the FBI watch list for about 20

1143
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,330
years because of my career and it's like

1144
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,040
I subscribed to Linux magazines and

1145
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:50,500
don't have social networking accounts

1146
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,810
but you know all of that puts you on the

1147
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,550
list just downloading the software I

1148
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,799
don't think necessarily puts you on any

1149
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,390
list you can easily use a VPN or some

1150
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,890
other technology to go download the

1151
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,930
software and at least get some level of

1152
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:05,020
anonymity right until you make the

1153
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,940
connections there is certain content on

1154
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,250
the dark web that absolutely I mean

1155
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,110
unequivocally do not view do not go pass

1156
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,730
go that will get you in trouble and I'm

1157
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,350
not gonna talk about what that is but I

1158
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,630
think anybody that has any understanding

1159
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,029
of the law would know when they're

1160
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:25,930
crossing some lines pretty quickly yeah

1161
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:28,090
I have at times I don't currently and I

1162
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,799
would like to again in the future I'm

1163
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,300
actually working a lot right now I want

1164
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,590
to create content for the dark web so

1165
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,240
that's where I'm focusing my efforts

1166
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:45,000
right now as opposed to exit notes but

1167
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:45,000
yeah ya know that's power chords yep yep

1168
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,810
uh-huh sure

1169
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:03,400
yep I agree with you and Mozilla by

1170
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:06,249
default I mean you can just change go to

1171
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,719
about config you can make Firefox access

1172
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09,819
tour site so you don't have to download

1173
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:10,989
the tor browser the reason why I say to

1174
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,670
do that is because it's got other

1175
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:19,440
configuration in there that plug-in

1176
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:19,440
security things like that that helps yep

1177
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:26,769
yeah cool all right I think we need to

1178
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:29,500
get out of here so the next guy can get

1179
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:33,848
going but thank you guys

1180
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,849
[Applause]

1181
