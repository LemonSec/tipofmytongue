1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
okay awesome mm-hmm

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,000
we'll get started here

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,820
my name is Dallin Warren thank you for

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,370
coming here I'm here to answer a

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,260
question and support that answer here if

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,240
you want to follow along you know on

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,130
your own device you know look up the QR

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,299
code here or go to the the link I'm

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,240
gonna have it up for just a moment

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,650
longer I find that it's helpful to be

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,060
able to follow along on your own devices

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,070
that have taken a you know a picture

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,529
every time you know the slide changes or

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,600
something so yeah you can follow along

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,399
there or you know just right on the

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,350
screen I'm getting over a cold and so

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,510
there's still some side-effects there I

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,320
don't think I'll lose my voice again at

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,199
this point but if I need to pause for a

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,480
moment you'll know why thankfully I have

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,760
some water up here and stuff so a little

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,680
bit about me my background is in

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,329
networking I started out network

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,690
operations center moved over to network

25
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,400
engineering and did some network

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:11,939
security there and ended up go on to

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,340
doing security engineering for the three

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,470
BYU schools you know one here in Provo

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,090
and then Hawaii and Idaho as well and

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,280
that's where I am currently so I've been

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,189
doing at least in the networking area

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,960
for for several years and then I'm in

33
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,229
the last few years it's just focusing

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
more on the cybersecurity side of things

35
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,579
but you know that's a little bit about

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,920
me but I want to also get a feel for the

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,649
people here in the audience here I'm

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,450
just by show of hands how many just

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,310
going through the industries of what we

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,220
have here how many of you are in health

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,020
care health care industry quite a few up

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,380
here and some in the back

43
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,810
what about education yeah I'm in the

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,030
education of course government any

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:03,450
government a couple retail

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:06,060
I'm not mention retail finance tech do

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,179
we have any yeah a lot in tech any

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,410
others that I miss that you guys want to

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,629
you know give a shout out to your

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,340
industry for okay so we have a good

51
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,179
amount

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,060
diversity here from the different

53
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,220
industries now how many do you have some

54
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,800
form of network security monitoring

55
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,109
whether it's a firewall or a intrusion

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,630
detection system how many have some type

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,600
of network security okay you know that a

58
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,150
show of hands is pretty good there if

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,710
you don't you will talk a little bit

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,570
about it here now how many of you don't

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,480
really focus on your network security

62
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,370
because of encryption it's just not a

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,640
priority because it's like well I you

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,400
know I see a few of these out there yeah

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,890
I mean encryption is it's really changed

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,380
never networking in general but network

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,809
security especially in cyber security

68
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,170
I know it's everywhere it's it's

69
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,180
expected if your company isn't doing it

70
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,869
and you know people start to wonder you

71
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:12,370
know is your company really putting my

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,460
my data in I'm sorry am I putting my

73
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,810
data in safe hands with this company

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,570
other reasons why it's everywhere the

75
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:23,140
the cost of doing of enabling security

76
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:26,079
or SSL it just drop a lot in the last

77
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,540
you know five years especially because

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,370
you know you have let's encrypt that you

79
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,400
can literally get a certificate for free

80
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,620
now you have them championing protocols

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,840
like the acne or you know it's different

82
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,970
BOTS I'll automatically renew those

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,090
certificates so you don't have to you

84
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,570
know worry about them so it's easier to

85
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,790
implement you know 20 years ago there is

86
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,420
some concern about well encryption will

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,890
hit our you know CPU and it might slow

88
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,500
down our servers and stuff it that's

89
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,670
really not the case today there's a lot

90
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,390
of improvements and strides that have

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,309
happened there and so this we can see

92
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,600
that that trend over the last few years

93
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,390
of just the adoption of SSL on on

94
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,019
websites right so this is just the graph

95
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,810
a time graph of Chrome and just showing

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,519
at least in the United States we you

97
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,880
know five four years ago we were about

98
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,159
45 percent of pages were loaded over SSL

99
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,340
and now it's you know 92 percent as of a

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,320
couple weeks ago you know they're 92

101
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,580
since a lot these days so it's you know

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,120
with network security it's looking

103
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,789
pretty bleak right and it raises the

104
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,970
question with a lot of a lot of security

105
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,880
teams a lot of organizations of do I

106
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,940
invest in network security at this point

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,940
with you know 92 send these pages being

108
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,750
loaded over HTTPS what value does it

109
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,669
really give me it

110
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,699
you know at this point so is network

111
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,698
security monitoring dead and you know it

112
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:01,810
is dead you know so but that's that guy

113
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:03,700
okay now it's not dead you know I'm big

114
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,450
Simpsons fans any other Simpsons fans in

115
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,360
here wait all right nice yeah you know

116
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,940
we quantum computing Mike you know at

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,160
least dramatically change or kill it but

118
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,900
today in this day and age we're actually

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,270
still you know network security

120
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,500
monitoring is still going pretty strong

121
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,870
now don't get me wrong encryption does

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,990
reduce the visibility and it does affect

123
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:30,699
it but doesn't eliminate it and mosz

124
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,840
security teams to evolve how they're

125
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,930
doing that

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,929
that monitoring of their network now I

127
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,270
wanted to touch on five reasons why it's

128
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,889
not dead we're going to hit reason

129
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,200
number one pretty pretty hard and a

130
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,789
little bit more in depth because if we

131
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,430
don't then the other reasons don't make

132
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:51,099
quite as much sense but the first reason

133
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,160
is not everything is encrypted or is

134
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:56,650
going to be encrypted in the new future

135
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,520
and you can still find a really good

136
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,888
value of of that data here so why isn't

137
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,590
everything encrypted yet or will be in

138
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,150
the next you know a year or two and well

139
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,280
you still have a lot well there's

140
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,630
there's a few main things you have

141
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,049
legacy devices legacy apps you have

142
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,820
shadow itu and you have you know one

143
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,320
offs on your network right you have that

144
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,530
server that was just built for this one

145
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,270
purpose one thing that it just doesn't

146
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,250
quite fit with everything else you know

147
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,280
you had a special for whatever reason

148
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:33,550
and and so you get just a variety of

149
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,380
things that makes it difficult to turn

150
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,840
on SSL everywhere right another going

151
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,050
back to that legacy apps and stuff you

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,960
know

153
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,400
your company might have bought some very

154
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,710
expensive equipment you know if it's a

155
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,810
medicine it might be you know a dozen

156
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,849
MRI machines and you only have a budget

157
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,610
every you know 15 years for those or

158
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,770
something in university setting we we

159
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,650
see a lot of like astronomy equipment or

160
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,810
physics equipment that you know is

161
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:06,729
bought in the 90s and the apps were made

162
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:08,349
for Windows 95 or older and they you

163
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,389
know they were not that universities not

164
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:12,759
willing to spend or they can't get grant

165
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,080
money to spend you know fifty million

166
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,310
dollars for another piece of equipment

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,250
right and so that those persists another

168
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,590
a few other reasons a little bit more in

169
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,430
the technical areas there's still areas

170
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,150
that are hard to adequately actually do

171
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,000
it right

172
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,909
the encryption SMB is a good example

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,060
syslog I mean most your syslog stuff is

174
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:39,520
UDP and you send it to you know in five

175
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,360
fourteen on some syslog server somewhere

176
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,969
right there's very often there's not any

177
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,680
options for doing some type of

178
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:50,020
encryption there and if there is it's

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,130
not guaranteed your your syslog receiver

180
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,659
is going to be able to support it either

181
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,490
another couple of reasons it's you might

182
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,659
have a low return on investment you know

183
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,729
you might put in a lot of work to

184
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,469
encrypt that traffic but does it really

185
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,680
give you does it really lower your risk

186
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,479
much I mean look at if you have a web

187
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,879
server and a database server and they're

188
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,650
both you know in racks in the same row

189
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,620
and your data center and they're locked

190
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,989
and stuff it does it really what value

191
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,139
does it really bring to keep that that

192
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,789
that traffic in the backend encrypted or

193
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,430
you might have performance it's I mean

194
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,090
tor is a privacy advocates dream right

195
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,389
you know

196
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,638
layer upon layer of encryption and and

197
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,948
one node not knowing much about the

198
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,799
other but didn't you try and use it and

199
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:39,939
you're only getting like 56k right it's

200
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:42,968
not usable for the for most purposes or

201
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,550
or you know your IT or sysadmin just

202
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,399
wants to get an app working or service

203
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,430
working and they just don't you know I

204
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,020
think about the security side of things

205
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,859
so yeah 92% of that US traffic

206
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,630
web traffic is encrypted but 8% can

207
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,790
still be a lot you know if you have a 10

208
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,370
gig is P link assuming it's saturated

209
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,760
with web traffic you know that that's

210
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,050
still 800 Meg's per second that that's

211
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
not encrypted that's still quite a bit

212
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,790
or if you you know it might be 400 if

213
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,010
you have a 5 gig link and and web

214
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,260
traffic is not all the security

215
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,160
professionals security analyst care

216
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:25,069
about you know SMB is as always talked

217
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,860
about and everyone you know needs to

218
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,390
have their eyes on it and often it might

219
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,410
not be encrypted in a lot of

220
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,689
environments DNS is a big one as well

221
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:39,400
you also have the headers of some of

222
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,290
these layer 4 conversations and stuff

223
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,370
also you're not going to encrypt your

224
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:49,490
MAC address or your your IP addresses

225
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:54,080
and stuff so this is a kind of a

226
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:57,020
breakdown by protocol of an enterprise

227
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,330
environment and you can see again SSL is

228
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,250
is basically I get like a pac-man eating

229
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,610
up everything else right on this pie

230
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,990
chart yes it is dominant you still have

231
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,930
a few of those other protocols you still

232
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,880
see a little bit HTTP traffic but let's

233
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,709
see what happens instead of measuring by

234
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:19,189
by its what if we measured by session

235
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:20,840
count DNS explodes okay now I know UDP

236
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,220
is not session based but for you know

237
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,580
stateful firewalls and security

238
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,230
monitoring we kind of counter that way

239
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,020
so you have a ton of DNS traffic out

240
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,910
there and that's you know immensely

241
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:36,199
valuable to your security analysts and

242
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,579
so let's let's dive in a little bit

243
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,100
deeper on on DNS here what value does it

244
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,360
bring to a sock what Valley does it

245
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,390
bring to an organization to be

246
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,610
monitoring your network for DNS traffic

247
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,890
well first of all you can grab a lot of

248
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,830
good stats and performance monitoring

249
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,110
I'll tell you right now a lot of the top

250
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,360
queries I've seen in a in these

251
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,590
environments I've worked in or due to

252
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,470
either misconfigured servers or devices

253
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:08,080
bad software or they decommission some

254
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,300
you know

255
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,220
some some server that helps manage some

256
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,109
of these end points and stuff but the

257
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,830
end points they still trying to call

258
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,420
home to that old server great place

259
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,010
because - for security analyst to

260
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,660
investigate a little bit because if if

261
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,069
those things are outdated then it's

262
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,810
likely there's other security

263
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,160
vulnerabilities there right not to

264
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,869
mention your network team loves that

265
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,270
when when you give them some information

266
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,880
that helps improve their their their

267
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,620
performance you can find machines that

268
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,130
are not using your approved DNS servers

269
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,950
a big one is just any new domains or

270
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:46,280
malicious domains you can identify those

271
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,800
with your network security monitoring DJ

272
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,829
domains and tunneling and stuff those

273
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,829
are have been hitting the headlines for

274
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,850
the last couple years on malware that

275
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:01,790
and threat actors are doing that and I

276
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,940
investigated a phishing incident a few

277
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,680
months ago where the phishing domain was

278
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,710
registered six minutes before the first

279
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,469
emails were sent out so I mean new

280
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,490
domains or known phishing or malware

281
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:19,130
domains are still valuable and huge for

282
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,580
your security analysts what are the ways

283
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,580
that you can implement some protection

284
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:29,510
mechanisms on DNS is through DNS sink

285
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:32,540
holing basically you have a maybe a list

286
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,220
of known bad domains you know they're

287
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,410
tied to different malware families or

288
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,220
something and you have some some type of

289
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,660
security device often a firewall or IPs

290
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,790
that will basically men in the middle

291
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,209
those DNS requests when when they see

292
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,760
them and instead of you know responding

293
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,220
with actual IP of that bad server it

294
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,290
responds to a benign server that

295
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,630
probably you control or you know someone

296
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:02,930
controls and so now you can now win that

297
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,520
client here make sure that yet that pops

298
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,520
up now when that client tries to make a

299
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,189
HTTP or HTTPS requests it's going to hit

300
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,230
your sink hole server and you can look

301
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:16,330
at what it's actually trying to hit the

302
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,980
actual domain like in this example here

303
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,780
on the right we see a couple old domains

304
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,210
that we're seeing hold

305
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,770
the IPS decided they're probably not

306
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,410
very good

307
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,720
and so we've stood up a web server there

308
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,030
too so that you know a connection could

309
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,950
be made and that that request to a

310
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,230
server can be made so that our

311
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,080
monitoring can pick it up now we can go

312
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,490
back to the system owner and and I'd you

313
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,170
know say hey look it looks like you have

314
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,760
this type of malware on here based on

315
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,040
these you know DNS requests that's

316
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,490
making and trying to reach out to now I

317
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,660
want to pause here just for a moment my

318
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,150
throughout this part of the presentation

319
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,310
I talked about general principles but to

320
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,770
me it's helpful when I can tie them down

321
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,829
to earth to actual practical

322
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,300
applications things that I can do we

323
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,360
know when I return to work after the

324
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,150
conference and stuff and so I focus on a

325
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,210
couple more well-known tools Palo Alto

326
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:18,110
Networks firewalls and Zeke or formerly

327
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,990
bro these are tools there's other tools

328
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,540
available each one I I feel has their

329
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,950
pros and cons I just happen to pick

330
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,449
these because these are a little bit

331
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:32,920
more popular here's a good DNS tunneling

332
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,210
example of what your monitoring can do

333
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,420
on the right it's supposed to be DNS

334
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,560
queries and I don't I mean I don't know

335
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,099
about you I don't think any of those

336
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,260
really look right you can with your

337
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,570
security monitoring you can measure the

338
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,210
entropy of those DNS requests you can

339
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:54,190
look at abnormalities and those queries

340
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:56,360
and that's a really good flag that you

341
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,010
might have some type of tunneling or

342
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,460
data exfiltration on your network going

343
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:05,230
on just for a reference here the entropy

344
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,880
of what's considered high is about a 3.5

345
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,670
and these are you know in the high fours

346
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,920
two fives five range so not normal at

347
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:17,870
all just a couple more examples here you

348
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,219
know feel free to look at at them on

349
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,440
your screen if you're following along on

350
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,050
your device we've already talked about

351
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,640
some different DNS protections that Palo

352
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,130
Alto can give from you know sting

353
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,060
cooling and their new version 9.0 they

354
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,740
they have the additional DNS security

355
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,800
capabilities to

356
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,040
kind of shut that down and in Zeke has

357
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,150
some basically the same capabilities can

358
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,370
give you a little bit more insight

359
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,620
though now I just want to note just real

360
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,540
quick on DNS yeah there's a lot of

361
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,570
conversations going on about DNS over

362
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,230
HTTP right now right I just want to

363
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,080
touch others

364
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,430
yeah comfort some controversy but it

365
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,820
looks like for the most part you can

366
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,260
maintain DNS visibility in your network

367
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,530
I'm not going to go too much into depth

368
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,439
there's a session later this week that

369
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,780
will go more into depth on that I'll let

370
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,590
them you know you can ask your questions

371
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,060
and stuff there no no another example

372
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,540
you know let's look at SSL and TLS

373
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,479
itself what value can your sock get from

374
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,000
that well often clients you know whether

375
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,330
it's the actual web browser or maybe

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,320
it's their email client or something

377
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,440
they were going to try and hit the

378
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,640
domain first over HTTP very often and

379
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,920
then you're you know the servers will

380
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:39,500
redirect them right if they do support

381
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,810
HTTPS so you can find often what what we

382
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,670
or elles are actually trying to hit and

383
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,680
then you can there a lot of the tools

384
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,650
these days or have some type of metadata

385
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,229
analysis for example the the s and I

386
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:54,620
this is how Palo Alto Networks Homme

387
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,320
does their URL logging for HTTP sessions

388
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,880
is they look at the s and I or the the

389
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,740
server name indicator that the client

390
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,650
you know requests and yeah and TLS 1.3

391
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,510
there's some movement to get that

392
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,920
encrypted along with other pieces of the

393
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:16,099
handshake it's kind of complex it's not

394
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,510
as just a flip of switch and so they you

395
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,050
know watch the adoption rate it's not

396
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,629
going to happen

397
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,700
very quickly at least the next year or

398
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,390
two or you know maybe in your next

399
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,760
purchase cycle probably won't so you

400
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,430
know watch that there's probably going

401
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,740
to be some ways to either downgrade

402
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,480
those types of requests or you might

403
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,200
even be able to block it in your your

404
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,180
DNS servers so that there's still force

405
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,260
your clients are still forced to send

406
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,060
that unencrypted sni there you can

407
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,610
certificate information is also a

408
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,419
goldmine

409
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,850
for threat intelligence you can profile

410
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,030
BLET websites again are hosting search

411
00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:00,000
and certificates ja3 hashes anyone know

412
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:03,540
what ja3 is in here it's pretty new

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,420
sales force has been piloting or pushing

414
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,159
this basically you take a hash of the

415
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:13,110
the client handshake in the server

416
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,820
handshake and and you compare those

417
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,340
hashes against known malware

418
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,510
fingerprints because now we're being

419
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,459
automated they tend to do the same

420
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,720
things in the same way right so they're

421
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,640
going to reach out to their command and

422
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,620
control servers the same way and the

423
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,360
command and control servers are going to

424
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,000
respond the same way so that's another

425
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,459
way to of an indicator of compromise is

426
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,900
looking at the ja3 hashes and then

427
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,880
there's other organizations looking at

428
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,390
encrypted analytics this goes pioneering

429
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,490
that so they're it's not like we're

430
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,090
completely blind when something is

431
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,570
wrapped in SSL there's still some some

432
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,149
ways to get some good data out of that

433
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,610
here's an example of the power out the

434
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,680
botnet report just a few lines I've non

435
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,679
remised the data the domains are from

436
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:03,180
known a motet command and control

437
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:06,090
domains but it's example of Palo Alto

438
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,060
using that that unencrypted s and hi to

439
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,899
generate reports and to give analyst

440
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:15,360
data of what might be compromised this

441
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,790
is an example of the Zeke SSL log this

442
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,669
is also valuable for engineers and

443
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,680
analysts if you want to know if you have

444
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,930
any SSL 3 on your network you think you

445
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,320
don't but you know you need to confirm

446
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,390
it well you can you know write queries

447
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,179
against the the version field and and

448
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,990
see oh yeah we we do or we don't or what

449
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,270
server is hosting it or not we have the

450
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,780
the ja3 hashes that I was mentioning

451
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:44,490
here if your organization's supposed to

452
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:48,180
be using a standard certificate

453
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:54,060
authority you can also check that as

454
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:56,150
well in in these Zeke logs here I've

455
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,560
already kind of briefly touched on these

456
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,570
so I'm going to move on to kind of the

457
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,049
final section of reason number one

458
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,408
before

459
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:06,539
move on to the other reasons so let's

460
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,200
say you know if everything else is

461
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,669
encrypted

462
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,919
you know layer seven is all encrypted

463
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,169
and stuff what value we're currently can

464
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,269
you still get from it well MAC addresses

465
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,950
or are still pretty valuable you have

466
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,429
companies that that do a lot of

467
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:23,190
profiling of IOT and have just endpoints

468
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:26,100
in general and MAC addresses play into

469
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:30,899
that along with other you know behavior

470
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,699
characteristics VLANs can help security

471
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:34,678
analysts identify if you know

472
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,629
conversations between networks whether

473
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,960
this should be happening or not

474
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:41,519
IP addresses you know as as much as we

475
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,700
might do all these behavior analytics

476
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,580
and and fancy threat intelligence and

477
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,279
stuff there's always going to be some

478
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:55,230
type of IP list either it's a block or

479
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:57,029
to consider suspicious it your IP is

480
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,840
probably not going to be unencrypted

481
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:02,249
anytime soon or encrypted anytime soon

482
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,129
geolocation is also good on that it's

483
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,149
not perfect but if you can put in you

484
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,969
know if you don't have any business with

485
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:12,418
Iran go ahead and put in your firewall

486
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,509
to block or at least limit what Iran can

487
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:19,350
hit on your network right couple other

488
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,879
things if you know all else fails I'm

489
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,668
not a big fan of net flow data for

490
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,379
security incident response but you know

491
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,720
if you're investigating a breach or

492
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:30,509
something any data to help paint a

493
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,070
picture is helpful because if you maybe

494
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:36,210
you're you have a database server that

495
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:38,220
was breached it has a 200 gig database

496
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,100
on there but you only see one Meg of

497
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,289
traffic leaving you know the network

498
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,359
that is a good indicator that that data

499
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,549
was probably kept safe either they only

500
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,639
got a sample of it or they didn't take

501
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:53,519
it all right and then there's a lot of

502
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:55,889
research as well into IP based pattern

503
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,929
so you know maybe for persistence some

504
00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:05,070
some malware dropped or set up a cron

505
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:07,019
job or a schedule task and that's that's

506
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,200
running every five minutes or 15 minutes

507
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,269
or you know every periodically there's

508
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,909
there's some some ways that you can look

509
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:16,799
for that type of behavior

510
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:20,220
I did forget to mention if you guys have

511
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,690
any questions raise your hand I I'm feel

512
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,210
free to do you know kind of interrupt me

513
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:30,090
as I go along here so tool analysis just

514
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:33,359
on on you know your basic layer 3 layer

515
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,889
forward type of connections you still go

516
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,840
again you get a lot of that data in

517
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:39,090
these these different types of logs you

518
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,728
can protect your network and in this way

519
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,228
I I did put on the SSH log for Zeke

520
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:45,359
because yeah even though it's it's

521
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:49,049
completely you know it's SSH it's

522
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,139
encrypted you can still pull metrics or

523
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,269
information at even getting pretty good

524
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:59,789
guesses on whether a connection was

525
00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:01,679
successfully authenticated or not excuse

526
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:03,869
me

527
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,190
alright so that was reason why again we

528
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,129
went in depth a little bit because now

529
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,330
now you get the feeling that yes you

530
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:12,539
know there's a lot of unencrypted data

531
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:16,399
on the wire that can still provide me

532
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:18,840
and the sock a lot of good value there

533
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:20,189
that's not you know we only touched on a

534
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,499
few points there's plenty of others that

535
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:27,779
you that you can get some good insights

536
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:29,340
out of and yeah those are just a few so

537
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,149
reason number two the network itself

538
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,158
needs protecting right because if you

539
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,379
know there's still like DDoS attacks out

540
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,139
there there's still other ways to

541
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:43,228
manipulate packets or it just caused

542
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:46,199
things to go a little a little weird and

543
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:47,609
stuff so you got to properly segment

544
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,229
your network I mean I know that's

545
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,090
probably been the advice for Less you

546
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:55,739
know at least for the last five years

547
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:57,720
and probably longer you also have the

548
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:59,489
the DDoS protection or das protection

549
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,720
resource protection recon protection

550
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:03,419
that that comes with your Palo Alto

551
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,929
firewalls that you can turn on and in

552
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:09,299
tune and also look at your outbound

553
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,739
traffic you don't you know if you have

554
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,918
workstations that are compromised

555
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:15,479
sending out thousands of spam emails

556
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,889
every you know a few seconds or

557
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:20,039
something you're going to end up on

558
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,869
block lists and you don't want to deal

559
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,789
with the users calling in saying hey why

560
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:26,789
can't they access you know these

561
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:29,820
websites that I that I could ten minutes

562
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,860
ago and I need to do them for my

563
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:37,409
so you know wash that outbound traffic

564
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:40,889
as well reason number three inventory

565
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:43,559
and profiling so every every secure

566
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:46,740
cybersecurity framework they list some

567
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,309
type of inventory or identifying what's

568
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:53,340
on your your enterprise that's like the

569
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:57,899
first step just in everything this this

570
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:00,419
whatever it might be and to really get a

571
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,480
good picture of what's on your network

572
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,100
you need network security monitoring out

573
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,559
there and you know you might have to

574
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,659
have a pretty good deployment of

575
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,129
endpoint agents or you know montt

576
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,000
tracking your assets that way maybe

577
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,190
physically but you got the eye shadow IT

578
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,559
you if you have the centralized IT

579
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:24,179
you're you're bound to miss something

580
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,740
you got just things on your network that

581
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,440
you just won't know about if you just

582
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,540
rely on solely on one source so you need

583
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,250
to combine those sources together to

584
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:36,030
paint a picture of what's on your

585
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,130
network and you can't adequately you

586
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,340
know protect what's on your network

587
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:44,100
unless you know what's there it's it's

588
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:48,360
just or not only what's there but where

589
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:51,290
it as well a good example of where this

590
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,899
came in handy recently there's been two

591
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,600
new ddos amplification attacks that have

592
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,200
been discovered in the last year or so

593
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,360
one was mem cache several months ago and

594
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,250
then just in the last couple months was

595
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,709
WS discovery and so what we could do is

596
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,470
we just went to our log monitoring

597
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,190
solution and and plugged in the ports

598
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:19,620
and our address range and stuff and and

599
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,690
you know did a quick query and it

600
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,550
returned all the results of what has

601
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,840
those ports open to the internet that

602
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,169
are being taken advantage of and

603
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,080
participating in these DDoS attacks they

604
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:33,900
all happen to be IOT and there's we

605
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,730
can't put endpoint protection on those

606
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,400
IOT devices there would have been no way

607
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,010
we would have had no idea if we didn't

608
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,570
have network security monitoring that we

609
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,260
were participating in DDoS

610
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:49,409
acts against other organizations another

611
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,330
good reason is network security

612
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:56,670
monitoring is device and application

613
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:59,820
agnostic so it doesn't matter if it's a

614
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:02,700
login form on your SSO or login form on

615
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,210
a webcam your your network security

616
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,930
monitoring can the protections and the

617
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,850
logs that they generate are the same you

618
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,310
can normalize those events so if you

619
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:17,219
have an f5 and an engine ax and IA is

620
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,620
and Apache all in your network they're

621
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,120
all producing logs and different formats

622
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,620
or the fields are a little bit strange

623
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,750
or weird or something or it's in

624
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,179
structured your network security

625
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,060
monitoring you you deploy once and

626
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,280
doesn't matter what software is running

627
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,669
on the end of you know those endpoints

628
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,960
of stuff your data is going to come back

629
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:42,080
consistent everybody you know pretty

630
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,220
much every time and it really simplifies

631
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,990
you know instead of trying to pull from

632
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,570
20 different systems that your

633
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:51,000
organization's use is that you just kind

634
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,379
of need to rely on one and yeah you need

635
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,850
to do a little bit of fine tuning there

636
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,860
but for the most part again the

637
00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:00,120
protections and the login stuff is

638
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,550
consistent in the same and then shadow

639
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,500
IT you know your guests and stuff that's

640
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,600
pretty much the only way you have when

641
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,520
you don't have access to the endpoint

642
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,620
itself to do any type of protections

643
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:16,530
there what do you have left you have

644
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:18,149
network monitoring basically so then

645
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:23,639
reason number five auditing and

646
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:25,950
forensics you you know you might think

647
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,290
oh yeah we don't have any SMP open to

648
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,710
the Internet or yeah telnet is

649
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,420
completely off our network you know

650
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,190
maybe your tools are reporting that but

651
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,230
again you have a lot of IOT you don't

652
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,760
really know about that might be on your

653
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,140
network and your network security

654
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,870
monitoring is going to be the only thing

655
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,170
that can give you a clear big overview

656
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,120
picture of you know of that traffic

657
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:51,120
there so you can find misconfigurations

658
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,469
poor and poor performance you know again

659
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,209
when we come back to the DNS query

660
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,809
example if you have you know 10,000

661
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,950
requests every few seconds from a sir

662
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:02,309
you're not going to know that from your

663
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,750
end point solution you will find that

664
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:06,139
out for your network security monitoring

665
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,429
or you know DNS monitoring or something

666
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,900
you don't think you have s and be open

667
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,640
to the Internet I can't tell you how

668
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,020
many times I think I thought we didn't

669
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,659
have something open to the Internet and

670
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,900
then we find there's some convoluted way

671
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,220
either like a proxy or you know some

672
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,730
some hole that was punched to the

673
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,419
firewall that allowed it through and so

674
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,899
it goes you can confirm you know that

675
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,130
traffic yes you do or yes you don't have

676
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:39,149
that certain type of traffic on your

677
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:40,740
network and forensics is a great use

678
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:44,389
case for network security monitoring as

679
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,620
well you know if once the machine is

680
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,179
compromised the trust and the data

681
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,918
coming out of that machine drop

682
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,980
significantly

683
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,899
you know logs might be erased they might

684
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,590
have a zero-day exploit that they're

685
00:29:54,899 --> 00:30:01,309
doing to hide their tracks that your

686
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,010
your endpoints solution isn't watching

687
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:06,389
so it provides a second layer of

688
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,690
confirmation or trust of what's going on

689
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,980
and again if you're doing Incident

690
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,039
Response you'll want anything that you

691
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,390
can get it's completely independent and

692
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,350
that's why it makes it such a good

693
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:21,570
auditor or such a good tool is because

694
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,370
no matter how many you know workstations

695
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,850
are compromised your network data is not

696
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:30,719
really going to lie so some modern

697
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,010
network security strategies I mean I

698
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,250
mentioned this one before you got a

699
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,039
properly segment your network you really

700
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,980
need a to invest the time to you know

701
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,419
separate your sensitive areas from your

702
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,909
not so sensitive areas you know your

703
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,169
workstations from your servers they you

704
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,320
know there's just needs to be some

705
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:51,330
access controls and proper network

706
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,590
segmentation going on there and once

707
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,860
you're doing that then it makes

708
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,209
east-west monitoring a lot easier

709
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,219
because you know if they bypass their

710
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,140
firewall well now that if they wanted

711
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,130
their Traverse different segments

712
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,080
they're gonna have to keep basket

713
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,659
bypassing that and it makes you more

714
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,689
likely to be able to detect when there's

715
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:14,309
some type of security event going on

716
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,289
another strategy is to spam behind where

717
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:18,029
your ssl terminates so if you have a

718
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:20,789
load balancer or approximately where

719
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:23,220
your incoming web traffic terminates

720
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,529
well between that proxy and your your

721
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,049
your actual web servers the pool of

722
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:30,299
servers you can tap there or spam there

723
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:33,269
and you can still pull in a lot of the

724
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:36,240
application layer information and data

725
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:40,019
and still you know receive a lot of

726
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,929
those protections another more growing

727
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,240
in popularity is decryption it's still

728
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:49,100
it we'll talk a little bit about that in

729
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,889
a minute but it's it's very useful and

730
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:56,580
can be a little tricky to implement

731
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:59,820
another strategy is to centralize so on

732
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,039
the left here we have the picture of

733
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,879
Fort Knox you know I have the largest

734
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,980
repository of gold at one point you have

735
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:09,689
layers upon layers of security you have

736
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,179
you know very thick walls it looks like

737
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,370
guard towers fencing there's probably

738
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:18,509
like hidden bunkers or something in the

739
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:20,489
hair and then we have your local bank

740
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:23,039
branches you know there's about 800 or

741
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:26,909
maybe a thousand bank branches scattered

742
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,590
throughout Utah that doesn't look like

743
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:31,980
there's too many armed guards out there

744
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,559
or guard towers or something well we

745
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,250
know Fort Knox as far as we know was

746
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,928
never robbed it may be there it was and

747
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,759
it's been classified and sealed who

748
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:45,240
knows but for the most part it's not

749
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:50,940
like it happened every day in 2018 alone

750
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:54,840
there were 40 bank robberies in Utah it

751
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,210
it illustrates that when you can fortify

752
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,779
together when you can band together your

753
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:04,919
IT your resources or organization and we

754
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:08,190
have a consistent and fortified IT

755
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,230
infrastructure you're a lot less likely

756
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,909
to be compromised I mean oh eventually

757
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,039
you're always going to be compromised at

758
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,769
some point but it makes it a lot more

759
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,019
easier to detect or first to protect

760
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:19,619
identity to detect and respond and shut

761
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,779
it down

762
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:22,379
before you know any major damage is done

763
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,600
whereas

764
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:29,070
you know you if you have decentralized

765
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,780
IT or you're just not cooperating with

766
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,399
you know you have the little different

767
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,660
segments in your IT and stuff you're

768
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,760
bound to either miss breaches or if you

769
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,660
do find them it's it's not going to look

770
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,870
pretty good so if you can centralizing

771
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:48,450
consolidate standardize on security

772
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,699
Hardin images it makes things a lot

773
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,520
easier for both your sock and for your

774
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:58,679
IT teams so a little bit about

775
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:01,350
decryption so as much as we can get that

776
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,760
that data if that's not encrypted just

777
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,789
on the wire you know kind of what we

778
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,919
have talked about you really do good

779
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:10,500
network security monitoring you do need

780
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,679
that application layer you need that

781
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,480
visibility into there and really the

782
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,950
found the final way that you can get it

783
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,500
is through decryption there most the

784
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:24,480
time it's just limited to SSL or TLS so

785
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,810
you're not going to go to your your

786
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,159
vendors and say hey you know I want to

787
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:33,230
decrypt the SMB traffic on my network

788
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,550
that we do have encrypted if we do it

789
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:39,929
they just don't really it's not really a

790
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:42,179
big feature request and so most of their

791
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:45,960
attention is doing SSL and TLS

792
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:48,210
decryption so in the past

793
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,359
traditionally your certificates were

794
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,699
managed by your operating system several

795
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,918
years ago your browser started to have

796
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:59,700
their own certificate store and now we

797
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,740
see Apps as well they're doing doing

798
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,049
some type of certificate pinning or some

799
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,959
other these other protocols where if the

800
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,450
app excuse me doesn't recognize the

801
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,670
certificate that it's expecting from you

802
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,129
know the server then it's not going to

803
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,630
do it and you know it's not going to

804
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,940
complete the handshake and and some data

805
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,720
and so you're you're still you're

806
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,240
starting to get more of these

807
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,529
complexities here where one place will

808
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,089
support that decryption you know based

809
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,670
on those certificates and stuff whereas

810
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,320
other places in the apps won't see

811
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,170
there's going to be a lot of trial and

812
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,520
error it's not trivial you're gonna have

813
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,210
to kind of take this you know baby steps

814
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,309
out

815
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,599
if this is the strategy that you want to

816
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:44,640
take and before you really dive deep

817
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,940
into trying to do decryption you got to

818
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,930
figure out certificate management first

819
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,059
if you're doing inbound

820
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,250
inspection and you have you know a

821
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:55,440
hundred or a thousand certificates on a

822
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,930
thousand different servers it's gonna

823
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,630
make it really difficult if you at least

824
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,868
have some proxy points you can get a lot

825
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:06,869
more visibility a lot more mileage there

826
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:09,660
but if you really want broad decryption

827
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:10,619
and broad visibility you're going to

828
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,170
have to figure out that certificate

829
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,089
management piece you also gotta remember

830
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:18,030
that you're also reexpose inconsiderate

831
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:21,390
because now your login form to your your

832
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,829
caste login or SSO is encrypted but now

833
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,900
you're decrypting it so now those

834
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:26,940
passwords and the you know those

835
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,990
credentials are coming across and clear

836
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,930
text you got to you know see how you're

837
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,189
going to handle that and how are you

838
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,930
gonna handle it some of these sensitive

839
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,020
data and decide what you're not going to

840
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,598
decrypt as well and then once you have a

841
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,400
tool that does a lot of these tools now

842
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,170
support for wording on that decrypted

843
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,410
traffic for additional analysis whether

844
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,089
it's out of band or in band and you know

845
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,308
take advantage of that you know take

846
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:55,078
advantage of your layers security send

847
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:57,180
that to cryptid traffic further you know

848
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,940
if your firewall decrypts that send it

849
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,890
over to your IDs as well and so you can

850
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,380
get you know that bra visibility there

851
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,670
and finally just just don't expect a

852
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,720
hundred percent decryption there's some

853
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,210
things that you're just gonna have to

854
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,089
accept that you can't decrypt you know

855
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:17,849
let that phone app worry about their own

856
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:21,089
security basically write some additional

857
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,040
trends that we're seeing with network

858
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:26,640
security is there's a lot of offload

859
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,799
going on in two different ways one is

860
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,308
isolating things you just don't have any

861
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:34,349
control or visible very good visibility

862
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:37,460
into a great example or your guests

863
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:40,260
networks right you have guests coming on

864
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,030
they're just really you can't provide

865
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,680
they're all untrusted you can't really

866
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,990
provide good protections against

867
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,029
yourself against them so you know you

868
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,529
segment them off and kind of treat them

869
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,950
as their own little space

870
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:55,430
right ayat you know there's a lot of IOT

871
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:58,259
networks that companies have created

872
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,109
another big one is just moving to SAS

873
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,750
you know it's organizations like let's

874
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,910
not deal with the headache of you know

875
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,790
running this type of system PCI is a

876
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:11,310
good example there's products now where

877
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,170
where the company will sell these point

878
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,480
of sale devices that you plug into any

879
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,250
untrusted Network they take care of all

880
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,740
the PCI compliance within the device

881
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,940
itself that takes a whole burden off the

882
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:26,069
organization right and that's that's

883
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,720
just one way that you offload your risk

884
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:32,010
you know send it off to someone else to

885
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,689
worry about other trends is integrating

886
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,580
your network data with your other data

887
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,310
points you know we've been seeing that

888
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,080
with Sims for several years now you know

889
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,090
send centralized your logging send all

890
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,790
your logs to this one place and then you

891
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:48,900
know try and figure out alerts or you

892
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:51,810
know other queries to correlate that

893
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,100
data together more recently we've been

894
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,320
seeing vendors that are trying to

895
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,270
provide a suite of solutions from the

896
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,530
endpoint to the network to the cloud to

897
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:05,430
application security they they feel like

898
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:07,740
a unified approach is an integrated

899
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,440
approach is especially helpful in

900
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,060
defending against attacks but we have

901
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,250
also seen in the last couple of years

902
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,930
emergence of these big data security

903
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:20,190
analytic platforms whether it's user

904
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:23,040
behavior analytics or just type of

905
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,200
analytics on your security data again

906
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,570
these are just examples to give you kind

907
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,980
of a flavor here they're not anything I

908
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:33,090
mean you know I'm endorsing or anything

909
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:36,510
it's but Palo Alto score techs XDR

910
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:39,950
solution or Google's child company

911
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:42,390
Chronicle their back story platform

912
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:45,299
they've been putting a lot of effort and

913
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,080
and a pretty good solution there from

914
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,520
just the the propaganda that I read and

915
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,140
so you see this integration of your

916
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,860
network data with everything else so you

917
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,330
can paint a picture of what's going on

918
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,860
the other thing that we've seen is

919
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,720
moving from a kind of less high

920
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,700
confidence approach and I used to see a

921
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,209
log that said yep here's your usernames

922
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,160
and pass

923
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,130
flying off out your network excellent

924
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,440
rated now it's we see some you know

925
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:13,109
suspicious or abnormal activity going on

926
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,790
with this end point let's go check it

927
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:17,160
out a little bit more and figure out

928
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:21,140
what might be going on so we see that a

929
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:27,149
little bit of that that shift as well

930
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:29,129
and then I do want to end on this last

931
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:32,220
piece that as you know I am a network

932
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,960
security person but I also understand

933
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,580
and recognize that network security just

934
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,940
one piece to a holistic security program

935
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,670
excuse me

936
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,070
you need you know multiple sources you

937
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:47,400
know multiple areas that require cyber

938
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:50,280
security principles and visibility into

939
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,630
network security is just one I know we

940
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,420
know about endpoint security and cloud

941
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,859
security and others and when you can

942
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,050
combine them together that's what makes

943
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:01,470
them you know all the more powerful and

944
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,390
all the more effective so I you know I

945
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,709
encourage you you know keep in mind your

946
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,089
network security program but don't

947
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,080
forget everything else and don't think

948
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:13,349
it's standalone we gotta come together

949
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,710
so with that that's the end of what I

950
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:18,240
have prepared here I hope you guys can

951
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,000
take back this knowledge with you to

952
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,589
your organization's in and you know kind

953
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,599
of evaluate yeah if we are going to

954
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:26,099
continue our you know what we're gonna

955
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,660
do with network security monitoring and

956
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,730
hopefully can give you some points that

957
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,098
you can take back and and look at what

958
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,170
you can imply in your own network so but

959
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:41,450
that that's if you have any any

960
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:41,450
questions out there for me yeah go ahead

961
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,759
it so the question was what is my

962
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,820
experience with network security

963
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:56,230
monitoring in the in the cloud I have

964
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,670
very little we do have a couple my

965
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,050
co-workers do network security

966
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,910
monitoring up there and we've been

967
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:06,430
watching what the vendors are doing up

968
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:08,828
there Azure and Amazon are offering

969
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:12,009
they're pretty new for Amazon but

970
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:14,140
basically these these virtual taps in

971
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,150
your network so asher has had it for a

972
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,069
while where you can kind of tap that

973
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,349
network traffic amazon just recently

974
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,810
announced that i think earlier this year

975
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:25,000
the capability of doing that there's

976
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:29,500
still some questions there I mean if

977
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,040
you're using Amazon's SSL you know

978
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,720
private key store and stuff it's there's

979
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,869
not a clear way of how you can decrypt

980
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,098
your traffic coming in is it you know

981
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,020
there's still some unanswered questions

982
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,940
there so it's still being pioneered and

983
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,410
it's an area where the cloud providers

984
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:48,250
acknowledge that yeah it's still a

985
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:50,020
