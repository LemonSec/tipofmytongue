1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
okay it's too loud too too soft somebody

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,910
give me a thumbs up one way or another

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,510
cool

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,870
awesome well I appreciate everybody

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,460
coming today I get the honor of being

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,070
the last presentation before lunch so

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,650
you know thank you for those of you who

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,900
did show up my name is Clint Russell I'm

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,259
the Cisco Meraki product specialist

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,729
covering the Meraki product line within

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,320
Cisco and I'm here today to talk a

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,439
little bit about the evolution of video

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,149
surveillance and for those of you who

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,920
are on the sync on network today

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,690
hopefully the network is working well

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,100
that's all our stuff that we helped

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,589
donate for the show

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,500
switching wireless firewalls we also

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,940
have and full of cameras as well and

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,620
today we mostly talk about just kind of

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,809
the evolution of video surveillance and

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,089
then talk a little bit about how AI and

23
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,828
machine learning is kind of helping

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,070
modern-day professionals from a security

25
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,289
perspective I also do have three water

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,059
bottles up here these are out here for

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,250
purpose but for those of you who ask

28
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,809
questions and and stuff that it's

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,720
interesting towards the end of the

30
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:10,110
session those are for you guys so a

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:15,780
little incentive for anybody who is here

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,979
before lunch so just quick agenda I'll

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,380
talk first about kind of the evolution

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,750
of video surveillance what's what's kind

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,979
of happened over the last kind of 50

36
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,259
years since the market has really

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,479
matured and then talk a little bit about

38
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,130
kind of the next generation side I'll do

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,539
some demoing and then talk a little bit

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,860
about how cameras can be used as a

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,200
sensor of the real world it's not just

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,990
about collecting video anymore it's

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,009
really about sensing some things that

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,960
are happening and then being able to

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,170
respond to that sort of those sort of

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,059
events so first first off from an

47
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,649
analogue perspective this is kind of

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,610
where video surveillance got got its

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:57,180
early start in 1942 the first analog

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,360
CCTV camera was released and and kind of

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,189
started kind of building this world of

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,100
video surveillance and the architecture

53
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,750
overall generally you need a single DVR

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,720
they pull in data from these various

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,480
different cameras the video from the DVR

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,920
then feeds into a monitoring system and

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,269
then if you want any type of kind of

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,399
about viewing capabilities you have to

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,130
have some sort of router firewall to

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,380
basically pull in VPN information to

61
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,519
essentially act like your on network to

62
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,980
view the various video feeds and from a

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
kind of intelligence perspective which

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,280
is a lot about what this presentation

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,100
would be more about all the intelligence

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,150
from an analog camera perspective

67
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,410
basically lived in the control room in

68
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,600
the Security Operations Center where

69
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,970
people are basically pulling in the

70
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,890
video data viewing it on walls from a

71
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,080
monitoring perspective trying to see

72
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,569
what's happening make sense of events

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,980
and and leveraging the you know people

74
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,079
there that are literally actually

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,420
sitting there watching video raw video

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,220
and then if an event actually occurred

77
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,559
then they have to kind of sift back and

78
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,180
pull that and and it worked great for a

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,660
little while but big problem with the

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,080
analog obviously the resolution was

81
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,340
pretty poor back in those days you

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
constantly need people to basically be

83
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,880
continuously interacting and there's no

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,330
concept of artificial intelligence it's

85
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:20,640
purely just the control room where it

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:22,980
all lived so in the 90s the first IP

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,649
camera was released and this was this

88
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,328
kind of brought about what's what today

89
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,920
the modern video surveillance based

90
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,019
architecture looks like and essentially

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,018
what you have is it's a very similar

92
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,459
architecture overall instead of the DVR

93
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,350
you just have Envy ours now they're

94
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,750
Network video recorders the IP cameras

95
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,820
plug into switches and you generally

96
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,329
have an N VR or multiple NPR's per local

97
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,100
per location but it requires a lot of

98
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,140
on-premise Hardware right if you've got

99
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,790
hundreds of or thousands of locations

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,250
you really need an end yard every single

101
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,980
location to address the video data and

102
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,190
then that video data is then sent back

103
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,530
to Jayant storage arrays to store for as

104
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,829
much long as long as you need it and you

105
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,420
also have all sorts of kind of software

106
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,470
packages custom software packages if you

107
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,390
want to actually view the video

108
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,910
typically you've got to download plugins

109
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,540
and that sort of thing unless you're on

110
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,918
the on the network and maybe the last

111
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,899
thing here I think is really interesting

112
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,668
especially it's this conference you know

113
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,609
the NBR is the number one network

114
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,979
vulnerability today they generally get

115
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,420
installed and never patched I had a

116
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,400
customer the other day who was talking

117
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,370
talking about how they had a NVR that

118
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,210
was running Windows 98 still

119
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,010
mind-blowing to me

120
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,810
so just overall pretty interesting sort

121
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,130
of thing and generally like it's just a

122
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,150
lot of hardware a lot of custom software

123
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,980
makes it really difficult to to view so

124
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,549
with modern CCTV systems this is a

125
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,190
screenshot of a milestone whoo many guys

126
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,130
probably may be familiar with you know

127
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,630
there's lots of things that you can do

128
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,250
they they do a really good job of kind

129
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,050
of allocating what you know where

130
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,410
cameras are on the map they provide you

131
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,650
know multi multi stream views there's a

132
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,030
lot of you know pretty easy ways to kind

133
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,310
of communicate and interact with this

134
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,989
system but at the end of the day if you

135
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,840
want to do any type of intelligence on

136
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,640
the video you really have to stand up a

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,799
server array and a data center to

138
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,060
actually analyze the video after it's

139
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,760
pumped back into something and then

140
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,310
basically run software custom software

141
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,409
on that server array to actually analyze

142
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,910
the video in general and that could be

143
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,280
used for all sorts of different things

144
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,510
it could be you know people detection

145
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,400
and object detection and facial

146
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,140
recognition those types of things

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,729
you can all you can do all those today

148
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,760
but it all requires this kind of

149
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,250
on-premise data center today and this

150
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,099
architecture has really been unchanged

151
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,260
largely since the late 90s when the IP

152
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,420
camera was first invented and if you

153
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,240
think about this like what's happened

154
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,480
since the IP camera was released in the

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,610
late 90s well in my mind a lot and

156
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,260
specifically a lot with related to both

157
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,480
mobile computing as well as cloud

158
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,570
computing right so you know in the late

159
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,300
90s Google was founded in October 1999

160
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,500
we had the first GPU released to the

161
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,720
market

162
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,330
in the early 2000s Android was release

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,960
YouTube was founded we had AWS come out

164
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,570
the first kind of cloud services company

165
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,789
Asher was released and then kind of in

166
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,830
the mid to late 2000s we started seeing

167
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,810
like a lot of processing power start to

168
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,960
hit mobile markets right so the first

169
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,420
iPhone was released in 2007 with a

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,650
whopping 128 Meg's of RAM and a 412

171
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:40,110
megahertz processor but in 2014 in

172
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,099
basically less than 10 years right we

173
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,340
went from

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,520
128 Meg's of RAM to up to 8 gigs of RAM

175
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,810
and an octa-core processor inside of a

176
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,510
cell phone right which is which is

177
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,330
pretty outstanding and what's

178
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,039
interesting is that while this all these

179
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,289
kind of advancements have happened with

180
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,510
both mobile and and and cloud computing

181
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,470
a lot of this hasn't kind of hid the

182
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,610
CCTV market yet so the idea is you know

183
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,890
what if we could use the advances in

184
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,770
mobile and cloud computing and apply

185
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,960
those types of lessons to the CCTV and

186
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,609
video surveillance world from that

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,900
perspective get entirely different

188
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,370
architecture be a lot different than

189
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,840
this kind of data center world that we

190
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,130
live in today so I work from Rocky and

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,659
we're not the only ones looking at this

192
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,590
problem in this way but there is there

193
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,600
is something be said about this

194
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,270
architecture and essentially what

195
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,340
happens is rather than pumping all the

196
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,260
video back to a storage ray we will

197
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,659
completely eliminate the NVR and DVR

198
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,150
entirely we store everything on disk

199
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,060
directly on the cameras and our cameras

200
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,770
also have the ability to to kind of be

201
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,930
viewed remotely from the cloud from any

202
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,820
type of device we use standard web-based

203
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,860
video there's no plugins to install no

204
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,010
custom software packages nothing like

205
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,320
that and then beyond that because the

206
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,210
cameras themselves have this octa-core

207
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,849
processor similar to what's built into

208
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,190
the iPhone X or the Samsung Galaxy S 10

209
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,030
they can use that opticore processor to

210
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,860
not only view the video but actually do

211
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,530
AI and machine learning at the edge and

212
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,410
in addition once they actually process

213
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,239
or identify something that's occurring

214
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,520
on a scene they can also integrate with

215
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,230
third-party applications to do further

216
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,000
image processing things like Amazon

217
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,830
recognition Google Vision and some of

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,020
those other engines that have really

219
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,760
powerful AI image processing engines

220
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,620
without having to pump it back to a data

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,210
center and write your own kind of use

222
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,350
cases so that's where that's where

223
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,890
things are kind of going that's the

224
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,570
architecture here I'm gonna do a quick

225
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,309
demo just to show you what this looks

226
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,020
like and then want to talk a little bit

227
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,400
about how the cameras can be used as a

228
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,730
sensor with some of those third-party

229
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:52,130
integrations as well so just a second

230
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,130
here all right

231
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,469
there we go all right sorry I should be

232
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,029
mirroring my displays cuz it'd be a lot

233
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:16,350
easier for me to then trying to do it

234
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:19,100
backwards hold on just a sec all right

235
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:22,440
there we go much better trying to do a

236
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,110
reverse is pretty pretty difficult okay

237
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,779
so so for those who didn't don't know as

238
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,130
I mentioned Meraki is powering all of

239
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,040
st. comm from a networking and also

240
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,390
camera perspective and Tristan and the

241
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,610
folks here were kind enough to give me

242
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,680
just read only access to the cameras as

243
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,089
a part of my speech today so hopefully

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,349
the Wi-Fi is working well for you guys

245
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,410
hopefully it's pretty fast we've got

246
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,120
Wi-Fi six ApS powering this thing but

247
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,069
you know Meraki in general we make you

248
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,050
know routers switches access points and

249
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,270
cameras this for those who haven't seen

250
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,770
this this is the Meraki dashboard I only

251
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,089
have read-only access to the cameras so

252
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,939
there's a total of ten cameras that are

253
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,650
powering saint khan right now I'm kind

254
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,390
of monitoring this the the various

255
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,120
spectrum here I'm gonna go directly into

256
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,520
the video wall and by the way I'm over

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,450
Wi-Fi right now so if there's a little

258
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,310
bit of jitter here or latency don't read

259
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,110
it too much this is probably a 30 Meg

260
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,930
plus stream that's going directly to my

261
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,089
laptop at the moment this is a live view

262
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,349
until the various cameras from here on

263
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,540
the video walls we can click on one of

264
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,250
these cameras and let's say we had an

265
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,560
event that happened you know maybe

266
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,350
somebody was was lost their laptop and

267
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,359
somebody was taken and we know about the

268
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,700
time when it occurred we don't know

269
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,230
exactly when it happened or or where it

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,570
was from so what we're gonna do is is

271
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,350
just use plain language here and type

272
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:42,329
say 3:00 p.m. yesterday and by the way

273
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,880
like even with my typos it should be

274
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:48,660
able to kind of pick up that time this

275
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,700
good directly goes into the the cameras

276
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,800
view from 3:00 p.m. yesterday and we're

277
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,180
going to search for some motion that

278
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,959
occurred like right here in this little

279
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,000
area of the of the laptop here so we're

280
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,529
gonna say hey we saw some motion there

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,060
there were someone's laptop maybe they

282
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,589
something occurred during that

283
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,300
particular time

284
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,009
so I'm gonna click on one of these

285
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,139
images and what you're seeing here

286
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,759
there's a ton of obviously things going

287
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,439
on here but this is doing something

288
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,480
called motion recap and what motion

289
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,459
recap is is doing is it's trying to

290
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,620
categorize events and show you all of

291
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,719
the motion that occurred for a

292
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,149
particular event on a single jpg image

293
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,339
right so the camera in this case it was

294
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,930
a thirty point one second event that was

295
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,269
detected that had some emotion in that

296
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,430
area where we were searching and you're

297
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,709
seeing like ghosted images of every

298
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,180
single person that was walking during

299
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,219
that 30 second image on a single event

300
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,949
the idea for our security professionals

301
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,689
is hey I want to quickly and easily find

302
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,339
the event that I care about because

303
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:46,230
maybe I knew that someone in a in a

304
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,519
green shirt walked by this laptop at a

305
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,860
particular time the next thing we knew

306
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,720
it was gone right so we'll go ahead and

307
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,899
play the video here and this will go it

308
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,220
go ahead and actually do the video clip

309
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,199
that we just looked at keep in mind

310
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,730
30-second events reporting a little bit

311
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,740
of emotion before you see this

312
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,329
individual kind of walk through and

313
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,730
ultimately you know someone kind of

314
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,859
makes some sort of motion that passes

315
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,199
through our our area here so right so

316
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,879
you go to the clip you skip that some

317
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:14,819
time before and some time after of the

318
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,139
area that you're searching for and by

319
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,120
the way if I want to share this or

320
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:21,930
screenshot this or zoom in zoom out

321
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,339
full-screen all that is is supported as

322
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,888
well and keep in mind we did this

323
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,449
directly from the video wall so you

324
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:31,610
could even do the motion shirks at this

325
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,609
level as well which is pretty powerful

326
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:41,759
cool let's go back to slides here so

327
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,350
that was just kind of a quick demo of

328
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,970
just like the showing that use the

329
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,410
architecture trying to find the events

330
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,959
and stuff this is this is something that

331
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,149
like today most facilities and security

332
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,768
professionals like trying to find the

333
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,920
event that they care about is incredibly

334
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,970
difficult and being able to do that in

335
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,979
just a handful of minutes with some

336
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,759
plain language a quick search and and

337
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,959
all that is is pretty unique to Meraki

338
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,699
but beyond that what I think is pretty

339
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,290
interesting is these cameras also have

340
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:08,729
the ability to be leveraged as a sensor

341
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,449
and so I'm going to demo some of this as

342
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,370
well

343
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,829
in a second but one of the one of the

344
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,569
examples is our cameras again they have

345
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:17,890
this optical processor at the edge this

346
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,630
ability to do object detection

347
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,430
and the first iterations of this include

348
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,439
both vehicle and person detection so

349
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,089
you're seeing in this screenshot we're

350
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,230
analyzing images and identifying that

351
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,820
there is a vehicle here and also

352
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,829
identifying that there's a person over

353
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,990
here and this is fully uh naanum eyes

354
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,000
dand maintains privacy it doesn't use

355
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,250
any PII or anything it's just our whole

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,579
built edge ai algorithm running at the

357
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,470
edge on the cameras itself but beyond

358
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,910
just the baseline kind of object

359
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,740
detection and stuff that's built into

360
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,740
the cameras there's also the ability to

361
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,019
actually leverage machine learning to

362
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,640
take some of that data and send it in to

363
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,510
various third-party applications and

364
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,329
there there are a few different ways

365
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,060
that this can be done if you want to get

366
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:00,040
a historical aggregate you can do a

367
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,479
query using the API the empty sense API

368
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,910
to say how many people were here for

369
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,620
example at a particular time or a

370
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,140
current snapshot how many are here now

371
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,930
or you can subscribe to a real-time feed

372
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,420
to actually have real-time integrations

373
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,279
as to you know when some something is

374
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,930
detected either an object or a person or

375
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,660
other types of things in the future I

376
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,250
want something to happen right so this

377
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,990
is this all built around what we call

378
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,070
the MV sense API and there's there's a

379
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,890
number of other ways that this can be

380
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,029
done with other manufacturers as well

381
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,670
just to illustrate this this particular

382
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,769
example this is something that's running

383
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,719
at Safeway stores today it's in pilot at

384
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,459
a handful of them and what they do is

385
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,949
they have a number of cameras throughout

386
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:42,640
the throughout their store and they

387
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:44,439
built a an app for the store managers

388
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,390
themselves and so essentially what's

389
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,130
happening is the app is pulling in data

390
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,339
from all the various cameras that are

391
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,990
deployed in a store and identifying when

392
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,269
there's when it's busy and when there's

393
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,800
lines right so in this case like you see

394
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,209
there's a big queue of people that are

395
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,490
kind of waiting to get their groceries

396
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,619
checked out on here on the right in the

397
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,480
middle they basically say hey I'm

398
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,949
detecting at least a hundred people in

399
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,190
the store right now by the way this is

400
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:10,630
increasing an average of 5% per hour

401
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,790
maybe this might be for a few minutes I

402
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,380
can't can't remember and so the store

403
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,149
manager with his iPhone actually gets a

404
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,589
notification saying hey time to add

405
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,899
cashiers there are more than a hundred

406
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,370
visitors in the store right now we need

407
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:25,649
to kind of adjust how people are being

408
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,970
deployed so just just one example there

409
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,690
another couple of these things and again

410
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,180
I'll show a little demo of our most

411
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,610
detection algorithm as well if somebody

412
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,670
is detected or if a vehicle is detected

413
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,380
we have the ability to basically send

414
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,630
that image problem after our edge

415
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,630
processing is done to third-party based

416
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,270
computer vision services right so on the

417
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,980
on the left this is using Amazon Web

418
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,100
Services recognition software which is a

419
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,830
really powerful image recognition that

420
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,690
basically says hey on this image I've

421
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,150
detected a snapshot from the camera

422
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,530
we've on-demand said hey I want to send

423
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,199
the snapshot and then do further image

424
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,550
processing on this and what recognition

425
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,560
is done is it says hey I've detected

426
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,199
glasses with ninety nine point two three

427
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,459
percent conference confidence I've got

428
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,530
an accessory of ninety nine percent

429
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,940
confidence I'm ninety eight point three

430
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,310
one percent sure that there's a person

431
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,220
in this image and by the way it's a

432
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,739
human and this person is a male

433
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,990
somewhere between 35 and 52 with a happy

434
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,870
emotional state right so this is this is

435
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,730
something that is is the camera detects

436
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,220
something it immediately sends that

437
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,720
image back to AWS for sub-second

438
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,610
processing you can get this image back

439
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,170
in real time right so this is this is

440
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,880
what how he you know ultimately save

441
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,800
lives at schools right it's this can be

442
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,980
used for weapon detection today right

443
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,479
now on the left or on the right over

444
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,730
here this is a different image

445
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,700
processing algorithm open ALPR another

446
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:54,410
very cool open-source tool for image

447
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,090
processing our camera has detected a

448
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,890
vehicle it sends the snapshot to do

449
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,420
further processing on the open source

450
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,790
platform and it says hey I picked up

451
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,250
this license plate here's the color of

452
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,649
the vehicle the make of the vehicle the

453
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,240
year and then also it's it's

454
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,120
understanding that we're in a cul-de-sac

455
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,359
and in a driveway here right so this is

456
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,979
this is really cool can be done today

457
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,948
and and we're not the only ones doing

458
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,319
this either last thing I'll show a quick

459
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:27,170
demo of so that you guys can see this as

460
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:31,460
well looks like again I got kind of I

461
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,460
need to exit out of this abet

462
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:43,800
there we go oh that's a good question

463
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:47,100
it varies greatly based on the kind of

464
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,700
algorithm that you use right I would say

465
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,500
Amazon's

466
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,500
recognition is probably the most

467
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,330
accurate right now but in general the

468
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,680
more video and more images you feed it

469
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,750
the more accurate you're gonna get right

470
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,310
so the idea is like that's just

471
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,260
processing on a single image if you're

472
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,840
continuously sending snapshots every 10

473
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,640
seconds 30 seconds a minute right it can

474
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,379
do further kind of processing and

475
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,720
provide better value because it truly

476
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,190
does facial recognition as well so it

477
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,860
can differentiate between individuals

478
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,830
but we do at the edge on the on the on

479
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,969
the camera is relatively rudimentary by

480
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,550
comparison right because we're just

481
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,080
doing an image based processing to

482
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,940
understand what's a vehicle what's a

483
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,379
person right and we rely on the

484
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,500
third-party engines to do kind of the

485
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,580
further image processing there but

486
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
you'll see again it's still in our

487
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,419
infancy so you'll see it evolve good

488
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,690
question by the way I owe you a bottle

489
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:41,250
one in the back sure again depends

490
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,440
greatly on the on the algorithm that

491
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,910
you're using right so Google Vision is

492
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,150
able to detect guns and knives

493
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,350
specifically EWS recognition has a

494
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,760
little bit further things they even

495
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,939
describe describe things like blunt

496
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,010
object possible you know possible weapon

497
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,960
not sure and the nice thing is you get

498
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,660
that confidence level when you based on

499
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,400
the processing for any of the images

500
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,830
that are detected that they can actually

501
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,900
kind of you know integrate into your

502
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,010
algorithm and also provide that value to

503
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:18,030
the rest of your facility's security

504
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:19,620
personnel mm-hmm sure I'm not sure to be

505
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,170
honest with you I haven't played much

506
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,419
with the third-party stuff on the

507
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,420
vehicle side yet yeah

508
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,730
yep

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,140
so so one of the things that I've seen

510
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,460
with the school districts a lot of them

511
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,990
that have looked at kind of the audio

512
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,640
sensors they already have something in

513
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,720
place for that right so what they really

514
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,520
want to do is say hey if my other system

515
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,360
that I have that's already doing audio

516
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
and it's whether they're using

517
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,800
ultrasonic or a number of other types of

518
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,080
sensors to detect that can I get

519
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,820
something from that to also tie into

520
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,070
here and the way that the way that

521
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,960
they're doing it this particular school

522
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,399
district in general is they have

523
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,100
basically two different systems and

524
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,990
they're ingesting API data from both so

525
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,280
from our cameras like they have they

526
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,140
haven't what they call an anomaly

527
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,060
detection if one camera detects more

528
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,560
than 50 people in a particular area at

529
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,720
one particular time they think it's a

530
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,770
fight very likely some sort of thing

531
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,630
where they at least need you to play

532
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,190
somebody so they take that information

533
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,800
they also take those and they correlate

534
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,390
the two together yeah we do have

535
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,240
baseline audio detection but nothing

536
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:43,090
with for anomalies yet on the audio yeah

537
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:46,080
I apologize I can't hear you I'm I'm

538
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,080
trying I'm

539
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,370
again it's going to depend on what

540
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,928
algorithm you're using these are all

541
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,989
very fair questions I'm not a Google

542
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,030
vision or AWS recognition like expert

543
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,679
it's only stuff that I played with them

544
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,950
myself but I would say it's in general

545
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,880
the algorithms are the AWS recognitions

546
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,700
have been around for about three and a

547
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,740
half years it's getting continuously

548
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,500
better you know in the early days it bid

549
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,500
baseline age detection gender that's

550
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,570
about it now you're like far far far

551
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,179
beyond it with with object detection and

552
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,149
stuff and ultimately I think it depends

553
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,950
a little bit on how much you're willing

554
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,470
to spend with their compute right

555
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,120
because ultimately they you know these

556
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,309
are their compute cycles that are doing

557
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,040
the image recognition stuff and and all

558
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,690
that so fair questions I don't know the

559
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:53,090
answer

560
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:56,809
yeah mhm absolutely so zooming in is all

561
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,889
still built in the this mv-22 s like

562
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,960
that are all deployed around the

563
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,179
conference these are you support full

564
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,059
varifocal lenses I'm all the video that

565
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:08,030
we're doing is 1080p so you're you know

566
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,129
but you've got 12 X varifocal zoom on

567
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:14,559
top of that can't based on the dome so

568
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:23,120
it's it's pretty high quality video yeah

569
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:25,340
back well high res camera work better

570
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,049
with Google vision I would say in

571
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,879
general yes right like the better

572
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,620
resolution camera you have the better

573
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,660
image that it's going to you're going to

574
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,580
send when something is detected to the

575
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,370
to the cloud platform which is gonna in

576
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,260
in turn result in better you know

577
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,379
confidence from a object detection

578
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,429
perspective there absolutely

579
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,750
right here sorry I'm gonna go back and

580
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,650
forth to the front back because we've

581
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,419
got a lot of people yep the fastest

582
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,740
object you can detect so it depends a

583
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:55,160
little bit on the frame rate honey how

584
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,380
you select the camera so our our heart

585
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,450
high quality bit bitrate streams are

586
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,919
just 30 frames per second so we're not

587
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,080
gonna detect something that's you know

588
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,320
going altra sonic or subsonic or

589
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,770
anything with that but but the but the

590
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
bay

591
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,730
image processing that's done at the edge

592
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,950
will detect something every within every

593
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,330
second for sure so at 30 frames per

594
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,130
second you're gonna do you're gonna do

595
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,678
pretty good but we're not going to

596
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,679
detect bullets right back

597
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,639
sure so this this whole st. Khan Network

598
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,770
including the cameras is all standalone

599
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,120
for this particular thing so Meraki

600
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,420
cameras only work with the Meraki

601
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,189
dashboard it's not a it's not something

602
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,830
that you know we have we kind of have a

603
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,540
closed loop system in place where we

604
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,879
typically see a lot of like our

605
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,580
customers doing is trying this out at a

606
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,740
particular area or in a building right

607
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,780
first because they've made a significant

608
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:56,809
investment in one system or another yeah

609
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:59,360
in that yellow sari at just the image

610
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:01,460
right so this so in the mv-22 example

611
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,469
it's a varifocal lens so we are

612
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,000
literally zooming here the cameras

613
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,860
themselves we do not support any pan

614
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,500
tilt zoom cameras we have 360 cameras

615
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,750
that support digital PTC's right but

616
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,670
this this is not I'm not actually moving

617
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,540
the lens to focus on this it's still

618
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,300
looking at the full image

619
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:22,490
I'm simply as an operator being able to

620
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:24,740
zoom in zoom out etc awesome great

621
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,530
questions guys I've got only have three

622
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,750
water bottles but those are really good

623
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,309
questions stop by the Cisco booth

624
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,450
afterwards and I'll see if I can get you

625
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,690
some other stuff for those I don't have

626
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,960
bottles for all right how am i doing on

627
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,090
time

628
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,850
sweet five minutes beautiful okay so let

629
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,980
me go back to the cameras here and I

630
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,980
want to pick on one of these cameras

631
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,630
let's pick this one in the north so I

632
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,660
talked a little bit about the person

633
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,790
detection stuff and so this is this is

634
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,400
one of the cameras that's it's mounted

635
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,139
here and we're just analyzing the total

636
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,370
number of people that have been detected

637
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,440
and by the way well we'll build these

638
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,030
things called motion heat maps to kind

639
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,820
of display where we've seen motion this

640
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,300
is just looking at today let me go back

641
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,879
to yesterday so we can analyze the foot

642
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,460
traffic prop like over time at the

643
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,080
conference so this particular camera by

644
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,630
the way this is the type of data that's

645
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,159
like accessible via API in real time

646
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,670
from the cameras that's being used by

647
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,690
Safeway for example in their app but but

648
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,080
you'll notice you know we don't see any

649
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,750
motion roughly until roughly 5 or 6 a.m.

650
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,419
between 5 and 6 a.m. we saw 5 people

651
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,190
than 61 at the 6 o'clock hour to 7

652
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,020
o'clock our 589 though in the conference

653
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,570
of course the doors open we saw a ton

654
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,310
and these numbers aren't the number of

655
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,899
people because keep in mind that these

656
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,639
are doing people detection but it's all

657
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,680
totally anonymized this is a number of

658
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,600
entrances and exits that this camera saw

659
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,120
right so obviously there's not you know

660
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,800
30,000 plus people here but this camera

661
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,010
is seeing you know thirty thousand

662
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,330
entrances and exits into its frame of

663
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,379
view over the course this time and keep

664
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,840
in mind this is one of those cameras

665
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,490
it's like viewing like a large portion

666
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,899
of the conference here I can't remember

667
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,640
which one this is this is cam 3 in the

668
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,430
north so this is in the in the you know

669
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,930
exhibition hall and stuff but the cool

670
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,160
thing is like if you were monitoring an

671
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,660
area that doesn't see a lot of motion

672
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,850
and you want to beat it you want to like

673
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,900
know when stuff is detected or people

674
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,429
are detected during those times

675
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,290
obviously you can set that up

676
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,820
you can also set like zones of interest

677
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,320
to automatically alert things and also

678
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,629
trigger that API to to you know to do

679
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,530
further image recognition with something

680
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:37,100
like AWS recognition or Google vision

681
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:39,410
awesome and by the way you know the cool

682
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,330
thing that isn't necessarily just by the

683
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:43,670
estimated peacock you have 44 people

684
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,850
this camera saw at one time but a total

685
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,000
of 400 6000 people did entrances and

686
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,639
exits detected yesterday by this one

687
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,130
camera in this data of course you know

688
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,430
is interesting but as as a raw feed but

689
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,810
the where you're doing it the API kind

690
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,810
of for the recognition on this is cooler

691
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,810
yeah

692
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,899
so keep in mind you can do a snapshot of

693
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,279
anything at at one time like how many

694
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:19,799
people are here right now you can do

695
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,360
that at any time it'll do that and it

696
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,399
will analyze it across all your cameras

697
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,750
that you have in that store to do an

698
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,459
aggregate count yes absolutely

699
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,669
they certainly could there are ways that

700
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,620
they could kind of take that data and

701
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,480
parse that out if they really wanted to

702
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,289
but generally the trending information

703
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,549
is more important than anything else it

704
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,289
depending on how they have the cameras

705
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:47,220
like oriented to right like they could

706
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:48,960
in theory you know just be deployed just

707
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,390
at entry at the entrances for example

708
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,029
and they get a pretty good count of

709
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:55,260
actually what's at the store yeah you

710
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:57,149
can absolutely be double counting they

711
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,610
definitely could be and certainly we are

712
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:01,620
right in this case but again this is

713
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,719
just raw data it can be parsed in and

714
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,239
taken in a lot of ways and access via

715
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,039
API all right well I appreciate

716
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,990
everybody if anyone has any more further

717
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,908
questions I'll be here all day at the

718
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,549
