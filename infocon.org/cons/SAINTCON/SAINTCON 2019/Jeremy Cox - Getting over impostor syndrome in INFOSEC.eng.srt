everybody hold on just second Hanna she

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,220
is a rock star everybody needs to give

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,080
her a big round of applause

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,420
[Applause]

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,760
we appreciate ID I don't know how many

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,190
of you guys are in state government k-12

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,010
or whatever but we appreciate Hannah so

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,370
much for all that she does for us so

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,379
thank you I appreciate you wonderful

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,390
well my name is Jeremy Cox I'm super

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,879
tech guy we're gonna talk about getting

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,910
over impostor syndrome in InfoSec which

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,468
is a really challenging thing especially

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,449
when you come to a conference like this

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,469
and you walk in the door and you go I am

19
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,019
overwhelmed and in and the thing that we

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,240
I want you to know is this is normal

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,720
this is very normal and we're gonna talk

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,289
about what this means how it impacts all

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,880
of us and it's not just it's not just if

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,460
you feel like you're alone in you're not

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,449
okay and so that's the biggest piece I

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,030
want you two to know here but so

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,700
imposter syndrome it's that moment when

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,060
you're most vulnerable and all your

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,340
doubts come crashing in around you this

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,759
is when you worry that the world is

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,670
gonna say you're a fraud okay and many

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,159
of us have felt that way before and many

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,880
of us continue to feel that way all the

34
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,770
time so impostor syndrome is like this

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,520
we think of ourselves in this little

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,960
bubble of what I know and we think of

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,899
other people and we see these other

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,929
people and what they know what we think

39
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,850
they know but in reality what it really

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,649
looks like it's more like what you see

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,539
on the right-hand side because most of

42
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:10,250
the time there's lots of overlap that

43
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,800
happens in the IT second the information

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,190
security community and there is no

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,310
buddy that knows everything I wish there

46
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,620
was because then we could ask them all

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,750
the questions right but there is nobody

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,690
that does and everybody has overlapping

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,580
experience and knowledge and we're all

50
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:35,250
in that process of growth so it's easy

51
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,950
to fall into that trap that says I think

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,780
that everybody else know so much more

53
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,280
than me okay so don't do that

54
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,290
so for Nina some people who believe that

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,840
there are not intelligent capable or

56
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,679
creative despite evidence of high

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,290
achievement

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,290
that's what impostor syndrome is is

59
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,829
oftentimes we'll have great things we'll

60
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,959
be doing great things but we're not

61
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,090
recognizing those great things this is

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,740
very normal for people to feel this way

63
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,900
in fact in IT especially it's normal and

64
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,210
let me tell you why because it's very

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,500
very technical and a lot of times we'll

66
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,780
sit down on a computer we'll do

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,239
something and everybody else says well

68
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,280
man he just made that look easy I mean

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,220
how many of you have had people say you

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,480
just you make it look easy okay all of

71
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,060
you can raise your hands at this point

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,470
you've all been there

73
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,709
but somewhere between making it look

74
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,989
easy we discount the value of that and

75
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,800
that intersection is when that impostor

76
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:41,130
syndrome starts to creep in okay so how

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,350
widespread is it so BYU did a study and

78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,030
they revealed that 20% of college

79
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,940
students and there's and their sample

80
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,940
suffered from very strong feelings of

81
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,320
imposter ISM now these were students in

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:58,380
technical or very complex fields and a

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,230
blind report discovered that 58% of tech

84
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,230
employees 58 percent that's that's a

85
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,660
huge chunk suffer from imposter syndrome

86
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,840
and then there's another study that says

87
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,160
up to 70 people will experience it at

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,540
some point so the challenge with InfoSec

89
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,760
in technology is when we get into it it

90
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,350
there's just this constant change and so

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,599
it starts out with where that little

92
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,120
yellow dot in the corner we know that

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,460
much and we start to come to these calm

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
Frances and we see this big blue mass

95
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,560
and every time we look at that mass

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,990
increases in size and it gets bigger and

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
bigger and bigger and we get to the

98
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,870
point where we go how can I keep up with

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
this

100
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,180
have you ever felt that way I can't keep

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,449
up with this okay I feel that way every

102
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,650
day all right every day because it is

103
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:55,139
constantly changing the reality is all

104
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,750
the things that are changing all those

105
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,120
red dots are other people and they're

106
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,680
constantly pioneering new fields and new

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,720
things and new concepts in security and

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,139
we need to realize that we can't know

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,080
everything in that big blue blob it's

110
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,289
okay for us to know that part that we're

111
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,909
really good at and to focus on that but

112
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,770
it's also okay to know that we can

113
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,160
continue to expand our knowledge and

114
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:26,099
everybody is in that process so this is

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,310
normal all right this is very normal so

116
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,260
how do we overcome it first the first

117
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,870
thing you need to do is be aware of how

118
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,849
you think so you can change the way you

119
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,010
think if you start to feel this way if

120
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,620
you start to feel like hey I'm just not

121
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,169
cutting it I can't do this you need to

122
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,700
change the way you think all right so

123
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,440
the reason we need to pay attention to

124
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,219
the conversation going on our heads is

125
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,430
so that we can reframe it in the way a

126
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,440
non imposter would reframe it so we

127
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,080
think think positive we spin it on the

128
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,410
positive side and look at the positive

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,219
thoughts okay so we don't have to know

130
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,020
everything and we're used to being in

131
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,660
that world where we feel like we have to

132
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,880
but we don't have to in fact sometimes

133
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,310
the best answer we can give an

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,260
administrator or someone or in a manager

135
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,320
when they come to us and they ask us a

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,680
question is I don't know the answer that

137
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,380
but I'll find out because we're IT

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,870
people we can find out the answers and

139
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,580
we know we can find out the answers and

140
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,280
we can figure it out and we can grow

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,229
into that so turn it positive and change

142
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,659
your thoughts where they were negative

143
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,360
into a positive action so what does this

144
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,650
mean so you may be wandering around st.

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,449
kannan thinking you're in a

146
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,008
see of knowledge and you may feel

147
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,050
overwhelmed by it

148
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,330
the imposter would say this is way over

149
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,500
my head okay

150
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,340
the non impostor would say what a great

151
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,120
opportunity to learn some cool new stuff

152
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,400
now that doesn't mean you might

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,380
understand it like an expert does in the

154
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,060
next two days because you've got to

155
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,360
realize that the experts who are talking

156
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,090
about it have taken months and months

157
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,370
and years to understand what they

158
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,340
understand about it and you've got two

159
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,620
days right but it's an opportunity for

160
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,690
you to get into it a little bit and get

161
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,850
started and if you decide hey I want to

162
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,770
learn more about it now you've got those

163
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:27,330
months and months and years and years to

164
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,698
study and figure it out okay so think

165
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,620
about it in a positive way it's an

166
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,380
opportunity to learn an opportunity to

167
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,389
grow so change the way you think so this

168
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,750
is a great quote from CS Lewis a lot of

169
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,759
us think well you know well if I if I

170
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,340
brag myself up it's you know I'm not

171
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,500
being humble but humility is not

172
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,489
thinking yourself less it's thinking

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:54,090
it's not thinking less of yourself it's

174
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,970
thinking of yourself less okay does that

175
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,210
make sense so ii realize that everyone

176
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,820
else is learning too alright everybody

177
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,250
else is in this state of growth you're

178
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,169
not the only one here that is trying to

179
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,000
figure this all out and looking at it

180
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,250
and being overwhelmed by it and saying

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,860
it's like eating out of a drinking out

182
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,470
of a fire hydrant that's coming directly

183
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,960
at you as you explore saint khan and

184
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,300
info sect in general know that no one

185
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,690
knows everything they're all learning

186
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,030
and that is the main reason that we're

187
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,389
all here at saint khan and that's the

188
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,968
main reason that we started st. khan in

189
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,279
the very very beginning was to give

190
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,229
everyone an opportunity to come

191
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,059
someplace that they could learn and grow

192
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,690
does that mean that you're gonna leave

193
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:45,900
saint khan as experts in that field no

194
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:48,930
it means you're gonna learn so much more

195
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,459
and have a better understanding of some

196
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,979
of the things that we taught at saint

197
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,599
khan so realize we're all there we're

198
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,360
all learning together

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,440
third recognize your own knowledge and

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,840
skills realize that you have value that

201
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,110
each of you have your expertise and some

202
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,540
of you have expertise that are different

203
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,760
in many different ways in fact each of

204
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,959
you have an expertise that is different

205
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,189
so recognize that recognize that value

206
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,740
each of you have something to contribute

207
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,590
to this community sometimes you might

208
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,640
come to the same kind of saying why I

209
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,190
and you might be looking when they

210
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,110
release the call for four presentations

211
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,620
and you think well what am I going to do

212
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:34,140
at sync on think about the things that

213
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,110
you do every day the things that you're

214
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,550
really really good at and I bet you you

215
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,800
can find something that you could

216
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,439
present on at st. con that would help

217
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,660
other people here we all have something

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,140
to contribute we all have something to

219
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,790
bring to the table so forth this is an

220
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,949
interesting side of it and this was

221
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,439
based on the BYU study have a life

222
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,790
outside of InfoSec is that kind of a

223
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,340
weird thing to say it in InfoSec

224
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,130
conference all right so the BYU study

225
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,560
that just barely completed just just a

226
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,820
few months ago the researchers concluded

227
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,579
that interviews with students at an

228
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,770
elite academic program to understand the

229
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,960
various coping mechanisms students used

230
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,210
to escape these feelings but one

231
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,630
particular method stood out above the

232
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:21,330
rest seeking social support from those

233
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,730
outside their academic program hey this

234
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,620
is this is the weird thing says the

235
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,900
findings of the interview study suggests

236
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,850
that if students reached in other

237
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,370
students within their major they felt

238
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,310
worse more often than they felt better

239
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,190
however students reached out to family

240
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,530
friends outside their major or even

241
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,410
professors perceptions of imposter isms

242
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,380
were reduced okay so have a life outside

243
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,230
of InfoSec this is really sometimes we

244
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,290
get into the groove and we just kind of

245
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,260
we that's all we do and you need to

246
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,790
realize it's good to have a life outside

247
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,650
of InfoSec as well okay so those outside

248
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,680
the social group seemed to be able to

249
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,660
help students see the big picture and

250
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,099
recalibrate the reference groups okay

251
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,839
said Ben RB

252
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,940
why you management professor co-author

253
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,790
of the study after reaching outside

254
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,740
their social group for support students

255
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,410
were able to understand themselves more

256
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,199
holistically rather than being so

257
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:28,980
focused on what they felt they lacked in

258
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:30,689
just one area lastly and finally know

259
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,269
that you're among friends here at st.

260
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,769

266

everything we can to make it welcoming

267
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,670
inviting and helpful and don't ever feel

268
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:59,459
like because you may lack knowledge in

269
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,370
one area that that you can't participate

270
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:05,008
we want you to participate and we want

271
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,230
to help you guide you through this and I

272
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,350
can tell you right now there's a ton of

273
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,290
stuff downstairs that I don't understand

274
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,870
okay but the cool thing is is every year

275
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,849
that I get to go and learn more about it

276
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,990
I understand it better so and that's it

277
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,259
that's the end of it

278
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,990
so please realize impostor syndrome is

279
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,870
normal and we all feel it

280
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,540
I feel it all the time every day and I

281
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,269
can't tell you how many times I've had

282
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,740
other people that are speaking at Def

283
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:43,019
Con speaking in large venues in InfoSec

284
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,709

285
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,300
