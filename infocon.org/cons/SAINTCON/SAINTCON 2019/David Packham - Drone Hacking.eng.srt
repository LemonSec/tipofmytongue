1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:12,330
okay hopefully everybody sign the

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:16,529
disclaimer on their way in you may get

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,930
cut injured maimed something in this

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,650
presentation so if that offends you

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,650
please leave

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:30,689
not really but maybe so talking about

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,570
drone hacking a little bit of my history

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,570
I started building drones back when they

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,770
were toys and we actually the the

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,629
picture on the upper left is not me I

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,100
was not around in that black and white

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:50,129
era I was born after they invented color

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,870
so that was good but on the on the right

14
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,430
hand side that was some of the first

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,149
drones we built and we built him out of

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,940
numchucks

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,379
and Weez the guts for the nunchuck and

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,329
the we in the bottom left there that's

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,039
one of the weak controllers so we had to

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,309
get the accelerometer and the gyros out

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,520
of him and then we ended up doing a

22
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,869
competition for UAV forge which is DARPA

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,600
Department of Defense because they

24
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,240
wanted to see how well just normal

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,220
hackers could build a drone and fly it

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,860
into their city their mock city and

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,100
could they evade us and we got second

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,650
prize a second place no one got first

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,289
which was interesting but we were

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,520
awarded second I mean that's a totally

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:37,979
long story so why are we hacking UAVs

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,770
drones well for the first reason we own

33
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:44,100
the hardware it's ours right and if we

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,500
can hack our phones right we can put our

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,020
own roms and unlock our own phones we

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,159
should be able to unlock our car our

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,000
house our IOT stuff our UAVs our drones

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,399
or whatever's right so some common

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,700
misconceptions common questions and I

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,689
really wish this room was full of

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,439
non-technical people instead of people

42
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,090
that are intelligent can you hack can

43
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,090
you hack my drone while it's in the air

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,770
no not really right so this guy this

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,950
little Wi-Fi connected

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,720
open wrt SSID connected no encryption

47
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,190
wide open I can send commands to it yeah

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,900
I can knock it into a wall

49
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:31,290
yippee right this one DJI spark no it's

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,100
encrypted right uses the same protocols

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,100
but it has not Wi-Fi at all you can't

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,480
see it as an access point just using the

53
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,630
2.4 gigahertz can a drone get dropped

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,450
with a Wi-Fi gun right there are several

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,670
manufacturers that have these Wi-Fi guns

56
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,850
out there one of them right here in

57
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,589
Pleasant Grove and what they actually do

58
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,680
is they don't actually command and

59
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,050
control your drone they actually just

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,190
completely bathe it in every frequency

61
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,530
that's possible that it can think and it

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,180
loses its brain and most of the

63
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,520
intelligent drones when they lose their

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,500
orientation of their brain either do an

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,250
RTC which is return to China which is

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,630
where they came from so it's only normal

67
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,790
or they do a land right so yes yeah if

68
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,049
you have you know 10 to 80 thousand

69
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,230
dollars laying around you can get these

70
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:37,830
drones guns shotguns work just as well

71
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,679
but shooting anything out of the air is

72
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,620
a federal offense

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,440
ok people need to understand that this

74
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,250
is owned by the city assuming this is

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,359
your your grass in your front yard this

76
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,950
all the way up to there is owned by the

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,190
FCC which is a federal agency FCC FAA

78
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:03,839
the other one not the fbb with the FAA

79
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,760
right so so if you shoot something out

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,610
of the air Amazon or Google's flying

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,320
over to deliver their coffee of the week

82
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,800
and you shoot it that's a federal

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,549
offense

84
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,720
so that's on your own can drones send

85
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,670
home data big panic China bad people no

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,890
you know we can't fly drones that send

87
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,900
our data back to China they don't

88
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,830
actually if you opt into their

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,690
service you know it'll give analytics

90
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,440
the government and the military both

91
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,449
have vetted DJI drones and they've even

92
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,610
come out with an enterprise version of

93
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:44,150
their software if you're that freaked

94
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,610
out that shows you everything that it's

95
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,109
collecting or you just use a different

96
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,789
app there's several apps out there you

97
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,979
can fly the DJI drones one's called

98
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:56,030
lychee that doesn't do anything and it's

99
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:59,090
all visible to you can my city slash

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,039
campus tell me I can't fly drones the

101
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,609
University of Utah has a no drone policy

102
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,229
right now can they actually do that not

103
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,930
really right

104
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,260
my homeowners association can't do that

105
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,610
either

106
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:16,760
what they can say is I can't take off of

107
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,389
their land which they don't own but I

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,900
own so that's fuzzy but as soon as I'm

109
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:26,000
in the air I'm in federal airspace right

110
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,729
so National Park can't fly over your

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,770
Yellowstone you can if you're standing

112
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,710
one foot outside of the National Park

113
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,919
you can take off and fly anywhere you

114
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,630
want in federal airspace if you drop and

115
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,919
fall game over right so can my

116
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,289
homeowner's association telling me I

117
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,740
can't fly on their grass no absolutely

118
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,520
not

119
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,860
should I listen to them I probably

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,430
should right because there's probably

121
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,830
some person there who's got hearing aids

122
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,560
that go whack-job when the drones fly

123
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,919
over and I should be nice right I can go

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,090
find a park or a beautiful mountain

125
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,198
right can you avoid unhappy people Yeah

126
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,729
right

127
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,889
like I always say if you can get rid of

128
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,919
the meatspace all of our problems will

129
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:22,010
go away

130
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:26,180
meatspace being humans can you actually

131
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:31,729
get around the FAA laws yes you can here

132
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:35,580
it is this drone right here the DJI

133
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:38,070
spark weighs over 300 and some odd grams

134
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,359
FAA regulations say that you don't have

135
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,680
to regulate anything that weighs less

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,830
than two sticks of butter or 250 grams

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,690
because Americans don't understand grams

138
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:54,840
unless it's in a baggie right cuz it's

139
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,340
two fingers of grams anyways but so they

140
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,799
had to translate it into two sticks of

141
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:04,260
butter the new Mavic air that just did

142
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:08,430
the FCC is 240 grams right so you can

143
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:11,159
buy a real legit DJI drone that is

144
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,780
lighter than the FAA mandates mandates

145
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,310
and regulations does this mean you can

146
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:19,559
be an idiot yes no if you raised your

147
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,820
hand you're gonna be an idiot anyways so

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,740
no you can't so what are uses for

149
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,050
hacking your drone right

150
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,720
why is dark matter have to carry this

151
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,110
stuff around why can't he just put a

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,790
drone under it and fly it around they

153
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,980
did that at Def Con in Vegas add some

154
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:42,690
airplanes that would do war planing or

155
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:47,820
driving finding SS ids something gonna

156
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:51,060
blow up there's like this increasing its

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,730
increasing winding noise but the biggest

158
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,170
thing is geo evasion is what some people

159
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:01,590
call it big media people geo evasion to

160
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:05,100
me means I'm going to get a really good

161
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:09,330
picture of something and I have my fa

162
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,220
part 107 license and/or there's no one

163
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,469
here and I'm on the backside of timp but

164
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I want to get a picture but for some

165
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,050
reason this app says I can't fly here

166
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,410
DJI actually makes several features in

167
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,470
their app that allow you to bypass those

168
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,810
and go on but the media calls it goe

169
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,400
evasion right there's places I shouldn't

170
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,420
fly like the White House front lawn

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,370
right

172
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,840
I shouldn't fly over the University of

173
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,820
Utah while they're playing a game right

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,320
and it probably shouldn't fly into your

175
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,700
air man when they're trying to take off

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,150
or land because that's my fault

177
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:46,770
right so back in the day it's somewhere

178
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,760
I have a slide for it back in the day

179
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,550
used to be able to Steph TP to the drone

180
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,970
zero-day exploit changed it config it

181
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,839
was real easy right and DGI came out and

182
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,339
said oh we're gonna make it more

183
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,019
difficult we're gonna encrypt all of our

184
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,199
code and blah blah blah and everybody

185
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:06,190
would be happy cuz it is right well I

186
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:07,810
own the hardware I don't own the

187
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,820
intellectual property for the software

188
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,920
but I sort of own the code that's on my

189
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,459
drone right sort of you can sort of

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,630
stretch it that way so I'm stuck in this

191
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:21,399
middle so we always encourage customers

192
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,120
to strictly follow their local rules

193
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,800
right yeh

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,470
lawyers wrote this but it's interesting

195
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,829
that he says and this is the director of

196
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,540
security he says things like

197
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:39,519
unauthorized modifications are not

198
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,500
recommended which means to me absolutely

199
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,449
go for it right

200
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,970
you're gonna void your warranty but

201
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,670
everything I own is voided anyways by

202
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,649
the two minutes into my house

203
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,709
but even then State Farm Insurance for

204
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,860
$60 a year can cover it even though the

205
00:09:53,709 --> 00:10:00,670
warranty is void by the way don't ask me

206
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,040
how I know so they asked the guy one of

207
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,910
the one of the people that hide their

208
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,269
name that if that is reversed engineered

209
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,569
a file that was freely downloaded from

210
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:15,730
Amazon bitbucket that had DGI security

211
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:19,029
key in it but they used to sign all

212
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,829
their their code with it was freely

213
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:23,110
given out so he freely took it and

214
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,149
freely wrote a bunch of apps called a

215
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,610
Dumbledore and Dumble rub and blah blah

216
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:31,569
that actually take the code from the DJI

217
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,730
drone download it decrypt it and move on

218
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,670
right and he's like you know this was

219
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,260
just an enticing thing I just got to go

220
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:46,000
so the front page news is saying oh shut

221
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,410
down Starbucks in London for two hours

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,319
and people couldn't get their coffee and

223
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,860
they're pissed right drones shut down

224
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,750
Gatwick Airport anybody hear that one

225
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,240
for like three days they wouldn't let a

226
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,640
single plane take our for land and one

227
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
report was like there's 15 drones flying

228
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,699
over and we've seen weapons

229
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,709
the bottom of these drones and mass

230
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:08,508
chaos and hysteria cats and dogs and

231
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,920
poor it's amazing

232
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:16,009
okay April 28th 2019 Gatwick Airport was

233
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,319
closed like I don't know how many

234
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,350
flights four hundred forty thousand

235
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:23,540
passengers pissed because they can't get

236
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:33,040
somewhere and they're living in an

237
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:33,040
airport that's not my area of fun so

238
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,180
yeah so the police investigated of

239
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,329
course because they're called right they

240
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,209
actually arrested this couple man and

241
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:46,008
wife who were in Gatwick Park flying a

242
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,660
drone about 25 feet off the ground

243
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:54,079
taking a picture of their kid playing on

244
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:57,939
a playset it wasn't them they were

245
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,180
released but they spent a lot of money

246
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:06,050
okay

247
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:08,000
next month you'll love this someone

248
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,339
spent about I don't know I was like

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
eight million eight point nine billion

250
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,990
million pounds or whatever cuz they're

251
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,410
European we're English we'd I don't it's

252
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,949
all metric right so it's a lot of money

253
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:28,040
they spent a ton of money and it went to

254
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:30,920
some cousins nephews sister company who

255
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,980
runs drone security for airports and now

256
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,750
Gatwick all sudden got funding so they

257
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,339
listen to their hacker because every

258
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,839
hacker in this room knows that the only

259
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,519
time you get funding out of the suits is

260
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,519
within two weeks of an incident right

261
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:52,008
hmm let's create an incident and let's

262
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,040
get funding we got funding boom so that

263
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,540
was an old non-issue

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,459
okay so old-school here there are the

265
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,170
commands if you have an old-school drone

266
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:03,229
you have an updated your firmware in a

267
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,110
while you can actually use that map to

268
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,889
find the IP address are on and you can

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,690
actually FTP to it and port 21 is open

270
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,319
and

271
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,690
you know picket choice script kiddie

272
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:19,620
script and run it against it Metasploit

273
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:23,589
has it built in and boom you got a CLI

274
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:27,750
in that CLI you'll just awesomely notice

275
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:30,399
the DJ runs Android go google write

276
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,759
Linux kernel boots up loads a bunch of

277
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,709
DJ our Android modules and it's just the

278
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,899
exact same environment that you know you

279
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:40,329
do an LS you can go into temp you can go

280
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,259
into user bin user Lib you can download

281
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:44,609
anything you want

282
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:49,120
then there's this gorgeous XML file

283
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,920
tools galore now there's this XML file

284
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
now that we've been in there and now

285
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,389
that we have the security key now what

286
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,370
do we do there's a bunch of cool tools

287
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:02,139
that have been written because we liked

288
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:05,379
right tools to do menial tasks that go

289
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:08,829
and grab this XML download it allow you

290
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:11,470
to modify it and change the aspects and

291
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:14,349
flight characteristics of your UAV that

292
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:17,350
you own if you bottom AdvoCare that's

293
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,459
sort of like the Windows Vista of the

294
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,110
DJI air DG I land and they won't no

295
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,500
one's gonna buy it does anybody here

296
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:31,000
have them AdvoCare yeah okay good spire

297
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,939
people okay so if you do damage I'm not

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,980
responsible if you have a cat I don't

299
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:40,589
know why Microsoft just came up with a

300
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:44,889
suggestion of putting a cat on this so

301
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:46,449
don't do stupid things so what kind of

302
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:49,240
things can you do how can you hack your

303
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:51,370
drone what would you want and why would

304
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,610
you want to hack your drone height

305
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,000
limitations okay part of the law says

306
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,470
you can only fly 400 feet right part of

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
the other law if you continue to read it

308
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,370
says you can only fly 400 feet above

309
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,750
whatever you're flying over downtown

310
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,839
Salt Lake City there's some pretty big

311
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,360
buildings I can go 400 feet over the 900

312
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,850
feet building that's legal absolutely

313
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,000
because if you're a pilot and real plane

314
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,220
pilot rocks here military guys nobody ok

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,750
cool

316
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:27,019
so everything I say is true

317
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:28,670
no no combat here if you're if you want

318
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,009
to fly high to take a picture you can if

319
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,160
you're flying in a plane big plane

320
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:36,259
you're supposed to stay you know so many

321
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,209
feet a thousand feet or so above any

322
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,350
objects over here in downtown so I like

323
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,949
city you're supposed to stay a thousand

324
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,920
feet anyways

325
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:45,079
there's airspace you can remove no-fly

326
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,849
zones and geo fencing geo research notes

327
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:52,250
you should definitely beware of your

328
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:55,160
no-fly zones the building that we are

329
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,079
staffed in right now in downtown Salt

330
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,459
Lake City is about a hundred feet out of

331
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,829
the no-fly zone for Salt Lake City

332
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,758
Airport so if I go out our front door I

333
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:05,989
can fly up to a hundred feet because the

334
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,939
upside-down wedding cake that flight

335
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,889
zones are if I go to the other side of

336
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:11,029
the building

337
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,879
other than being a federal office I

338
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,379
can't take off and land but if I wanted

339
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,930
to take a picture of a riot at the

340
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:21,290
federal office I think you know I could

341
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:24,050
legally or not unlock it right

342
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,389
got a lay-oh satellite reception gotta

343
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,180
have that I went to Italy flew my drone

344
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,410
it was cool over there police officers

345
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,540
came up to me all the time they like to

346
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,129
do what model is that oh it's the spark

347
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,750
yeah that's cool can I see what pictures

348
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,149
you're taking yeah sure hair look cool

349
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,470
okay cool great one guy gave me his

350
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,000
email address because I took a picture

351
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,740
of him and I in front of this big

352
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,980
Cathedral is that can you send that to

353
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,180
me

354
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,040
okay good battery warnings batteries are

355
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,180
always your vendors are weird about

356
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,860
their batteries and they always jump

357
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,359
things early when when the motors can be

358
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,819
started when they can be turned off if

359
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,430
you take a stock DJI drone and you turn

360
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:02,899
it more than thirty degrees one of those

361
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,280
that's another metric thing I don't

362
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,900
understand

363
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,970
if you turn more than thirty degrees a

364
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,010
motor show off that to me is sort of

365
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,299
dumb but you can hack that and keep the

366
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,750
motors on the whole time so you can do

367
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,309
flips right now motor errors does not

368
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,890
require an internal SD card if you don't

369
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,899
want to precision return to home they

370
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,380
actually fudge the return to home

371
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,970
position precision so it's not exact you

372
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,299
can set that parameter to zero so it's

373
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,450
exact don't know why they did that

374
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:34,260
anyways enabled slower blah blah blah

375
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,960
new FCC mode so you

376
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,690
and transmitter to higher power here in

377
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,130
the US then you can overseas but if you

378
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,280
go overseas and change this one to a

379
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,990
zero now you can transmit us and you can

380
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,850
optionally disable all the LEDs on the

381
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,560
light right because it's sort of sucks

382
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,719
when you're taking a picture at night or

383
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,950
in the evening you see this flash of red

384
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,310
so you turn them off all this data is

385
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:02,160
stored in this SQLite database we all

386
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,020
know how to hack that and you can drag

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,940
right in there they're no flight zones

388
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,960
are all carried in a no sequel database

389
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,750
or sequel Lite database and they update

390
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,400
this and add NF Z's no flying zones all

391
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,830
the time

392
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,050
there was actually an app that was

393
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,970
delivered by some guys that said you

394
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,790
could add your your home as a no-fly

395
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,740
zone and everybody's like yeah everybody

396
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,389
clicking on oh you know it's on CNN and

397
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,650
Fox and everybody's like hey just turn

398
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,910
your home into a no-fly zone and then

399
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,620
your neighbor can't fly on it and then

400
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,730
they're like well hold on this isn't

401
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,659
legal can't do this

402
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,530
we're not gonna do this so yeah so looks

403
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,150
like a cell phone

404
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:44,399
probably the same hardware as a cell

405
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:45,990
phone that's got a fan cool things off

406
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,290
it's got a lot of metal and plastic

407
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,910
stuff so there's you know some ways to

408
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,620
go in and hack it but how are you gonna

409
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:57,540
get a picture like this right well you

410
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,100
have to change all these parameters for

411
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:04,020
63 to 9000 for 66 to 0 for 67 to 0 blah

412
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,040
blah blah and then you can fly up and

413
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,180
I'm still less than 400 feet above the

414
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,170
arch I'm good

415
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,930
according to some people so here's the

416
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,570
here's the command options on how to do

417
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,240
so and that's a lot of blah blah blah

418
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,250
and of course when you install this

419
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,760
software to do the hacking you just

420
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:29,430
click OK on everything right it's like

421
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,510
this little thing up here just plug it

422
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,350
in your computer don't care about it I

423
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,750
was just reading an article about

424
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,550
somebody somebody got hacked at a

425
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,700
conference because the guy gave him a

426
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,899
clicker to plug in right I went and

427
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,590
asked him if he had a clicker and he's

428
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,740
like

429
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:51,110
just playin so no clicker for me yeah

430
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,539
that's not why I didn't do it anyway so

431
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:57,439
I can't really read what that says and

432
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:00,950
the publishers right is clicked ok so

433
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,720
now let's let's try to do a live demo I

434
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,710
know how this goes

435
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,600
not chanting for anybody but these are

436
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,519
the rules on live demos the demo grabbed

437
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,439
web page so if you want read through

438
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:19,129
those so we'll actually go to the demo

439
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:22,179
and what I want to do is I want to show

440
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:26,389
you guys the newest way to hack a drug

441
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:34,070
so nowadays let me fire this up really

442
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:35,990
quick has to be powered on obviously but

443
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,450
nowadays there's a DJI assistant

444
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,879
application and it's really cool and

445
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,220
it's really written in new modern

446
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:48,619
protocols and you install this app and

447
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:54,460
you can't see my screen did I do

448
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:54,459
something wrong can you see my screen

449
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,509
can I borrow your clicker

450
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:21,559
I'm good catch unplug and plug well

451
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:26,019
maybe there's like that oh you guys

452
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,019
can't see my screen that really blows oh

453
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:35,539
please oh yeah demo gods yeah windows 10

454
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,600
tell me about it yeah there's some

455
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:41,269
pictures I don't want to show anybody

456
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,399
all right so you install this app the DG

457
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,899
is system and it runs through and it's

458
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,639
built with all these new cool tools and

459
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:47,840
everything's written in JavaScript and

460
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,580
everything's on the file system and

461
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,199
nothing is encrypted and I don't know

462
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,610
what they were thinking but it allows

463
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,220
you back inside

464
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,350
so you install it you take this one file

465
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,720
called mange s I have no idea what that

466
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,100
means and you copy it over to this

467
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,850
directory and then you run DGI assistant

468
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,559
of course you say yes to everything and

469
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,330
when you go in here it brings open this

470
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,730
little side window which I've never seen

471
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,269
before my life on a browser because this

472
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,379
is sort of like a browser application I

473
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,809
need to navigate down here to local

474
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:25,519
storage you go to files and you say

475
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:28,580
debug yeah sure let's debug because we

476
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:32,029
like debug and then I click on my spark

477
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,549
and it goes through and downloads all

478
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:38,929
the debugger options and all the entries

479
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:42,830
but if you also look down here there's a

480
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,539
list called parameters which has every

481
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:49,158
single parameter that's stuck in that

482
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:52,009
XML file right so if I go through my

483
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:55,669
nifty list and I say okay if I want to

484
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:57,830
turn on really fast mode I search for

485
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,629
this parameter and I set it to 50 if I

486
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,178
want to turn on vertical up and down so

487
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:04,908
I can lean more into the wind great

488
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,950
right if I want to do more tilt if I

489
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:10,369
want to be able to do flips if I want to

490
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,410
have precision GPS landing yeah okay

491
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:15,530
flight areas fiction

492
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:19,160
I just change a 1 to a 0 or 0 to a 1 and

493
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:21,790
now I have to use my brain to say hmm

494
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,430
should I be flying in here right

495
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:28,700
probably probably not maybe you guys all

496
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,220
sliding the nondisclosure so I should

497
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,010
and then what home what was the I don't

498
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,410
know one so there's a go home velocity

499
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,090
right you think I'm low on batteries

500
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,559
let's just get home because I'm gonna

501
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,169
die and we're gonna follow wherever we

502
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,389
are right so they said this really slow

503
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,240
it's not even your normal speed it just

504
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,460
cruises it's like oh okay this is a

505
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,050
funny way to allow me to sell more

506
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,850
batteries or sell more drones because

507
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,470
they y'all see that movie that guy

508
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,510
running through the lake trying to grab

509
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,929
his drone noise so you can set the

510
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:02,450
return to home policy right there it is

511
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,250
a policy I believe and then you can set

512
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,820
all the other device settings flight

513
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:11,630
settings you can go into batteries it's

514
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:16,090
somewhere here you can turn off that and

515
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:18,230
then you connect disconnect and save and

516
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,300
this is this is the other thing I want

517
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,730
them to show you so there's this app

518
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,940
called dank drones don't know how to

519
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,910
translate that not gonna look it up and

520
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:32,510
it goes out and it actually downloads

521
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,130
from several sites that are in a list

522
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,370
that I don't want to look at because

523
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:40,850
then I complete ignorance all custom

524
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,860
roms for these and every background so

525
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,780
if you want if so if DJI gets to the

526
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,760
point where they're okay

527
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,440
the current ROM is signed and you can't

528
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:54,559
break it there's an app called

529
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:59,150
Dumbledore right here where I can

530
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:01,280
actually run it and what it does yes

531
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,190
assistant to is not closed all right

532
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:09,080
close it there's only one thing you can

533
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,700
use the come port at a time windows so

534
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,860
what it does is it actually goes in

535
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,470
downloads

536
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,620
well dink download or while its while

537
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,580
it's uploading or downloading it's

538
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,810
getting me the roms

539
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,610
Dumbledore here allows me to load the

540
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,169
firmware

541
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,490
onto the machine and after after the

542
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,580
security guy DG I said we're gonna fix

543
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,320
this problem what he just meant is you

544
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,189
can still exploit it but we made it more

545
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,770
difficult challenge accepted right so

546
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,230
now you have to upload and and

547
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,770
Dumbledore does this automatically it

548
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,809
uploads to bypass roms and it actually

549
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,179
reboots twice puts it into a bootloader

550
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,160
mode puts it into a reverse debug

551
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,049
bootloader mode and then it allows it

552
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,450
any rum so even though they've updated

553
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:00,730
their rum to be keyed you can still go

554
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,040
back to the old rom and that's what

555
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,260
Dumbledore does so then after you back

556
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,909
in the old ROM you can go and modify any

557
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,629
of these I&I settings and do whatever

558
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:14,260
you want were either drum alrighty so

559
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,610
that is downloading here is an

560
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,429
interesting thing if you look at this

561
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:21,010
this is actually a decrypted not a

562
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:23,020
decrypted yet but this is what the ROM

563
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,750
is and if you look at that there's a

564
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,000
kernel at the top and then there's all

565
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,500
these modules okay you have a module for

566
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,690
the motors you have a modules for

567
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,510
control you have a module for camera you

568
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:37,240
have a module for no flying zones

569
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:40,960
deleted okay I got a module for speed

570
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,799
control modified okay I have a module

571
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,360
for all the fancy cool moves that you

572
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,690
can do with a drone and hand control and

573
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,049
Jedi stuff deleted added and they're all

574
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,970
loaded modules and they don't do checks

575
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:55,720
so you can inject anything because they

576
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,400
think they have a nice secure

577
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:03,130
environment for this so without much ado

578
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,350
oh okay here we go so here's all the

579
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,990
models I know you guys can read all that

580
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,540
because it's great print you go pick

581
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,720
what you want and say okay I have a

582
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:16,750
spark and here's all the old revs of the

583
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,049
tool of the software and I just say you

584
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:23,380
know download it boom I have all the

585
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:26,950
copies of roms and everybody keeps

586
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:34,980
copies and roms right so then you unplug

587
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,980
your drone and you reboot it

588
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:44,039
okay I'm really interested to see if it

589
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:51,750
still flies last time I did this at a

590
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:55,139
con it took off and did an RTC so we'll

591
00:27:51,750 --> 00:28:00,450
see if it works see if the Jedi trick

592
00:27:55,139 --> 00:28:05,689
works yeah okay double tap the back it

593
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,690
sees me okay take off

594
