1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,070
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:13,620
great to have you here last session of

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,990
the day he told me because we're last

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,779
that it's okay for us to go up until 7

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,710
o'clock I don't plan on doing that

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,600
because I want to get home too but we

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,130
have the most important people here so

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,130
we'll go ahead and get started so

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:39,329
several years ago I was the head of IT

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:42,718
in in a law firm we had our headquarters

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,950
down in San Diego we had representation

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,960
in six states we had an office in Mexico

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,270
the type of law that we practiced was

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,930
such that we were in an extremely

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,140
regulated industry and so the notes that

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:03,600
we took on behalf of our clients really

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,729
had to be pretty pristine and the nature

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,820
of the type of law that we practiced was

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,840
it was very transactional and so it was

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,880
not uncommon for our firm to have you

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,100
know a hundred thousand transactions in

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,009
a day and depending on the day in the

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,330
month and and where we were I mean we

24
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,490
could push two hundred three hundred

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,369
thousand transactions and and all of

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,710
these transactions had to be there and

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,470
correct and available all the time and

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,110
when I first got hired onto the firm

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:40,470
they had just purchased a new system and

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,899
and so the first probably about year of

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,829
my job we were migrating from this old

32
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,020
system into this new system and I'm sure

33
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,579
that I've probably been the only one to

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,520
ever have a major IT project go south

35
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,798
but it did and it was it was it was

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,158
really quite painful for the firm as a

37
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,270
whole but we we were able to kind of

38
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,820
plow our way through it we got

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,489
everything stabilized and up and running

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,228
we got everybody trained on this new

41
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,400
system and things were running pretty

42
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,060
smoothly about 18 months

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,700
into the project and spent the next six

44
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,370
months really kind of doing some you

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,040
know baselines and you know okay we're

46
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,780
really are we and so about two years

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,900
into my employment there I went to the

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,720
owner of the firm it was a Friday

49
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,159
afternoon and and I told him I said I

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,829
want you to think about something over

51
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,950
the weekend and then let's get back

52
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:39,670
together on Monday and and we can talk

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,890
about this

54
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,000
and and kind of come up with a plan so

55
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,208
if you can't just think how much

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,829
downtime is acceptable if we had

57
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,530
something where the system went down

58
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:56,829
how much downtime is acceptable for the

59
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:02,079
business well he just immediately

60
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:05,200
responded zero zero downtime I said okay

61
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:09,489
well let me tell you what that means

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,280
and and so I started explaining we need

63
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,319
to create a hot site and it's gotta be

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,250
in a geographically different location

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,410
and it's got and I started listing

66
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:25,989
everything that is needed in order to

67
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:28,000
ensure availability of 100% and he

68
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,400
looked at me and he said that is

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,720
ridiculous

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,410
well that's what that's what it takes to

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,900
have zero downtime and but the

72
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,840
conversation was great because it opened

73
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,579
the door for us to talk about how to

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,370
approach IT our approach cybersecurity

75
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:51,489
and how to do this kind of on a

76
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,049
risk-based basis and so we still agreed

77
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,970
that we're gonna take the weekend to

78
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,620
kind of really kind of work through this

79
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,199
and then get back on Monday and start

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,609
developing a plan on what we're going to

81
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:08,169
do moving forward to be able to in the

82
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:10,449
most cost effective way ensure the least

83
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,489
amount of downtime of up to a certain

84
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:16,209
point where he was comfortable with that

85
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,889
and and it took us a little bit of time

86
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,228
to actually put all of that into place

87
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,510
as well but but we were able to finally

88
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,340
get it to a point where the technology

89
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,310
was there and we were able to support

90
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:33,070
the support the business and and be able

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:35,110
to function and so one of the things

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,440
that just as we kind of get going here

93
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:42,550
you know mine is not a technical talk I

94
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,510
know that this is st. Cohn and its

95
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,270
really a great time in the year to get

96
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,479
together and and really get your geek on

97
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,389
and they've got a lot of real fun games

98
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,180
and and I appreciate it this this is

99
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,300
really a lot of fun to come and do this

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,650
but mine's not technical so if you're

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,150
looking for the the next new trick on

102
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,840
what you can do with a computer that

103
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,210
that's not me so I I'm a I am a business

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,039
man that really has a good grasp of

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,930
technology and so that's where my focus

106
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:23,320
is okay so we have here in the news this

107
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,270
is August August 30th when this article

108
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,639
came out this is just less than two

109
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,240
months ago and you can see they're

110
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:35,190
criminals use voice AI to steal money

111
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,740
and right there at the beginning of it

112
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,029
you can see you know cyber criminals

113
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,400
impersonated the voice of the company's

114
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:48,479
executive and was able to walk away with

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,810
over two hundred thousand dollars and

116
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:57,219
you know there's a lot of talk now about

117
00:05:51,810 --> 00:06:00,190
AI about deep fakes and you know some of

118
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:04,539
the technologies that that are being

119
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,669
developed now you know and and so this

120
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,130
is really kind of a timely you know in

121
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,900
in terms of that conversation but I want

122
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,630
to kind of zero in on this you know the

123
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,729
executive okay it was the executives

124
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:19,690
voice and when the executive speaks if

125
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,360
it's the CEO what do you do you move

126
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,590
right the CEO has declared so that's how

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,770
it shall be

128
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,280
okay and so here this is actually just

129
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,490
last week okay just last week executives

130
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,109
are not actively engaged in ensuring the

131
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,510
effectiveness of the cybersecurity

132
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,110
strategy now please

133
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:45,469
don't raise your hand don't move your

134
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:51,290
head so that we nobody knows but how

135
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:53,210
many of you say that's my company my

136
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,730
executives aren't supportive they're not

137
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,180
there they're not behind the cyber

138
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:03,490
security initiatives okay now thinking

139
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:14,840
about this again don't raise your hands

140
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:17,420
which half are you in okay so is your

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,190
cyber security strategy today I mean if

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,240
you have been with the organization for

143
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,940
three months

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,590
obviously it's it is going to be new but

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,570
if your site if you've been there for a

146
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,090
while do you have the same cyber

147
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,390
security strategy that you did a year

148
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,630
ago two years ago three years ago and so

149
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:40,570
if you are not engaging with your

150
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:43,130
executive level on cyber security then

151
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,010
why is there an expectation that they

152
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,330
need to engage back does that make sense

153
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:53,240
okay

154
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:57,349
so how do your executives see you are

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,300
you this mystic you know the you know

156
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,990
like me my office is down in the

157
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,970
basement

158
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,890
I tell them they gave me a corner office

159
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,170
which they did it just happens to be in

160
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,510
the basement you know but but there's

161
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,520
this mysticism right you open up a

162
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,340
computer chassis and you look down at

163
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,260
the motherboard and what is all of that

164
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,299
and so there's a certain mysticism

165
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,050
that's there and so do your executives

166
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:27,650
look at you like this white eyed mystic

167
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:31,360
or maybe that's you yeah just love your

168
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,130
computers and when you talk to them it's

169
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:40,700
you talk a lot of the lingo and a lot of

170
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:43,309
the jargon of IT or maybe that's you you

171
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,800
know and so what's really important when

172
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,160
speaking with executives you have to

173
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,790
talk their language and so if you're

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,990
mystic or you're geeky

175
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,520
in that conversation you may have that

176
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,150
problem where the executives really

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,060
aren't engaged because they don't know

178
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,319
what you're talking about there's really

179
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,829
funny I was I was doing a presentation

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:13,900
someplace else and I was kind of curious

181
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:15,850
how to make something sound tech jargony

182
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,189
and there's you can actually you know

183
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,260
you can go and use your DuckDuckGo and

184
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,410
find out and and just put it in there

185
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,960
there's an app online where you can ask

186
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,459
it to spit back to you how much do you

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,870
want and it's just a whole bunch of tech

188
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,020
jargon that sounds really cool that

189
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,250
means absolutely nothing and so but a

190
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,290
lot of times when you're talking your

191
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,730
executives and unless they are they do

192
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,319
have that tech background that they're

193
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,710
just they're not going to understand and

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,140
so so this this concept of developing a

195
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,050
strategy and you know presenting that

196
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:52,180
strategy is important that they need to

197
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:56,260
be able to recognize says this as we

198
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,030
work with them now through the course of

199
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,439
developing the strategy basically what

200
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,540
it is that we're doing is we're trying

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,540
to develop this roadmap you know we want

202
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:08,020
to get from one place and get to another

203
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,819
place and so you know this from here to

204
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,670
there this is what we're trying to

205
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,340
accomplish and and our jobs in

206
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,969
cybersecurity because we are kind of a

207
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,800
special breed in in technology is that

208
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,280
we have to be able to translate this out

209
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,310
this is what we need to be in this is

210
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:32,560
where we need to go and so in strategy

211
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,349
I'll let you read this but you know

212
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
definition of strategy but the things

213
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,890
that I want to kind of point out

214
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,720
specifically in this is that it is

215
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:46,140
explicit explicit means that it is

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,370
defines perfect specifically defined

217
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,610
you're gonna hand somebody a piece of

218
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,430
paper and you can say this is it and it

219
00:10:51,610 --> 00:11:00,250
can be read it is explicit this is an

220
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:03,189
explicit path for what you vision the

221
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,740
future to be okay

222
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,610
that makes sense okay yeah you have to

223
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:14,040
be specific so this is a life-size

224
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,440
lifecycle of strategy where are you in

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,810
your organization and with cybersecurity

226
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,660
and where's the technology if you don't

227
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,760
know where you are

228
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,760
how can you effectively build that road

229
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,080
map to where you want to be okay so you

230
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,090
have to go through that assessment

231
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:37,210
process you have to define where you are

232
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:38,650
identify where you want to be and then

233
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,680
you pull out the map and say okay how do

234
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,720
I get there okay it's not quite so easy

235
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,040
you can't pull up Google Maps because

236
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,040
it's not going to be able to tell you

237
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,990
okay so but but you have to create that

238
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:58,360
map for the business I want to have

239
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,670
these things in place by this time okay

240
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,740
and then as you go through this process

241
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,490
you do your monitoring and measuring

242
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,260
okay tactics though this is the

243
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,270
day-to-day tasks this is what you're

244
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,420
going to do on a daily basis on a weekly

245
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:18,069
basis on a monthly basis to ensure that

246
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,140
you are staying on the road okay that

247
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,240
you haven't veered off on on some

248
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,130
tangent that that when you when you got

249
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,830
up to the spaghetti bowl that you didn't

250
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,830
get to the wrong freeway that you made

251
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,560
the right lane changes okay so you have

252
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,350
to be able to to do these iterative

253
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,020
processes to to know that you're still

254
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,220
on track and what are we going to do to

255
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,120
get us down that road and that's what

256
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:49,570
our tactics are and so you can see the

257
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,000
tactics fall into that roadmap okay now

258
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,540
the relationship between these two suits

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,940
on art of war you have to have both you

260
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,040
have to have a strategy and you have to

261
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,290
have appropriate tactics if you're

262
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,709
actually going to make this work okay

263
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:12,449
and then right here's our little

264
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:16,330
quadrant if you have a an explicit path

265
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:20,110
to a specific destination

266
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,390
and you have good tactics good means to

267
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:27,150
get there you're going to have quick

268
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:29,650
success if you don't have a plan and

269
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,900
you're not sure what you're going to do

270
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,270
and you just wing it you wake up in the

271
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,829
morning put your finger up in the air

272
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,890
said okay this is the way the wind is

273
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,930
blowing this is what we need to do

274
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,360
you're going you're gonna have failure

275
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,949
and you're going to fail quickly okay

276
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,440
but of course if you have a good plan

277
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,660
but just bad tactics you'll get there

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,100
eventually it's just going to take a lot

279
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,069
of time okay

280
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,230
so in order to be able to work with your

281
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,560
executive level in order to be able to

282
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:04,230
be successful in in getting from here to

283
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:07,300
there please develop a specific plan and

284
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,940
then develop how what are we going to do

285
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,640
to get us there

286
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,960
okay so it is October and we're right in

287
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,340
the middle football season so I thought

288
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,760
I'd do a little bit of football to kind

289
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,660
of help illustrate this red X's is the

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:26,590
offense blue circles is the defense okay

291
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:30,270
any football fans out here yeah okay so

292
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:32,800
what kind of good offense is this

293
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,079
offensive plays anybody know this is

294
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,060
pretty good for passing right you take a

295
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,280
look at that you've got three wide

296
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,959
receivers out there yeah right there on

297
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,510
the right hand side kind of setback you

298
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,430
maybe have your tight end he can be a

299
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,200
good blocker or maybe he'll just kind of

300
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,930
roll out and be able to pick up a pass

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,140
for a few yards okay this is a good

302
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:57,430
setup if you've got a strong passing

303
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:01,930
strategy right if you have a good run

304
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:04,079
strategy then you have this kind of a

305
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,699
setup maybe you have somebody out there

306
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,610
depending on the the particular plays

307
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,100
that you run may kind of shift the way

308
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,410
this is set up but this is a good run

309
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,570
strategy or of course you can also have

310
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,870
the five-year-old Pop Warner strategy

311
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:24,580
and you know they're all over the board

312
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:27,640
and I never played football at that age

313
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,250
but I played soccer and wherever the

314
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,730
ball was in soccer you had 12

315
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm sure not 11 our boasted 2222 players

316
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,950
there and it was always the challenge

317
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,449
keeping the goalie in the goal right and

318
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:46,630
so so anyway the question is what is the

319
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,480
best strategy this is one where you can

320
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,130
raise your hands who thinks in order to

321
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,390
be successful in winning football a

322
00:15:51,130 --> 00:16:00,280
passing strategy is your best strategy

323
00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:02,410
nobody ok what about running nobody so

324
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,220
all of you then think number three is

325
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,120
the best right

326
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:13,600
Pop Warner yeah yeah of course right no

327
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:15,610
actually what is the best yeah it's a

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,030
combination whatever the defense will

329
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,400
allow it depends right it depends on

330
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:27,730
really quite a lot of factors that go

331
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:29,770
into this okay and so did we need to

332
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,490
know you know what's the caliber of our

333
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,930
player okay a lot of people look at this

334
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,730
and they think Oh Charlie Brown who

335
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:42,400
missed the ball again well what about

336
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:44,410
that one guy super talented you never

337
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,949
want them to receive the snap of the

338
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,350
ball on a field goal kick yeah they're

339
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,030
just going to drop the ball you know

340
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:57,270
super talented but that's not their game

341
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,699
okay don't put them in that position

342
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,800
maybe you look at the other team and you

343
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:08,290
think that's who we're going to play

344
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:11,230
today ok anybody a Patriots fan yeah

345
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,339
anybody Dolphins fan I'm sorry if you're

346
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,750
a Dolphins this year ok if you look

347
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,929
there they're both in the AFC they're in

348
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,380
the same thing group so the Patriots

349
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:27,189
currently are 7 and know the Dolphins

350
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,290
currently are Owen 7 they've met one

351
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:36,130
time so far this year anybody know what

352
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:37,540
the score was 43 to 0 ok the dolphins

353
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,670
and the Patriots are supposed to meet

354
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,620
again on December 29th and if less

355
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,490
there's a big shift what do you think

356
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,178
the Dolphins are going to look at

357
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:53,929
right you know so sometimes you're just

358
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:56,510
up against really bad odds weather

359
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:58,070
conditions football is really hard in

360
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,309
the rain football is really hard in the

361
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,049
snow doesn't even necessary coming down

362
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:06,320
right now but if it's really muddy it's

363
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:08,960
pretty terrible you know but do you

364
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,750
think that the fans of the team really

365
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,880
care about the weather on whether or not

366
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:19,309
the team does well or not no they want

367
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:21,289
the team to win of course if you have

368
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,870
really bad conditions and there's not

369
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:27,110
much anybody can do so this is actually

370
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,549
Boston this is them this is actually

371
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,639
number two on their list you can see

372
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:34,549
there's a little little footnote there

373
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,419
this is number two on the biggest

374
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:41,870
snowstorms in Boston history this is a

375
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:45,529
February of 1978 and there was twenty

376
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,739
7.21 inches of snow in a 24 hour period

377
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,809
and so but this is number two number

378
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:56,140
number one was twenty seven point six

379
00:18:50,809 --> 00:19:00,678
inches but what about conditions like

380
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:04,159
does the team have any injuries okay so

381
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,799
I was having to tape up my foot and so

382
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,500
my son here of course had to have his

383
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,250
foot taped as well and so that way he

384
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,730
can be like dad but it's sometimes begs

385
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,649
the question does the team have real

386
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,000
injuries or are they faking their

387
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:25,010
injuries you know and depends on on you

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,450
know the person of course but you got to

389
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:31,070
wonder sometimes but if you if we

390
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,980
translate from football into

391
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,570
cybersecurity okay and we take a look at

392
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,190
some of the basics you know what caliber

393
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,799
player do you have on the field well

394
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,659
what are the skill sets are the people

395
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,210
of that of that analyst that you have on

396
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:47,570
your team what is the strength of their

397
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:52,070
team or the capabilities of the attacker

398
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:55,090
what tools do they have what are the

399
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,090
weather conditions like

400
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,810
current threat landscape okay are there

401
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,240
any injuries do we have any technical

402
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,940
injuries any vulnerabilities what about

403
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,830
the people injuries are they properly

404
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,930
trained okay in cybersecurity in

405
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,810
developing I'm going to go through a few

406
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:18,490
steps just to kind of a suggestion of

407
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,800
something something that you can do to

408
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,960
kind of help stabilize and maybe point

409
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,430
the ship in the right direction but one

410
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,980
of the first things you really have to

411
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,920
do is you have to designate some sense

412
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,680
of a framework now that framework may be

413
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,780
imposed on you there may come from some

414
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,400
laws or regulations there may be some

415
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,070
industry standards kind of like PCI

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,080
where they say this is what you shall do

417
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,480
here you go

418
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,679
but if you're not one of those he got a

419
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,520
pic one what about the NIST

420
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,520
cybersecurity framework CIS controls

421
00:20:50,550 --> 00:21:00,730
toeb it's just talked about PCI oops I'm

422
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,200
sorry can you get me my well let me get

423
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:09,610
it real fast I know where yes okay so

424
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,680
the thing about the the frameworks is

425
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,729
that you have to pick something that is

426
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,160
going to work for you right okay if it's

427
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,500
if it's outlined for you that's great

428
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,640
but if it's not you got to pick

429
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,570
something you got to get started

430
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,890
somewhere

431
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:30,310
and so in picking your framework it

432
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,920
really if you're new to the game and you

433
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,050
really don't have anything in place pick

434
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,540
something it really doesn't matter just

435
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:41,919
get started get some kind of bearing

436
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:44,280
picket move forward ISO ISO is really

437
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,410
great if you have to go cross you know

438
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,840
you know country boundaries ISO is a

439
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,240
great certification because it's

440
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,260
recognized all around the world okay but

441
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,300
pick something okay you can actually

442
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,560
even if you'd like to you you can kind

443
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,970
of pick a little bit from here a little

444
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,190
bit from there there are some really

445
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,460
great things like you know at the Board

446
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,070
of Education I'm using the NIST

447
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,960
cybersecurity framework as

448
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:17,129
main structure but I'm looking at CIS

449
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,830
and I'm looking at PCI and I'm pulling

450
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:22,740
from from a couple of things from those

451
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,990
to kind of help shore up the the

452
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,750
cybersecurity framework and to help give

453
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,320
me some prioritization and some some

454
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,520
focus but once you get your framework in

455
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,899
place you've got to develop your

456
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,700
policies okay

457
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:40,800
clearly stated expectations your policy

458
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,230
should not be filled with a lot of words

459
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,440
make it as short and succinct as

460
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,420
possible of what you expect the

461
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,620
environment to be like what you expect

462
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:54,180
your users to do to not do etc needs to

463
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,020
be comprehensive meaning that you have

464
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:01,170
to cover as wide a girth of bases as you

465
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,350
can to be able to cover your whole

466
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,750
organization and your policies need to

467
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,659
be well-defined hey now you may say oh

468
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,920
wait wait you know clearly stated and

469
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,770
well defined that's the same thing right

470
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,970
no clearly stated is thou shalt do this

471
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:20,520
thou shalt not do that well defined

472
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:24,780
defines what this and that is you know

473
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:28,740
you shall have management of your assets

474
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:32,100
for the full lifecycle of the asset well

475
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,320
what's an asset okay that's welded well

476
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,959
defined is where you go in and create an

477
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,909
asset so what you can do is you have to

478
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,820
take a look at your organization if you

479
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,910
do not have a whole lot of sensitive

480
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,909
information
