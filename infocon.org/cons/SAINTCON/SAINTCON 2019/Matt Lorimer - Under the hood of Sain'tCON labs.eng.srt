1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,460
you told me to wait alright alright so

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,809
anyway I whose flight is it anyways this

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,970
today and I'm making slides for that and

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:19,320
so this slide deck has content but it

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,180
doesn't have anything entertaining your

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,070
fun in it it's like boring words on

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,170
white so I'm gonna rip through these

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,380
slide deck quick because what you really

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,670
care about is the demo to show you how

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,439
it really works under the hood and what

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,439
what's happening on the hypervisor so

12
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,089
just to make sure you're all in the

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,419
right spot

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,469
this talk is under 13 con labs before we

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,210
get started how many people are actually

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,289
playing with the labs have been in there

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,489
this year has it been overall a good

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,410
experience and worked how you expected

19
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:56,690
the machines are provisioning and blah

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,578
blah blah alright that's good to hear

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,649
so a little background the sink on Labs

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,210
I love the hackers challenge that Josh

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,799
does I think it's fantastic but I always

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,298
complain that it's just a little bit too

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,820
theoretical there's nothing really that

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,010
works I mean it there's nothing that I

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,110
use at work that comes out of the

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,939
hackers challenge because I don't do

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,439
crypto my daily job I don't do reverse

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,830
engineering of my day-to-day job I don't

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,279
do a lot of those things and so in

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,780
talking about it somebody the rather

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,240
than complain why don't you fix it came

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,759
up and so came up with the idea of

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,240
simulating a pin test I guess before I

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,880
get this I should start and just say

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,899
background this is who I am I don't know

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,339
how many guys have been in my

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,040
presentations before but I recognize

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,560
several faces so I'll go quick

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm Matt Lorimer I work at USU up in

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,409
Logan I go by zodiac on comms and other

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,210
things I'd rather wait I'll be out

44
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,200
riding my bike right now but sadly I

45
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,329
can't be so I'm in here and I do have a

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,110
soft spot for ice cream of pretty much

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,489
any kind and donuts in hot chocolate are

48
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,860
also nice so I ride my bike more I do

49
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,900
red teaming for day job before a day job

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,110
I do Systems Administrator

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,010
and security incident response and kind

52
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,950
of a opera sock type of role but I do

53
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,950
help with the red team for various

54
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,480
events are various within the higher

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,790
education system in Utah I helped with

56
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,250
the red team that participates on audits

57
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,709
there I've been on snake hunt committee

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,379
for more years than I remember and

59
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:42,359
probably should admit to if we I help

60
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,500
Pope start Pope came up with the idea

61
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,329
and here you know I got together and

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,609
pushed and started ADC four three five

63
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,859
group if you're ever in Logan you should

64
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:51,420
totally come to it if you're in the rest

65
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,079
of the state that has four three five is

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,548
your zip code or is your area code

67
00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:01,019
you're welcome to stop sorry Sean you're

68
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,700
welcome to start your own little

69
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,379
offshoot and do your own groups will

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,250
share the DC four three five name with

71
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,608
you maybe again I worked at USU that's

72
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,819
me

73
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,829
is anyway the labs are like I say there

74
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,540
wasn't a lot for my day-to-day job in

75
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,310
the hackers challenge and it's fun to

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,750
play and it's cool and you learn but I

77
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,489
didn't learn anything that I could take

78
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,220
back and to work and say this is what I

79
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,930
did and this is how it applies to work

80
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,379
so I kind of felt guilty going down the

81
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,970
rabbit hole of hackers challenge and not

82
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,230
coming back with anything actionable at

83
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,590
work for a conference they were paying

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,619
for so the idea of the saint con labs

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,040
came up and basically the labs are a

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,669
simulated pen test we go in and you get

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,989
put into an environment and you can

88
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:49,049
compromise remote systems we give you a

89
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,690
Kali Linux box and that Kali Linux box

90
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,790
has a management interface and a

91
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,709
attacking interface and if it's on the

92
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,679
attacking interface you can attack it

93
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,030
and try to compromise it if it's on the

94
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,669
management interface probably don't

95
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,319
touch it so if you have not yet played

96
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,560
with it but you want to you still have a

97
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,440
little about a day if you go to hackers

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,000
challenge org there are two game boards

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,639
this year the uber boards and the sink

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,709
on Labs board the labs board one of the

101
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,989
challenges is get your credentials I

102
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,889
think it's called something like that if

103
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,060
you go there they'll give you

104
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,140
credentials to login to these labs

105
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,750
once you get in the labs you'll get your

106
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:36,840
Cali box this is just really quick again

107
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,330
I rather than spend all my time getting

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,299
pictures I'm gonna do a demo in just a

109
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,099
minute so roll with me as these don't

110
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
make sense the demos way more fun I'm

111
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,710
just trying to plow through the slides

112
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,300
quick to get it done but sum up is there

113
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,909
is a lab command once you get into the

114
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,380
box and that lab command will let you

115
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,030
provision various lab environments but

116
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,230
really this is part where I think about

117
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,169
like what should i why should I

118
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,440
participate really this is the in my

119
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,060
mind again it's actionable but it's

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,530
because you can grow and learn if you're

121
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,240
interested at all in any kind of pin

122
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,719
testing or growing into that type of

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,160
role or even if you are blue team ER and

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,650
you're gonna be blue team or for life if

125
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,920
your assist atman or whatever these labs

126
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,810
are the concepts and ideas or things

127
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,330
that I have actually seen or I've talked

128
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,740
to people who legitimate legitimately I

129
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,669
exploited pretty much everything in the

130
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,930
labs this year there is one exploit in

131
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,280
the labs that I have not seen in the

132
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,610
wild and it's just because it was a new

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,130
one and I was excited to use it but it's

134
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,040
not a very real-world real world but

135
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,420
pretty much everything in there is

136
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,920
something that if you walked into a

137
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,880
random environment you would find and

138
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,460
you would see and you could exploit

139
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,020
another thing I think that one of the

140
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,479
biggest points of the con in general is

141
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,010
to meet people if you don't know the guy

142
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,540
next to you you're probably doing it

143
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,480
wrong you should turn next to them and

144
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,450
say hi my name's Matt what's your name I

145
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,860
don't know you the whole point of Labs

146
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,710
is they're a little bit hard I hope that

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,390
you find people that are also working on

148
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,909
them and work on them together and learn

149
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,430
learn with each other

150
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,100
hackers challenge points there are

151
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,510
prizes for this board this is a little

152
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,430
bit easier of a board than the uber

153
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:27,810
board you don't get a black badge but

154
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,050
you do still get prizes and the prizes

155
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,890
are pretty cool prizes so I totally

156
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,020
would recommend people participate this

157
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,229
is real quick what powers the labs what

158
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,840
do we have the labs are actually

159
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,660
on site they mention I work at USU and

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,500
they are located back at USU living in

161
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:55,400
our data center basically we took some

162
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:58,010
old Dell PowerEdge servers if anybody

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,900
needs a pro curve SFP I don't know if

164
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,010
it's one gig or ten gig but I found it

165
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,010
on the podium I'll give it to you

166
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:12,500
varying vintages of PowerEdge servers

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,030
totaling 76 cores CPU cores 378 gigs of

168
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,060
ram and about 11 terabytes of hard drive

169
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,210
space we're actually not using near that

170
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,700
much hard drive space we're also not

171
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,120
using near that we're using less ram but

172
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,680
I thought we would and we're we are not

173
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,230
using a whole lot of CPU until we get to

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,460
the hash cat labs some random old

175
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,860
brocade switch we pulled out of the pile

176
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,789
and just the regular old USU internet

177
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,790
feed on the software side I went with

178
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,960
what I knew I can't come from

179
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,930
virtualization of storage background my

180
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,450
day job has been VMware virtualization

181
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:56,750
for years I did that I've been doing it

182
00:07:50,450 --> 00:08:02,659
for Oh like 13 years 14 years since like

183
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:05,420
ESX to point something so I'm pretty

184
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,370
familiar with that that's the hypervisor

185
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,590
handling everything we're using power

186
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,790
CLI for the automation we'll get the

187
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,090
automation there slide about that a

188
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,370
second for presenting the desktops we're

189
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:20,359
using tiger VNC with Apache guacamole

190
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,330
and then we're doing that because last

191
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,280
year we tried to do just regular RDP

192
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,250
installed on Kali and it turns out our

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,989
DP on Kali is super janky and it works

194
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,670
with Windows but doesn't work with Mac

195
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,760
or it works with Linux but doesn't work

196
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,349
with Windows and you can pretty much if

197
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,270
you got Windows Mac and Linux you can

198
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,430
choose to and get those two to work with

199
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,569
the RDP count client in Kali but you

200
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,770
could never find a way to get I could

201
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,270
never find a way to get all three to

202
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,920
work so we decided to skip the RDP

203
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,060
directly and just go to guacamole and

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,599
have it be the same interface for

205
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,589
everybody

206
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,120
and

207
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:59,060
guacamole kind of sucks because it's

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,740
Java but it works so I don't care the

209
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,020
provisioning management is all custom

210
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,430
software that a lot of it was written by

211
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,480
me some it was written by old and coil

212
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,949
he's not here

213
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,450
he helped ton with these labs mostly as

214
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,220
we got close to the conference and I got

215
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,750
sucked into other things he picked up a

216
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,640
lot of my slack and finished a lot of

217
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,770
the projects that were needing to get

218
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,089
done

219
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,980
obviously Callie is there that's the

220
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,900
attack platform that your that's being

221
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,580
used and then there are various Windows

222
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,020
and Linux target systems that you're

223
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,020
that you're compromising and attacking

224
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,910
we currently have four nodes that are

225
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,279
working for ESXi hosts that are powering

226
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,949
all the labs and we are balancing the

227
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,839
load across there right now we have 200

228
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,779
labs provisioned and the way that the

229
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,880
provisioning scripts work is a lab one

230
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,430
goes on node one lab two goes on look no

231
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,050
two three four five six seven eight like

232
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,000
we just bounced between those four nodes

233
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,000
and increment up for all all the labs

234
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,710
there's actually no shared storage

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,550
because I didn't have a spare old san

236
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:06,170
sitting around not doing anything and so

237
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:10,130
we went the cheap route and also don't

238
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,439
have v10 licenses so we everything's

239
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,300
done with linked clones because it's a

240
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,700
thousand times faster to clone the VM

241
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,910
but also because that way it doesn't use

242
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,010
up too much storage and so because of

243
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,900
that we had to have a master on every

244
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,430
single all four of the ESXi hosts so

245
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,870
every every there's a Kali master and

246
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:35,120
every VM that's in the labs that you're

247
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:41,510
attacking has a also has a master or a

248
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,040
full clone on each of the hosts there's

249
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,330
a couple of different processes we do

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,370
I'm gonna show you a demo we're just

251
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,520
gonna do this in a second but even idea

252
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,310
what's going on we can reset the Kali

253
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,959
box or reset individual lab which blows

254
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,939
away the entire lab environment just

255
00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:00,709
gives you a clean fresh cally box with

256
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,839
no other labs provisioned there's a labs

257
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,280
provisioning script which will destroy

258
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,360
whatever labs you currently have

259
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,339
provisioned

260
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,110
than provision whatever lab you

261
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:16,579
requested right now the labs that exist

262
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,839
sheep rock from Cass County school

263
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:23,930
district created lab one that is a he's

264
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,519
back in the back raising his hand that

265
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,219
one's pretty cool because it shows you

266
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,959
how to leverage a little when if you

267
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,490
ever run into out-of-date systems and

268
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,099
things that need to be updated and

269
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,320
patched there are some configuration

270
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,209
things errors in there as well that you

271
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,600
have to exploit and you leverage to get

272
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:44,410
a full access to the box and sounds

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,670
pretty cool Eldon built up a lot of the

274
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,740
Linux to lab which is fully patched

275
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,959
fully up to date Windows boxes but

276
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,649
pretty much just all configuration

277
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:02,060
issues leveraging lazy sysadmin work

278
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:04,339
leveraging a lot of times for us what it

279
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,920
happens being is at because I work at a

280
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:10,670
at a university departmental hire a

281
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,219
student who does great for a student but

282
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,839
considering the types of attackers and

283
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,329
the skill of attackers they're just not

284
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,040
up to what they need to be and so when

285
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,079
you have subpar sis admin work you get

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,219
these systems exploited so that's what

287
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:28,279
Linux - is recon is one that Scottie

288
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,959
built and it's basically ways that you

289
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,800
can get data out of services that are

290
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,689
exposed to serve - in general there's

291
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,719
DNS in Active Directory and various

292
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:42,079
things that we all expose in all of our

293
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:47,480
environments sorry - active DNS and

294
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:50,060
directory services and it's just systems

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,519
that are exposed in normal day-to-day

296
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,380
business life and how do you get data

297
00:12:52,519 --> 00:13:00,949
out of these systems is what that recon

298
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:03,199
is the 81 lab EHR Allen from us you

299
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,529
built that one it's a Windows box in a

300
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:09,560
Linux box it again is fully up to date

301
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:13,279
Windows 10 fully patched Server 2019

302
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,439
fully patched and mostly exploiting

303
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,580
configuration errors within

304
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,140
orlie setup environment not that these

305
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,730
people aren't bad at setting up

306
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,439
environments they purposely did it wrong

307
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,440
it's not I'm not saying that they're bad

308
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,140
next year I've already got some goals

309
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,870
I'm starting to map stuff out

310
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,090
I want labs working before day two of

311
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,800
the con I'm sorry if you were trying to

312
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,950
play on Tuesday it took us a little bit

313
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,079
to get things rolling I think they were

314
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,470
up Tuesday afternoon but it was not as

315
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,300
soon as we wanted them to be I want to

316
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,370
get more lab environments it was cool

317
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,969
this year to have four I'd love to have

318
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,290
10 or 12 if there's anyone in here that

319
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,760
would like to build one you know

320
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,339
somebody wants to build one whatever

321
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,650
please please please please talk to me

322
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,360
if you don't want to build one but you

323
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,620
have ideas on what the exploit past

324
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,000
should be please please tell me that too

325
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,530
if you have any sort of feedback on how

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,340
to improve these we want to hear these

327
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,990
from you if you build in a lab

328
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,520
environment or if you give an exploit

329
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,110
path or something like that that does

330
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,850
not exclude you from the game you can

331
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,540
still totally play you can get points

332
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,700
for the challenges that you create if

333
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,520
you create a lot of content then you

334
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,770
probably can't play like if you make six

335
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:35,030
out of the 12 lab or six out of 12 labs

336
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:38,180
then no I don't want you to use half of

337
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:40,010
it as work you did but really if you're

338
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,020
just gonna make one or two it's totally

339
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,590
fine we'd love to have you contribute

340
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,180
and play I want more capacity we're

341
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,480
actually not using as much as I thought

342
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,300
we were this year there's as much as we

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,590
thought we would this year but I would

344
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,969
like to have more capacity so that we

345
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,400
can get more people playing more people

346
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,710
talking about it and using more of the

347
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,829
capacity that's there that's the more

348
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,870
active users probably need wheat well

349
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,670
not probably I know I need two more to

350
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,040
monitor the environment and get alerts

351
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,189
and notifications of how we're doing as

352
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,260
far as right now we have 200 labs

353
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,839
provisioned and so if you go grab

354
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,950
credentials from the hackers challenge

355
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,960
you're gonna get dumped into one of

356
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,520
those 200 labs and it would be nice to

357
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,960
be alerted when the pools running

358
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,960
shallow and almost empty and stuff

359
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,250
one of my personal goals is to shift to

360
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:36,730
a new hypervisor and new hypervisor ties

361
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,040
in with an ex - first off I'm not a

362
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,420
coder at all I'm we're gonna do the demo

363
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,130
on a second and you'll see that my code

364
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,569
is pretty ugly it's really a hack but

365
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,400
it's a hack that works so I'm not too

366
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,780
stressed but it would be nice to get

367
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,760
better code that's a little bit more

368
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,360
stable and can handle some other failure

369
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,360
paths and then with the new hypervisor

370
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,970
part of that I'd like to get something

371
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,590
probably KVM based so that we could make

372
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,350
this just an open source platform that

373
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,930
anybody could check out the code run KVM

374
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,820
and have their own lab environment that

375
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,500
does what they can provision whatever

376
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:20,710
labs they want all right that's enough

377
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:22,270
terrible slides this is the environment

378
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,160
that we've got going on right now

379
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,990
anybody have any questions before we get

380
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:32,050
don't jump into like what's really going

381
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:33,340
on how it works all right so you'll see

382
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,859
in here this is the environment we've

383
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,690
got there are four hosts and the way

384
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,650
we've laid it out as there is a folder

385
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,140
for everything one of the labs and then

386
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,560
down here we've got the Masters and like

387
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,610
I said you'll notice that there is a

388
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,290
master and by the way if you're doing

389
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,790
the labs is giving you a little bit more

390
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,439
information than you need it because you

391
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:58,870
now know what machines are in each of

392
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:03,400
the labs this is your clue I'm saving

393
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:09,430
you an nmap scan you'll see that there's

394
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:12,040
it's like this 81 lab on the - 64 ESX

395
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,540
host there are there's a master image

396
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,849
for both of those like we were saying

397
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:25,170
before but really the cool part is when

398
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:27,790
we get in here this is inside of the

399
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,950
this is the guacamole box but all right

400
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,510
sorry this is my local box that I have a

401
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,920
lot of provisioning scripts and I'm VP

402
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,530
and into that environment so we can show

403
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,090
what's going on but I'm going to make

404
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,460
this actually a little bit smaller so

405
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,330
that you can watch VMware while I'm

406
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,470
running script

407
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:49,990
doing things you can see what's

408
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:51,669
happening these scripts have gone

409
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,289
through various things that started with

410
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,470
like 20 scripts and then we use three or

411
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,470
four

412
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,910
okay this is the guacamole box which is

413
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:29,630
actually the orchestration box were

414
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:32,150
using and we've got some scripts to kind

415
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,430
of simplify the way that things work

416
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,050
we've been blowing away the script or

417
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,760
the environment occasionally just to

418
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,530
start fresh

419
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,120
is that like also I didn't mention him

420
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,190
my slides but he did a lot to contribute

421
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,830
he updated the game board for us we give

422
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,330
him a CSV of credentials he ingest that

423
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:55,250
he can give it assign those out to

424
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:57,230
people but I can come in here and I can

425
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,030
say with this provisioning script I can

426
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,460
say I want a provision lab one through

427
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,990
ten and then if you'll watch over here

428
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,680
on the tasks inside of E Center you can

429
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,850
see that this would just go through and

430
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,430
first thing it does is it looks at

431
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,379
what's there looks at the sees that

432
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,540
there is currently a cally box there so

433
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,060
there's other things blows away the

434
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,860
existing environment powers off the VM

435
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,230
which it's funny that it takes longer to

436
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,090
power the VM off than it takes to create

437
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:31,310
a new one and delete the old one both

438
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:36,429
combined but it goes through it'll power

439
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,429
off the VMS let me come back at this

440
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,820
you'll see it right here you'll watch

441
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,549
this Kelly four will go away and then

442
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:55,178
come back shortly thereafter I guess

443
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:56,830
we're on too so I can go three one

444
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,510
through ten by the way are not in use I

445
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:08,379
verified that I'm not killing someone's

446
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:12,000
lab all those are going for a second I'm

447
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,000
going to log in to this next

448
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,669
all right here you should see level

449
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,470
three it powered off it got deleted

450
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:30,020
provisioned a brand new one and then I

451
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:39,320
power the new went on move on to lab

452
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:41,500
four and we're not keep going don't do

453
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,500
that

454
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,100
so this is the lab one environment I'm

455
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,150
going into right now this is actually

456
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,740
the callee box

457
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:59,850
have you guys all seen the the guacamole

458
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,850
interface for logging in

459
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,580
you can all now login to lab one if

460
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,760
you're quick and pay attention and grab

461
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,760
that

462
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,249
so the way this works is it provisions

463
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:55,070
the VM and then after it's provisioned

464
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:56,749
the VM runs a post install script one of

465
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,820
the steps of the post install script is

466
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,379
to randomly generate the password after

467
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,509
it's randomly generated the password it

468
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:04,488
writes it to a file to be sent out to

469
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,320
the game board and also to be consumed

470
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:11,749
by guacamole so that guacamole has the

471
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,119
same password as the Cali box and so I'm

472
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:22,099
just grabbing the level one password out

473
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:24,379
of this master password file and the way

474
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:30,349
it works is it takes the last password

475
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:32,859
in the list because obviously as we

476
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,330
reprovision these over and over again

477
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:37,639
you saw it lab will win exist a couple

478
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:43,099
times you've got a B and C and an SSH

479
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:44,149
option to connect to these this should

480
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,639
look familiar for anyone who's been

481
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:52,699
participating in the labs I was going to

482
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:54,639
come over here and have you watch I'm

483
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:00,399
going to fire off the command to

484
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:04,879
reprovision Linux lab - what this does

485
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:08,059
if you look lab it's just in your user

486
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:13,099
local bad bin lab it's actually a

487
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:15,999
symlink I think yeah it's a sim link to

488
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,999
this lab pi

489
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,600
which is pretty straightforward and

490
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,800
simple here all it does is it says here

491
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,879
are the labs here are the descriptions

492
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:37,680
this is what we've got verifies that you

493
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:42,150
chose a valid option and then it'll come

494
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,680
in here and it SSH is - if various

495
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,210
options if you do - I'll show you what

496
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,380
you're currently connected to stuff but

497
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:51,630
the actual provisioning is it runs an

498
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,320
SSH is to the guacamole the

499
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,780
orchestration book box and gives out a

500
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,889
lab name by the way the guacamole box is

501
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,120
out of scope please don't break it I

502
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,470
told you it's janky and a little bit

503
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,090
fragile and I'd rather not have to

504
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:14,340
figure out how you broke it because I'm

505
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:17,370
sure you could and then I can show you a

506
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,490
little bit about what that does on the

507
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,689
guacamole box right in just a minute so

508
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,580
that's literally all it does and then

509
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:33,140
the guacamole box fires off a script for

510
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:35,460
you so if I fire off this Linux to lab

511
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,220
over here it just says requesting lab

512
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,030
for for there but if you look over here

513
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,950
it's cloning this Linux client 265 Linux

514
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,899
client 65 now that we've got that we

515
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,260
edit some settings to put it in the

516
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,580
right networks of the lab - environment

517
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,490
once that's done we move on to the

518
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,189
server and you're in there and everybody

519
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,020
has their very own Linux - server box

520
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:02,540
everyone has their very own Linux one

521
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:06,180
box you cannot break anyone up well you

522
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,180
shouldn't break anyone else's box or now

523
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,760
or set a lab environment and it will be

524
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,500
difficult for you but you might be able

525
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,129
to we've tried to isolate them as much

526
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,130
as possible

527
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,140
I don't know why that didn't show there

528
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,470
you go

529
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,200
so you see it provision those two Linux

530
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:37,210
boxes there if I come back over to the

531
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,220
guacamole there's a VNC session blow

532
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,710
that away and do Linux one you can watch

533
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,940
and it'll first destroys the environment

534
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:48,520
and then provisions a brand new one

535
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:51,309
exactly like it I'm rolling through this

536
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,120
quick we're gonna get out early I hope

537
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,370
you're ok with that

538
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,919
that's for who sleds in anyways don't

539
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:02,229
mind that sorry wrong tab so back over

540
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,350
here to the guacamole server the way

541
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,720
that that works is this provisioning

542
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:12,070
user there's a provisioning user on here

543
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:23,320
with SSH keys that allow all of the lab

544
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:24,520
environments to SSH in now I'm really

545
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,960
telling you guys what you need to know

546
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:32,010
in order to pony so again please don't

547
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,590
you'll see that we allow we're using

548
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:41,080
some of the SSH options to restrict what

549
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:44,470
people can do so from 1:30 10.30 dot 1.2

550
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,210
50 which is lab environment to 50 you

551
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,780
can run user local been provisioning

552
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:54,970
about PI lab to 50 you can only run that

553
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,590
command with that option you can't run

554
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,030
that command with someone else's and so

555
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,120
it it should make things work pretty

556
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,120
well

557
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,530
this provisioning pie is a pretty

558
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:13,210
straightforward thing it creates a log

559
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:16,010
file make sure you're requesting a right

560
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,640
the right lab environment or I guess an

561
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,710
approved lab environment and the big kit

562
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,500
is it runs PowerShell if you guys

563
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:28,790
anybody in here run power CLI and VMware

564
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:32,240
I went in with low expectations because

565
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,649
Microsoft and PowerShell and I turns out

566
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,350
I actually kind of like PowerShell

567
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,030
because the way I describe it is I write

568
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,820
scripts I don't write programs this

569
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:43,550
object audience stuff sucks I just do

570
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,090
like janky scripts that start at the

571
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:50,330
beginning and finish at the end and

572
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,699
power CLI fits my skill set nicely it

573
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,110
actually does some things very nicely

574
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,920
PowerShell does some cool passing of

575
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,919
objects and whatnot

576
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,929
so the the provisioning script the

577
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,110
Python is doing a lot of data

578
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:10,340
standardization of sterilization which

579
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,469
honestly is my if it's Python Elden

580
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,500
wrote it if it's PowerShell I wrote it

581
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:18,080
and so he wraps my stuff to make sure

582
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,370
that there's no easy way to hack through

583
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:25,480
it and exploit it because he is a good

584
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,479
programmer I'm not

585
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,550
[Music]

586
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:48,719
oh that's stupid let's run this so I can

587
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,720
get some pretty colors in here with it

588
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,840
I'll make this bigger look at that

589
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:02,290
so the deploying lab will come in here

590
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:08,680
and you'll notice it's really pretty

591
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:10,960
straightforward and easy all that I'm

592
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,520
doing again validating the lab

593
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
environment making sure we have the

594
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:22,389
right things make sure we connect to the

595
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:23,740
V Center make sure that we there's a

596
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:29,020
hidden environment that you could just

597
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:31,270
figure out so we come through here and

598
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,580
they it just does exactly what we showed

599
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,690
to clean it up and then we deploy it but

600
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,949
you'll notice one of the things we have

601
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,460
to do is we have to come in here and

602
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,750
change every single network card after

603
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,610
we provision it to put you in your

604
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,120
island and and isolates you from the

605
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:49,209
others and like none of these are really

606
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,919
huge in depth crazy things I know a

607
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,470
couple people asked me if they can set

608
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,730
it up and use it for their like inulin

609
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,520
lab whilst try and get what do they

610
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:00,640
setup for them I'm happy to help with

611
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,170
that and do that with you and by that I

612
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:09,280
mean I'll give you the code and answer

613
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:11,500
questions but so that that largely is

614
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,220
the extent of how these work and how

615
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,090
they isolate as far as networking you'll

616
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,250
see that to isolate we had to make

617
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,320
different networks for every single lab

618
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,840
environment we just separate them out on

619
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,129
their own VLAN because these are all

620
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,810
because of the way we have to do it

621
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,240
without shared storage everything lives

622
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,500
on one ESX host so these don't have to

623
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,340
hit the switch these don't have to do

624
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:40,420
anything they just live within VMware

625
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:43,389
this lab 1a only talks to lab 1a on that

626
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:46,200
hosting I don't it exists on all three

627
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,430
hosts but it's not right there it's not

628
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,059
tagged up through the sweat through the

629
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,679
uplink port

630
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:57,759
and the switch doesn't have any of these

631
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:59,200
VLANs configured kind of plowed through

632
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,549
that because I'm tired of looking at

633
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,879
this because I've been up till 3 in the

634
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:02,440
morning

635
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:05,230
almost every day this week trying to

636
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,549
make it work more so what parts do you

637
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,559
have questions on or what do you guys

638
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,408
think about this what are your comments

639
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,668
questions thoughts what else do you want

640
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,940
to know about the labs and what they're

641
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:14,940
doing

642
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:30,989
I have thought about that but I'm at

643
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,360
work we're replacing 32 ESXi hosts in

644
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:37,500
two months and so I have free or

645
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:42,000
expensive so I'm gonna go with the free

646
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,320
option I it totally would work and like

647
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,200
I said while we're looking to move

648
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,340
hypervisors next year anyways it would

649
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,920
be great time to do it

650
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:56,520
it just is a matter of because of the

651
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,860
way things work at USU bandwidth this is

652
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,650
essentially unlimited we have 40 gigs of

653
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,840
throughput up and down and like our

654
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,290
internet link is connection is 40 gigs

655
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,939
and power is generated through the steam

656
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:15,000
plant they generate run the turbine and

657
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:17,760
generate power so powers free it doesn't

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,500
cost us you anything and it doesn't cost

659
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:26,400
the you testing organization anything

660
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,660
it's hard to argue with free but yeah it

661
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:37,560
would be cool to go there too

662
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:38,670
I didn't say it my first slide but I

663
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,230
should have started with I'm not that

664
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:48,870
smart I have played with docker a tiny

665
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:51,210
bit and I can do a little bit and I

666
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,310
would love to get there where some of

667
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,710
this is based on that but it's a

668
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,540
learning curve and if someone else wants

669
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,690
to help me learn or help build some of

670
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:04,200
this I'd love to get there I'm just not

671
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,500
I went with what I do there's no reason

672
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,500
we couldn't

673
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,160
any other thoughts or comments is

674
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:19,340
anybody willing to help next year create

675
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,450
environments please please please don't

676
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,929
leave this room until you've talked to

677
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:26,600
me because I am dead serious I I would

678
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,130
love to have if I could do 20 or 30

679
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,110
different labs that you can get then I

680
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:37,640
would put 20 or 30 labs that you could

681
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:39,830
choose from on there they will still

682
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,570
exist some of the capacity has to go

683
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,689
over to other project but they'll still

684
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,220
exist and I'll use these like for DC 4 3

685
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,850
5 we've got an event a month or so that

686
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm gonna go through these on but if you

687
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,840
would like access to these and you want

688
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,550
to play with them after the con and you

689
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,970
reach out to me I can make sure that we

690
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,680
get you credentials and just instead of

691
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,270
having 200 labs provisioned we'll

692
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,880
probably only have 80 or 90 laps

693
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:10,969
provisioned but I'm totally happy to

694
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:13,370
let's play with one of those so anyway I

695
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,639
plowed through it quick and I'm like 25

696
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,650
minutes short but that I just mostly had

697
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,879
a lot of people ask me what was driving

698
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,350
this what was powering and that's the

699
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,480
point of this talk is to give you an

700
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:27,199
idea of what's powering and how they how

701
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,960
they function so anyway that's all I've

702
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,250
got unless you have more questions

703
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,320
thanks for coming I hope you guys really

704
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,750
are learning is everybody learning and

705
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,429
having fun with the labs those of you

706
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:42,679
that are doing it is it worthwhile and

707
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:44,240
educational okay I'm glad and that I

708
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,480
hearing that makes me want to do more

709
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,069
and so let's please give us feedback and

710
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,449
let's make it better so next year you

711
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,450
can learn even more than this year

712
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:14,620
yeah last year Misha is back there I

713
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,060
think did he leave okay me she was back

714
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,930
there he helped me with the labs last

715
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,310
year and it was one of those things

716
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,500
where I got the idea and thought do we

717
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,620
have enough time and we literally threw

718
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:41,890
it together at the end and he it was it

719
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:44,560
was a little bit bumpy yeah yeah it was

720
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,970
really rough and hopefully that we can

721
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,500
make continued to make progress in

722
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,939
laughs this years way better than last

723
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,420
year and I want next year to step it up

724
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,720
even more so let's let's keep doing this

725
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,730
because I I said I love the idea I'm

726
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,649
passionate about the concept of giving

727
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,520
you real-world experience things that

728
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:10,900
you might actually do whether that's red

729
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:12,759
team or blue team but yeah I I've done

730
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,380
I've pushed about as far as I can push

731
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,880
with my skill set so it's time for me to

732
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,240
go a little bit but also to reach out

733
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,580
and try and get some more help so yeah

734
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,990
all right that's all I've got if there's

735
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,900
no more questions if you want to come

736
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,970
find me I'll be around like said I

737
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,620
highly recommend whose side is it

738
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,270
anyways those slides got the pretty

739
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,609
pictures and not this slide deck so

740
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,259
sorry this was pretty boring white and

741
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,500
black but I hope you got something out

742
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,500
of it
