00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
there is Andy Brandt and he happened to

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,490
make it a special request I am

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,700

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,019
coke he wanted for fried chickens but I

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,239
just gotten a plate full of for fried

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,610
chicken

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,530
working with this guy and we want saint

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,460
khan's come around thank you

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,699
[Applause]

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,279
so this is the this is my fifth year

14
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,940
attending st. con and fifth times

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,780
speaking so I'm really happy to be back

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,000
for those of you who are sitting like

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,920
way in the back there there's little

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,140
tiny stuff that I'm gonna be showing

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,020
that's up here on the table and it might

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,640
be hard for you to see so I you know

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,230
realized that some of you already gotten

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,670
comfortable but if you can come up

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,919
closer if you really want to see that

24
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,930
stuff that would be great

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,210
so I'm Andrew Brandt I'm the I'm a

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,219
principal researcher at Sophos and I'm

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,449
the editor of the sofas labs on cut blog

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:07,470
and in between working on running a lab

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,390
in which i detonate malware for for you

30
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,700
know modern normal malware on real

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,979
machines I volunteer at a place of that

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,140
has old computers and I wanted to talk a

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,780
little bit about the work that I do with

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,610
that group but before I jump into that I

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,880
wanted to mention that this is a Wow

36
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:32,340
sorry this is an interactive this is an

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,979
interactive session so I welcome and

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,560
encourage you all to just interrupt me

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,170
if you have questions in the middle if

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,220
you do ask a good question

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,130
I have presence so I have music CDs I

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,399
have stickers from the mail and for the

43
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,770
very best questions I have actual 1980s

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,790
viruses on floppy disk that you can take

45
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,140
home with you so I am also not an expert

46
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,040
in any of this stuff I want to just

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,740
caveat the entire talk in that I am

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,680
virtually you know I'm essentially just

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,019
a ringleader here not the lion tamer not

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,900
the like expert on all of this stuff and

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,980
that this is you know purely just ways

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,840
that I figured out

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,879
how to do some of this stuff it is not

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,610
necessarily the best way or the only way

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,450
to do it right so a little bit of

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,580
history this week actually this coming

57
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,640
week is going to be the 50th anniversary

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,340
of the first message ever being sent

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,170
over the what was before the Internet it

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,799
was called the ARPANET and it was sent

61
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,649
from it was sent from UCLA and I believe

62
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,790
it was to the University of Utah and the

63
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,440
so that's a picture of some of the guys

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,170
in the lab at UCLA because they're

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,019
celebrating this this milestone next

66
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,480
week and the first message was just

67
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,030
those two letters ello and does anyone

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,828
know why has anyone heard this story

69
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,959
before and do you know why the first

70
00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:04,709
message was ello okay it was because

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,549
they were trying to type log in and it

72
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:11,609
crashed after two bites so you could say

73
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:14,129
that the internet started with a denial

74
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,430
of service attack and you know it only

75
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:20,010
went downhill from there

76
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,410
34 years ago computers were becoming

77
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,989
fashionable accessories and you even had

78
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,780
people like Andy Warhol and Debbie Harry

79
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,880
from blondie being pulled out of you

80
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,180
know the dustbin and trying to use to be

81
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,959
you know promoting computers as creative

82
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,090
tools for artists and this was I created

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,250
this slide because I gave a talk about

84
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,599
this stuff a couple weeks ago at Virus

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,450
Bulletin it was being held at a

86
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,660
conference center at the Hammersmith

87
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,638
novotel hotel is the same hotel where

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,889
this computer was introduced now this

89
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,810
was a terrible you know it was a

90
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,980
star-studded event and they spent a ton

91
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,389
of money on it

92
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,500
but the computer was very poorly

93
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,379
received it was considered to be

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,840
exorbitant ly expensive nearly $1,500

95
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,810
and it didn't sell well and commodore

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,010
didn't last much longer

97
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,049
so I mentioned I've been doing some

98
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,069
volunteer work and this is the the place

99
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,030
where I do the volunteer work there is a

100
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,250
lab at the University of Colorado

101
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,279
Boulder called the media archaeology lab

102
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,890
and it's a it's actually set up by a

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,799
literature professor who was doing her

104
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,009
graduate thesis on

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,729
or her PhD thesis on electronically

106
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:34,460
mediated entertainment and storytelling

107
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,530
and she discovered that as she was

108
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,049
collecting more and more examples of

109
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,750
this stuff that she had to maintain an

110
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,090
increasingly large number of functional

111
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,330
computers and other devices in order to

112
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,119
read the media that the the games the

113
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:53,150
poems the stories were written on and

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,030
and that became this media archeology

115
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,739
lab but the craft or the the study of

116
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,130
media archeology is actually a serious

117
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,680
academic pursuit and it does require

118
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,949
necessarily not only maintaining the

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,750
software but the hardware to play it so

120
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,160
the lab is where we do that and this is

121
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,389
a just a picture of the front room in

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,220
the lab and you can see it's basically

123
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,949
arranged in a kind of a rectangle and

124
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,289
it's the computers are in the room

125
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,300
roughly oldest to newest in a certain

126
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:25,880
chronological order and on one side is

127
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:28,610
all X or I guess it's PowerPC Macs and

128
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,520
on the other side is the other older and

129
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,580
newer computers as well but we also have

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,070
a lot of entertainment technology so

131
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,530
record players and 8-track players and

132
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,900
you know even a giant Edison gramophone

133
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,119
that has no power but when you play a

134
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,130
record on it it just absolutely is like

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,110
the loudest thing you ever heard and

136
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,630
it's kind of hard to imagine that this

137
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,099
thing that's made of brass and wood can

138
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,259
make something that's that loud but it

139
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:55,789
works great and everything is maintained

140
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,610
in working order so people can just come

141
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,310
in and use them for the purposes of this

142
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,690
project I used essentially three

143
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,159
different platforms because I'm looking

144
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,820
at three different pieces of malware

145
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:11,210
that predate Windows by quite a lot and

146
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:14,630
in some cases predated das and maybe not

147
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,120
all das but ms-dos although Microsoft

148
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,710
was writing the DOS and some of the

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,599
basic interpreters for some of these

150
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,549
really old computers in fact if you look

151
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:27,880
at you know even the trs-80 model 3

152
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,680
which came out in I want to say 79 or 80

153
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,440
that it it was one of these computers

154
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:40,340
that use Microsoft basic as its main

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:44,690
thing right so these three machines the

156
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,638
Apple 2 the Commodore 64 and the VAX so

157
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,880
it was really hard to bring a VAX

158
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,830
machine here I don't actually have one

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,159
what I discovered is that it was much

160
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,919
easier to kind of create a simulated VAX

161
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,570
machine in this little box that I've got

162
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,409
here on the table which is called a PI

163
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:06,050
DP 11 but these are basically the three

164
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:07,669
platforms that I used and as I mentioned

165
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,490
these most of this malware predates

166
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:13,370
ms-dos and windows the platforms that

167
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,770
they're on are obsolete most of it won't

168
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,349
work on anything that you have in your

169
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,270
house so why do we need to study this

170
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:21,650
stuff right these are the three pieces

171
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,859
of malware that I'm gonna be talking

172
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,710
about today the elk cloner BHP virus and

173
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,979
the Morris worm I'll tell you why this

174
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,870
is really important every it's and as I

175
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,909
was doing this work I had no idea of

176
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,039
what to expect and how you know I was

177
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,830
learning as I was going what these

178
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,310
things do and what I discovered is that

179
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,229
in studying all of these old you know

180
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,969
ancient viruses I mean the the elk

181
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:52,750
cloner is is over 35 years old they

182
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,550
exhibit many of the same behavioral

183
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,099
characteristics and use some of the same

184
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,630
techniques and tricks that modern

185
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,520
malware do they are they're essentially

186
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,979
the missing link in the malware chain

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,589
and it is the more you look at it the

188
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,130
more you realize how much of new stuff

189
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:12,409
is basically based on this ancient stuff

190
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,099
so let's start I'll talk about the elk

191
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:18,229
cloner first it was one of the earliest

192
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:19,789
malware I say one of the earliest a lot

193
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,639
of people call it the earliest malware

194
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,409
the problem is is there's probably stuff

195
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,659
that we don't know about that never got

196
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,669
released or that wasn't as violent but

197
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,968
it's definitely one of the oldest if not

198
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:40,010
the oldest the way that it worked is

199
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:43,640
that when you ran it it would be on a

200
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,980
disk with some games and the games would

201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,100
have been infected and trigger elk

202
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,769
cloner to load elk cloner would load

203
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,839
itself into memory

204
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,699
and then the way that it worked with

205
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,179
most people who had Apple to computers

206
00:08:54,699 --> 00:09:00,758
is you would have like a DOS it's called

207
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:03,069
dos 3.3 boot disk you would pop that in

208
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,129
boot the computer pop that out put in

209
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:07,748
your game play it pop that out put in a

210
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,519
different game do whatever you needed to

211
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:12,399
do so that basically the operating

212
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,259
system kind of was memory resident and

213
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,779
and not dependent on the disk being in

214
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,299
the machine all the time so the malware

215
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,980
was also memory resident and it would

216
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:24,429
write itself into the boot sector of the

217
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,379
floppy so that every 50th time that you

218
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:29,290
started up the computer it would play a

219
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,269
message and and the message is here you

220
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,738
can see it in the source code I'll just

221
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,920
read it because it's just such a fun

222
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:38,439
little poem it says elk cloner the

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,238
program with a personality it will get

224
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,170
on all your discs it will infiltrate

225
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:43,720
your chips

226
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,628
yes it's cloner it will stick to you

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,110
like glue it will modify ram to send in

228
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,699
the cloner so the guy who wrote this is

229
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,189
actually still around his name is

230
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,939
richards Grenda and the source is on his

231
00:09:54,189 --> 00:10:00,129
website so it was really easy to find

232
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:02,889
but like most of the people who I spoke

233
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:08,439
to about the malware that I studied in

234
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:09,790
this in this discussion the the creators

235
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:11,259
didn't really want to talk about it and

236
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,329
they kind of distanced themselves from

237
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:16,269
it now screen toe doesn't he's not

238
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,248
ashamed of it but he hasn't been

239
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,230
particularly forthcoming and basically

240
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:21,730
just wants to put it behind him and that

241
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,230
that was sort of my experience with

242
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,809
everyone else that I spoke to as well

243
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,600
about all the malware but so the trick

244
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,219
is to get this thing to work

245
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
we had Apple 2 computers which was easy

246
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,470
because we have a whole set of different

247
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,189
ones we have a it's a hardware and

248
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,490
software combination gizmo called an ADT

249
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:44,589
pro so ADT Pro is the software and there

250
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,399
and there's a client that runs in Java

251
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:51,549
on modern Windows or Mac PCs and there

252
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,589
is also a network adapter that's plugged

253
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:56,169
into the back of the device and so what

254
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,509
ADT Pro does is it allows you to have a

255
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,369
modern computer and move files back and

256
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:02,919
forth from a modern computer onto the

257
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,500
Apple 2 and even write to floppy or you

258
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,069
know load

259
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,360
things from the modern computer directly

260
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,000
onto the machine as though it were the

261
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,520
floppy we also used a couple of

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,180
different Apple 2 compilers and a

263
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,699
copying program called copy 2 plus so I

264
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,560
mentioned that the the site where

265
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,310
Scranton's got his stuff is it's right

266
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,290
there

267
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,959
it's all the source code it's not the

268
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:31,069
object code and the like a lot of early

269
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,350
malware is written in assembler so it's

270
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,090
not a basic program it is it is

271
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,660
something that is much harder to get a

272
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:41,420
hold of and to get it into is

273
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,189
essentially an executable format it's

274
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,449
really a pain in the butt so how did we

275
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,070
do it

276
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:51,770
we had to use ADT Pro to move it on to

277
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:54,610
the from you know download it on a

278
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,470
regular machine moved it onto a floppy

279
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,920
copied the compiler program onto another

280
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,860
floppy used a dual floppy drive Apple 2

281
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,560
to basically boot off of one compiled on

282
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,630
the other and then try to you know grab

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,880
that compiled code back off of those

284
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,920
floppies using ADT Pro so we had a copy

285
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,990
on a modern machine so we could do

286
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,959
things like uploaded to virustotal

287
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,060
and I just wanted to point out so the

288
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,470
this particular machine came out in 1982

289
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,479
that I'm sorry the malware came out in

290
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:32,870
1982 tcp/ip as a protocol was finalized

291
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,680
and became official on january 1st 1983

292
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,780
so it was it predated the internet but

293
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,479
the this cool little thing about ADT

294
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,040
pros the software lets you connect it to

295
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,950
the network so this is the only time

296
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,380
that you can actually see TCP I set up a

297
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,230
window on an apple - I just I think

298
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,200
that's cool so we ran into a lot of

299
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,780
problems with compiling the elk cloner

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,060
so it doesn't run on certain newer

301
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,860
systems we have Apple to leave and we

302
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,290
have an original Apple to a later

303
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,140
version Apple to Apple to see apple 2e

304
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,180
and it kind of crashed out on the

305
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,100
emulators and it didn't really like the

306
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,849
newer computers like the 2 E and the to

307
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,800
see we used two different compilers so

308
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,360
at first we were using a compiler called

309
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,209
Merlin

310
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,769
and Merlin was throwing all kinds of

311
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,119
errors it was it looked like it was

312
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,769
compiling but then when we try to

313
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,329
execute it it would kind of fail and we

314
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,300
couldn't figure out what's going on and

315
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:30,519
then finally screen to reply to a DM

316
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,229
that I sent him on Twitter and we had a

317
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,610
little bit of an email exchange and he

318
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,160
told me to use this other compiler

319
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,370
called Big Mac which I've downloaded but

320
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,189
we have not yet compiled it with Big Mac

321
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,720
we also did you can also take source

322
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,810
code like this that's an assembler and

323
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,899
you can paste it directly into memory

324
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,420
areas and and then just execute it that

325
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,700
area where you can do that is called the

326
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,130
monitor and you basically go into

327
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,230
monitor mode and you can insert the the

328
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,570
assembler directly into memory and then

329
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,380
hit G and it should run but we didn't

330
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,579
have any luck with most of those things

331
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,860
actually my experience of working with

332
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,719
Apple 2 systems is that I hate produce

333
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,700
which was their operating system and I

334
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,380
never want to have to do it if I can

335
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,970
help it ever again and I don't know

336
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,220
whether I'm Mothra or because that

337
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,779
Godzilla in this picture but this is my

338
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,790
experience of working with Apple twos

339
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,660
and trying to get stuff on and off of

340
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,000
them the benefit is is that on the

341
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,750
original Apple 2 we were able to compile

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,300
a version of the the 1.0 elk cloner and

343
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,070
we did get it to execute one time and

344
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,870
then it corrupted the disk that it was

345
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,000
on and it would never run again and we

346
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,850
could never repeat it so we're still

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,060
working towards getting a you know

348
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,920
properly replicable sample of the ELCA

349
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,810
loaner that we can then put up on

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,189
virustotal but at least you know for now

351
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,140
you can see like and what it does is it

352
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,470
just basically says l cloner 1.0 is now

353
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,430
resident in flashes the 2.0 is the one

354
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:03,940
that's that displays the poem I was

355
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,339
talking to some folks at as I mentioned

356
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,190
I gave this talk at Virus Bulletin a

357
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,620
couple weeks ago and one of the longtime

358
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,320
people who had been pretty active in

359
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,430
virus at Virus Bulletin this guy named

360
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,949
Vesely bond chef who's a pretty well

361
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,520
known guy he's vest on security on

362
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:27,160
Twitter he told me hey by the way I have

363
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,689
a hole annotated source code like record

364
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,790
of everything

365
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,800
from elk cloner and by the way like

366
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,990
there's all these function calls that

367
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,790
no-one's ever sort of disclosed before

368
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,579
and that we're never been you know

369
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,040
nobody's ever like tried to use as far

370
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,569
as I know and he sent me his annotated

371
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,290
source code so this is you know there's

372
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:48,878
two pages here and it has things like

373
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,099
you know there's error messages

374
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,019
there's ability to ring you know sound

375
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,689
making devices that are on the computer

376
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,939
there's also calls that can you know

377
00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:00,730
reset the counter that goes to 50 before

378
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:03,370
it runs and a bunch of other stuff and

379
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,410
so once we get this thing running I'm

380
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,269
very interested to sort of fuzz the elk

381
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,560
cloner and see what are all these other

382
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,529
functions that it can do and see if we

383
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,719
can trigger all of them so elk cloner

384
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,519
bhp was an interesting one and it was a

385
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,269
challenge for a completely different

386
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,459
reason that had nothing to do with my

387
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:28,230
inability to use the computer so I have

388
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:31,089
I was a Commodore 64 owner as a as a kid

389
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,459
and I have a lot of experience with

390
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:36,250
using it and one of the volunteer gigs

391
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,290
that I have at the at the MAL is that I

392
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,459
teach people how to use the Commodore

393
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,980
and we have a bunch of different

394
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,529
software that we that you can load on it

395
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,029
and for a variety of different reasons

396
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:49,089
different educators come and do

397
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,680
residency's and that's what we we do is

398
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,649
we teach them and sometimes they teach

399
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,089
us on how to use some of these machines

400
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:58,829
the beach piece is interesting because

401
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:03,790
the hardware for the Commodore is unique

402
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:05,530
it is a also a memory resident virus

403
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,619
that writes itself into the boot sector

404
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,480
of floppy disks but it has some really

405
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,770
interesting pioneering features and we

406
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,220
think about the fact that this was like

407
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,129
1986 when this stuff was happening this

408
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,939
was basically the malware equivalent of

409
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,140
cavemen carving a car out of stones with

410
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,809
whatever they could find on the ground

411
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,760
and they so they had all these anti

412
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,158
analysis and anti debugging features

413
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,169
that prevented you from sort of tapping

414
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:35,350
into the memory address space where it

415
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,240
was loaded they it off you skated itself

416
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,980
is it was all in assembler and there

417
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,360
weren't even any nice strings that you

418
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,430
could use like there was in the elk

419
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,760
cloner to see the poem

420
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:48,730
and and the coolest thing about it is so

421
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,030
the Commodore hardware especially its

422
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,560
1541 floppy disk drive is really is

423
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,180
really a unique piece of hardware in

424
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,070
that it's not just a floppy drive but it

425
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,630
actually contains a bunch of RAM and a

426
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,970
bunch of processing power so it actually

427
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,500
can offload a lot of the tasks that

428
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,900
would normally have been done by the

429
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,070
computer and the reason that Commodore

430
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,310
designed it that way is that they

431
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,409
assumed probably rightly so in the time

432
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,899
that they wanted to be able to just

433
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,910
shunt as much data into the the floppy

434
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,440
drive and let it do most of the heavy

435
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,150
lifting of reading and writing off the

436
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
disk so that the computer would be free

437
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,450
to do other stuff and it was it was an

438
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,630
interesting experiment but what the bhp

439
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,100
authors decided to do was that they took

440
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,630
advantage of the fact that there was

441
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,250
that memory that was in a separate

442
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,080
peripheral but connected to the machine

443
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,330
and they loaded themselves into the

444
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,520
floppy drive memory so that even if you

445
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,669
wanted to power cycle the computer to

446
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,560
get rid of the virus you could not get

447
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,970
rid of it unless you power cycled the

448
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,450
floppy drive as well so it was pretty

449
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:52,030
devious and sneaky

450
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,340
so to reproduce bhp was actually much

451
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,660
easier again I have a lot of experience

452
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,280
with the Commodore we have all the

453
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,740
devices there

454
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,260
I used this tool which is called a zoom

455
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,110
floppy zoom floppy is essentially an

456
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,750
interface between the Commodore floppy

457
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,500
disk and a USB port on a modern computer

458
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,450
and using some software I was able to

459
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,210
read and write floppies pretty easily

460
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,280
with with this thing and I have been you

461
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,130
know continuing to do that the malware

462
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,760
itself is available through a Commodore

463
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,100
software archive the main one that I've

464
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,140
been using for most of the project that

465
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,149
I have been doing here is this thing

466
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,830
called the Commodore 64 scene database

467
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:38,620
or CSD Bek and that's the the URL where

468
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,590
you can find it so it's you can get

469
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:45,280
basically the program there you then

470
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,800
have to use some tools to turn it into a

471
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,139
disk image and then write that disk

472
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,899
image to a floppy so the way that it

473
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,510
works is you use this tool called der

474
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,790
master it basically take that

475
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,650
program the Commodore 64 program that

476
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,780
you downloaded and it basically writes

477
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,170
it to a creates on-the-fly of virtual

478
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,670
floppy disk the virtual floppy disks are

479
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,510
usually a hundred and seventy one K in

480
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:14,920
size the the malware is about like two K

481
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:17,410
in size and so you write this too with

482
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:21,970
dura master create the disk and then use

483
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:24,280
the other tools with this CBM for win so

484
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,700
CBM Commodore Business Machines was was

485
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,700
their protocol that they use and there's

486
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,160
CBM for win and then there's GUI for CBM

487
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,930
for win because I hate using command

488
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,390
line stuff so I like to drag and drop

489
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,900
things and so I used this old GUI that

490
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,370
someone had written and you write out

491
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,630
the program onto the thing and when it

492
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,979
runs it is supposed to look like this

493
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:52,930
what I found is that there's a couple of

494
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,520
interesting caveats with that so it does

495
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,440
have a better chance of running on

496
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,389
physical hardware than on an emulator

497
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,280
although you can get it to trigger and

498
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,210
on emulator which I'm going to try to do

499
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,830
in a minute the Commodore has a clock

500
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,800
built in but it doesn't have a battery

501
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,360
so basically the clock starts at zero as

502
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,790
soon as you turn the machine on and it

503
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,620
just starts counting up from there if

504
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,960
the seconds on the clock end in two or

505
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,600
four when you launch the malware it will

506
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,770
trigger so it's basically if the roll of

507
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,290
the dice it's about a one in five chance

508
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,060
in a given time you're gonna trigger it

509
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,649
to two in fact

510
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,899
and technically it's not destructive but

511
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,100
it does overwrite parts of the disk and

512
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,840
occasionally you know if you've got a

513
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,629
lot of stuff on a floppy it might just

514
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,250
you know trim off the end of the

515
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,060
directory which means you lose the

516
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:43,470
ability to run your program so with that

517
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:46,419
I'm going to bring up the commodore

518
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,520
emulator it's called vice and i've

519
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,590
already loaded the directory for this

520
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,090
floppy virtual floppy disk that i've got

521
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,830
here it's on drive 8 and so this file is

522
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,510
called bhp virus so the way that you

523
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,939
load programs on the Commodore is you

524
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,000
just type load quote the program name

525
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:11,390
quote comma eight

526
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,410
now the way that it works is the malware

527
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:18,650
loads most of the content of the malware

528
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,500
is in memory but there is a basic

529
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:24,110
component basically a hook in basic that

530
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,290
allows you to trigger it and when you

531
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,139
execute that hook in basic it goes into

532
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,110
memory reads the Q no the instructions

533
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,330
in the command set in memory then that

534
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,719
part of that command set rewrites the

535
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,490
basic code that is that is in memory for

536
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,160
where the user has access to it and

537
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,370
changes it and it only after that has

538
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,990
happened does the malware trigger itself

539
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,780
or will it trigger itself so I'll show

540
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,420
you this is the this is the basic code

541
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,980
of the malware that just all it does is

542
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:00,110
say go to this obfuscated memory address

543
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:03,860
obfuscated if you can't do math and then

544
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:07,189
run this thing called virus so we hit

545
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,310
run and we get this error this is fatal

546
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,020
error in you computer yeah it's it's

547
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,850
suspicious right and when we look when

548
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,620
we list that program all of a sudden we

549
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,800
realize that it's changed that one line

550
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,290
of code to this print statement so this

551
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,629
means that the malware is now resident

552
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,840
but it has not actually triggered the

553
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,670
way that you trigger it is to try to

554
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,649
load the directory off of the disk a

555
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,410
second time and this is the part that's

556
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,910
tricky so if it doesn't work I apologize

557
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:40,460
in advance you saw the picture it does

558
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:42,260
pretty rainbow stuff right so it didn't

559
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,370
trigger but the good news about the

560
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,690
Commodore is that you can just move the

561
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:50,830
cursor back up to the command line and

562
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:56,600
just do it again and again and again and

563
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:59,720
at some point it should if I'm lucky it

564
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,899
will trigger remember it's a roll of the

565
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,900
dice

566
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:10,139
did it there it goes all right

567
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:14,009
and it's so that's the entirety of the

568
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:16,289
virus right it says dr. strobe doctor

569
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:18,899
dr. strobe and Papa hacker was here Co

570
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:23,460
programmer Garfield hallow dhikr Shen

571
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:25,228
dice is ein echter virus I don't speak

572
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,749
German but like there's a bunch of

573
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:31,259
people at VB who did and they basically

574
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:35,220
said this says hello fatty this is a

575
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:37,019
real virus and that's it and at this

576
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,570
point now that floppy will be infected

577
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:44,220
and it will have like placed that bit of

578
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:45,689
code into ROM on the around into RAM on

579
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,519
the floppy disk and then if I were to

580
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,749
take that floppy disk out and swap it

581
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,669
with another one

582
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:55,710
it would infect that there is actually

583
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:58,379
also by the way a a malware remover that

584
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,379
basically goes through and scrapes the

585
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:02,820
floppy drive looking for pieces of the

586
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:06,509
code so even though they used

587
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,119
obfuscation in the code they had chosen

588
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:10,470
they gave it this instruction set that

589
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,449
allowed it to pick a different random

590
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,399
memory address every time it was loaded

591
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,929
and then they failed to actually use

592
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,609
that instruction they just jumped over

593
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:21,299
it so it always loads in the same place

594
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:23,099
so most of the bhp cleaners basically

595
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,720
just go to that address look to see if

596
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,970
there's something there and wipe it out

597
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:33,059
so so that's it

598
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:34,379
bhp right the Morris worm all right

599
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,559
everybody's talking about this one

600
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:39,299
because it's kind of a big deal I'm sure

601
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,940
everyone in this room knows about the

602
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,799
Morris worm but if you don't or if

603
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,840
you're not all that familiar with the

604
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,700
story I have a little video that I

605
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,209
wanted to play to kind of bring you up

606
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:58,820
to speed and hopefully it will actually

607
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:58,820
play it doesn't look like it's doing it

608
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:10,179
all right we turn the sound up life in

609
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,490
the modern world has a new anxiety these

610
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,260
days just as we've become totally

611
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,350
dependent on our computers they're being

612
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,020
stalked by saboteurs saboteurs who

613
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,000
create computer viruses the Defense

614
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,950
Department universities and research

615
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,960
centers are still recovering tonight

616
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,900
from a computer virus that brought a

617
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,690
nationwide network to a standstill one

618
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,899
of the institutions hardest hit was MIT

619
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:37,510
David Bowie reports it was first spotted

620
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:38,379
at NASA Ames and Rand it came from

621
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,500
California

622
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,110
maybe traveled by electronic mail it's

623
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,590
spread across America how insidious was

624
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,529
his virus well it was it spread very

625
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,689
quickly there are reports in newspapers

626
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:55,659
today that it has made its way to Europe

627
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,460
and to Australia it arrived at MIT in

628
00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:00,880
the middle of the night the students

629
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,159
were safe that computers weren't just

630
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,630
ran it would enter your machine it would

631
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,990
do its thing it would go to other

632
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:10,390
machines at MIT 200 computers were

633
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,610
infected across the country the toll

634
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,590
might be 6,000 it could have been worse

635
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,629
he believed it was intended to spread

636
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,428
more slowly than it did so that it

637
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,779
wouldn't be noticed as quickly which

638
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,299
would actually have been more insidious

639
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,539
if it's spread out to a large number of

640
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:28,570
machines and say held a surprise and did

641
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:31,210
something Mark Eiken student and

642
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,389
part-time virus hunter once we had it

643
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,059
stopped we were able to take it apart

644
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,010
sort of like dissect it and tear it

645
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,178
apart piece by piece these three

646
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,770
processes right here these three

647
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:44,230
programs the SH with the friends around

648
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,360
them are in fact copies of the virus

649
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,059
that are running there it's not really a

650
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,459
virus it's a code a set of instructions

651
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,428
an act of sabotage that started on a

652
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,649
floppy disk this virus spreads by disk

653
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:59,140
and by telephone it's just to call away

654
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:07,120
and like a virus it replicates like

655
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:09,340
crazy and as it replicates the code the

656
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,330
so called virus eats up large amounts of

657
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:15,720
memory it wipes out stored data or

658
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:18,300
cripples the hardware this virus clogged

659
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,120
his system making thousands of computers

660
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,159
but apparently did no damage it's benign

661
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,620
it's not malicious it attempts to do no

662
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,850
damage besides propagate itself and

663
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,889
that's why I think it's a warning

664
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:33,270
the suspect somewhere a dark genius I

665
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:36,450
suspect it's an A student a good a

666
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,670
student so lost computer time but no

667
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,840
files destroyed just a thrill for the

668
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:44,400
virus hunters my personal speculation is

669
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,000
that this is somebody who is trying to

670
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,270
to warn people to say it can happen to

671
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,980
you mister president

672
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,310
we have not even been able to isolate

673
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,720
the cause the virus if it is a virus

674
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,240
it's like the common cold it is

675
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,630
everywhere it just nowhere for the 10

676
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:08,700
o'clock news I'm David Bowie yeah so

677
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:11,340
there's a lot of themes in this news

678
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,220
story that you know feel very modern

679
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,459
like someone was trying to teach someone

680
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,170
a lesson about the vulnerability without

681
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,840
causing damage but trying to make a

682
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,420
point at the time that that news story

683
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,760
ran nobody knew that it would hit

684
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:31,740
originated in the lab of Robert Tappan

685
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:36,629
Morris Jr who was a student I believe at

686
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,210
Cornell if not MIT I can't remember but

687
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,990
yeah it happened almost 31 years ago to

688
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,810
the week and it it actually spread using

689
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:48,030
a number of different methods so it had

690
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,669
there was an exploit against the finger

691
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:53,100
daemon there was an exploit against send

692
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,530
mail and there was a brute-force attempt

693
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,639
against a bunch of different accounts on

694
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:02,460
the machine one of the things that was

695
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,860
crucial is that it was only able to

696
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,270
target machines that were running bsd

697
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,389
4.2 or 4.3 on the VAX 11 or Sun

698
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,910
workstations the Sun workstations were

699
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,920
able to get infected but they couldn't

700
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,770
spread the the malware so really the VAX

701
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,070
was the only platform that spread the

702
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:24,480
malware further after it got infected it

703
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,159
was it took advantage of an interesting

704
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,340
feature in that

705
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,960
version of bsd where if you had an

706
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,780
account on a machine and that machine

707
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,700
was trusted by another machine you could

708
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,889
log in without a password just using a

709
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,870
username on that second machine so that

710
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,270
there's basically this like transfer of

711
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,729
trust from machine a to machine B with

712
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,440
without using a password and so the

713
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,240
brute-force attempt was actually just a

714
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,460
bunch of usernames not even passwords

715
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,720
but it were you know some of the

716
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,760
usernames were people that were

717
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,060
obviously well known in the computer

718
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,070
industry at the time it what had an

719
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,770
ability to throttle itself so it was

720
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:04,169
only supposed to spread one out of every

721
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,320
seven attempts at trying to connect to a

722
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,820
remote machine but what Robert Morris

723
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,500
didn't realize is that that was nowhere

724
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:15,149
near restrictive enough a limit to kind

725
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,010
of keep it from going haywire and it

726
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,720
went completely ballistic and like they

727
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,850
said it kind of spread like wildfire

728
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,420
across what would have been the ARPANET

729
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:27,419
or the early internet in those days it

730
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,250
also had a hard-coded IP address which

731
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,230
it still exists in the source code today

732
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,690
and it points to a machine at UC

733
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,140
Berkeley which is of course offline at

734
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,300
this time and it disguises itself as a

735
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,610
copy of shell but it's this shell with

736
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,060
parentheses around it so take note of

737
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:47,790
that because that's actually relevant so

738
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,700
soon after the student after the worm

739
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,340
was was released and it took two or

740
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,110
three days of a lot of putting on people

741
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,610
putting a lot of heads together to do

742
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,590
incident response and figure out a

743
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,740
method and and the the incident response

744
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,659
methods were to either rename send mail

745
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,180
on on the infected machine so they

746
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,700
couldn't be reinfected or to patch send

747
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,700
mail to get rid of the vulnerability

748
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,980
that allowed it to be leveraged to send

749
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,290
out more copies of the worm the

750
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,480
technical report here it was written by

751
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,760
the professor Eugene Spafford and it's

752
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,430
actually a it's a great report and I

753
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,610
think it's probably the first example of

754
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:28,650
a like proper academically written

755
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,379
malware analysis paper and it is a

756
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:35,130
really interesting paper because it does

757
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,290
discuss how there was issues with the

758
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,200
incident responders and the people who

759
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,299
were at the sort of the heads of

760
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,549
this group of people that were tasked

761
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:46,679
with dealing with the worm decided

762
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,418
collectively that they would never

763
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,340
release the worm code to the public

764
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:53,190
because it was too dangerous and someone

765
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,259
might mimic what had been done and you

766
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,049
know relaunch it against other machines

767
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:59,879
and everyone knows what happens when you

768
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:03,600
keep things obscure it obviously keeps

769
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:06,178
them secure forever so to reproduce the

770
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,219
Morris worm has actually been the

771
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,009
biggest challenge so far so I am NOT a

772
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,129
I'm not really a Linux user not a Linux

773
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:14,519
guy not a BSD expert on in any sense of

774
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:16,369
the word

775
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,710
and certainly not an expert in

776
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:23,399
workstations so you need to have either

777
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:26,399
the VAX or the Sun you need to have the

778
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:28,590
BSD setup on it which was a very tedious

779
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,238
process involving something like 20

780
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,629
different floppy disks and loading them

781
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:36,749
onto a I think it was a 5 megabyte hard

782
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:38,428
drive that the thing used so in order to

783
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:40,049
do this properly and to be able to do

784
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:42,570
the kind of testing and repeating that I

785
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,879
needed to do I used an emulator called

786
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,210
sim H which emulates all these really

787
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:50,189
old workstations and mainframes there

788
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,609
are at least two different versions of

789
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,499
the source code that I found the by far

790
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:57,678
the most prevalent one that you can find

791
00:33:55,499 --> 00:34:00,599
on the web is this annotated version

792
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,869
that's that's on this area aldo

793
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,840
Martini's web site on github but then i

794
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:11,219
found just recently an unknown

795
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,929
in this other person's gitlab folder and

796
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,759
they called it tapeworm but it was

797
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:17,220
essentially they had they had reproduced

798
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,559
more swarm but they had removed all the

799
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,808
annotations and comments out of it all

800
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,720
those annotations and comments as far as

801
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:26,940
we know that they were they were added

802
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,339
afterwards by people who had done sort

803
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,679
of post hoc analysis on the worm and

804
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:33,418
they've done you know decompiling in

805
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,200
reverse engineering to create the source

806
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:39,000
code so even though I have to you know

807
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,158
sort of functional copies of the source

808
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,230
code as far as I know they're not real

809
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,960
because they have all these comments and

810
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:50,149
edits and notes about how the worm works

811
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,918
and what it does and I've had no luck in

812
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:53,190
asking people like gene Spafford and

813
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,168
that

814
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,970
mark iken who was in the video who I

815
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:58,650
contacted and a bunch of other people

816
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,089
all basically said oh well it's out

817
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,660
there floating around on the internet

818
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:05,910
somewhere no it isn't so as far as I can

819
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,290
tell I showed you at the beginning of

820
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,720
this section there was a screen that

821
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,880
showed a floppy disk from the Computer

822
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,589
History Museum in San Jose if that

823
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,450
floppy disk actually has the Morris worm

824
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,430
on it and it wasn't just copied from one

825
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,950
of these github repositories that may

826
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,319
actually be the source that I need and

827
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:25,770
I'll be reaching out to them soon to try

828
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,940
to get a copy but I needed hardware to

829
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,089
build it right and I wanted to do

830
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,270
something fun and honestly like Saint

831
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:34,770
Con this is your fault because last year

832
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,200
after building my badge and then

833
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,849
building about a hundred mini badges I

834
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,009
became kind of obsessed with doing

835
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,349
soldering projects and I signed up for a

836
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,750
subscription service called hacker boxes

837
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,910
and I started you know buy kits left and

838
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,190
right and now I'm just sort of

839
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,440
incorrigible and this was kind of like

840
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,900
my graduation present into sort of the

841
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,200
world of like big scale soldering so

842
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:01,609
this kid is called a PI DP 11 and even

843
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,990
though it is just a two-thirds scale

844
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:04,859
housing it is actually a functional

845
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,990
device but I'll show you some

846
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,700
screenshots of like it comes as a PCB

847
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:12,720
with all these parts you have to solder

848
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:14,220
in all these LEDs and at the end with it

849
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,040
comes with this nice housing and the

850
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,078
front plate and the switches in the end

851
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,970
you get this nice thing that boots up

852
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,440
and it can run a variety of different

853
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,910
operating systems and what's cool about

854
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,480
it and some of the some of the cool

855
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,569
things about it is that it has comes

856
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,060
built in with 14 different operating

857
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:35,069
systems available to you so again I'm

858
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,960
going to take a quick minute here and do

859
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:49,640
a demo using the PI DP so let me bring

860
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:53,190
up putty right so on the PI DP there is

861
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,890
currently two machines running there's

862
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,510
the sort of core operating system and

863
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,598
there's the version of the operating

864
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:03,240
system that's running that's running the

865
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,710
version of BSD with the worm on it and

866
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,500
that and you know it's basically ready

867
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,890
to be used

868
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,150
to control the the pidp there's like I

869
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,009
said there's all these switches here in

870
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,050
the front and there's these operating

871
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,720
systems that are listed on this screen

872
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,820
down here in the bottom left corner or

873
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,779
bottom right corner and for example if I

874
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,300
wanted to boot this thing into BSD 2.11

875
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:30,230
it says that the switch settings are Oh

876
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,650
102 and all of these so from this white

877
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:36,410
switch this way these are groups of 3

878
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:39,440
switches or octal switches so if I

879
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:42,319
wanted to start up number one zero one

880
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,360
zero two this would be the first zero

881
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,920
with all the switches down this is the

882
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:51,350
first one zero and then two it would be

883
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,630
not this one but this one and then you

884
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:59,259
pop this little button in and it should

885
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,260
if it's still connected

886
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:10,370
hopefully reboot but I'm not sure that

887
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:16,150
it's connected it's not connected these

888
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:21,740
things happen all right so it is now

889
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:23,450
starting to boot bsd 2.1 and what's

890
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,490
great about this thing is it's not just

891
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,859
pretty lights it actually does have the

892
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,410
ability to be used in it's sort of

893
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,120
normal way each of these switches is

894
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,500
used to control memory address space so

895
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,810
you could load your program into a

896
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,640
specific memory address flip the switch

897
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,470
on when you want to run it and there's a

898
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,660
button here that's a start and it's

899
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,970
literally like using you know it's a

900
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,920
debugger so you hit start you can run

901
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,970
your program if you decide at some point

902
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,830
you want to pause it there's this

903
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,540
there's a halt button here and then you

904
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,370
can step through it with a mechanical

905
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,070
switch and so it it is actually kind of

906
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,509
a cool thing to be able to do

907
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,670
experimenting with this stuff and

908
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,920
there's this dial actually sets it to

909
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,810
use memory space that's used by the

910
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,260
kernel or memory space it's user space

911
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:08,480
or program space so it is actually kind

912
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,570
of a fun tool and when you when you boot

913
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,640
into bsd it starts in single user mode

914
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:16,010
which means it's in route control d

915
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,359
takes you into multi-user mode and then

916
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,650
you can log in as a you know with a

917
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,040
proper user account it's more

918
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:26,090
like the old BSD the way that it would

919
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,800
have been but so in addition to all of

920
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,910
those operating systems so there was not

921
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,010
a version of the vulnerable Morris worm

922
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:38,180
operating system on this device but I

923
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:40,100
met a guy who is by day he's a patent

924
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:44,000
attorney in Los Angeles and by night he

925
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:46,670
is a he's a PDP expert and and bsd guy

926
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,520
and I was really grateful to meet him

927
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,260
because he built me this version of UNIX

928
00:39:49,520 --> 00:40:03,950
that's basically vulnerable to the worm

929
00:39:51,260 --> 00:40:08,870
so let me login so when you log in it

930
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:12,529
always automatically jumps the it jumps

931
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,569
the the PI DP version of the operating

932
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:19,790
system to the main window so the second

933
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:24,230
window is actually the root of raspbian

934
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:25,940
the operating system on the PI so

935
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:32,740
there's a directory in here called 43

936
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:32,740
BSD and I think it was running already

937
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,990
yes it is alright I need to kill it and

938
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,990
then we can start it again

939
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:55,140
oh I stand corrected it's not running

940
00:40:47,760 --> 00:41:01,110
okay good so the command is sudo start

941
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:03,810
the VAX buta and i and it knows what the

942
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:07,560
boot denying i it knows to use the the

943
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:09,870
disk drive for the bsd build that's

944
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,190
running on here i'm sorry i had this

945
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,420
running a minute ago and it kind of

946
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:17,100
pooped out so we have to give it a

947
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,770
second to load but while it's doing that

948
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,380
and it does a little disk check at the

949
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:28,170
beginning we can talk a little bit about

950
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,360
the preparing it so it does have it has

951
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,220
to be configured to use Ethernet

952
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,510
Ethernet was part of the make up of

953
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,439
those things in those days there was no

954
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,170
Wi-Fi but there is a Wi-Fi file that you

955
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,020
can use so you can emulate Ethernet with

956
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,730
Wi-Fi if you want to one of the things

957
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,400
that I am trying to do with the Morris

958
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,140
worm is to use why I want to use wired

959
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,860
Ethernet because I'm trying to capture

960
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,830
pcap of the worm traffic when I spoke to

961
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:58,170
mark I can he suggested that analysts at

962
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:01,380
the time they had captured traffic with

963
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:03,090
TCP dump but there's no pcap of actual

964
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,360
Morris worm traffic so that's one of the

965
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:08,700
things I'd like to create and then

966
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,740
building the worm itself once you get

967
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,410
the worm source code in there and it's

968
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,600
very easy just FTP it into the directory

969
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,009
that you want but there's a lot of

970
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,279
things you have to configure so among

971
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:23,130
among other things there was a an error

972
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,140
in the source code for worm C which is

973
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:28,380
one of the files that controls how the

974
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,390
worm spreads and it had an include that

975
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,330
pointed at a path that was incorrect so

976
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,890
you just lose the the slash at the

977
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,680
beginning of that path and it compiles

978
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,690
the other piece that was missing in the

979
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,029
source code that you can download but

980
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,960
that we added here are these five

981
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,760
defines that that sort of designate what

982
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,850
ports it's going to use for certain

983
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,240
behaviors right so we know that it was

984
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:57,029
using send mail to spread and the SD

985
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,850
SMTP server had to be defined here

986
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:02,100
it used finger D to spread and so the

987
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:03,870
finger port is defined here I'm not a

988
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,000
hundred percent sure what exact server

989
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,520
and telnet were used for by the worm

990
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,610
author but the command server two three

991
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,920
three five seven TCP that port was used

992
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,740
by the command and control server that

993
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,490
was at Berkeley it doesn't function

994
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:23,129
anymore and the code that would talk to

995
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:25,049
that part that machine on the Internet

996
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,600
all it does is send one packet to it and

997
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:30,350
it doesn't listen for a response so it's

998
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,120
kind of a pointless command control

999
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:34,770
setup but but it does it does need to be

1000
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:42,180
configured there in order for it to work

1001
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:49,160
alright so let's see if all right that's

1002
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,160
the other one all right

1003
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:11,149
all right so we are logged in and my

1004
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:12,739
source is in user local source and there

1005
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:16,970
are three directories in here I've got

1006
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:20,269
the the annotated the annotated and a

1007
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:22,839
leet version of the malware in here so

1008
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:25,819
we'll go to just the Morris worm

1009
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:31,549
directory and inside of the directory

1010
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:34,369
there's these these ten files right so

1011
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:35,509
building this is pretty simple you do

1012
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,640
have to have the obviously you have to

1013
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:40,880
have it on the machine you're gonna run

1014
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,890
it on to compile it but just make to run

1015
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,039
the the make file that's there in the

1016
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:48,170
root in that directory that builds most

1017
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:52,099
of the worm and what you get after you

1018
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:58,069
do make is an executable called test and

1019
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:59,509
just an elf and boom so it's done all

1020
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:01,819
right and there's our directory and you

1021
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:04,309
can see sort of 2/3 of the way down on

1022
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:06,019
the bottom there it says test with a

1023
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:08,359
start NS star next to it that's our

1024
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:10,609
executable but there is another

1025
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:12,499
component of the worm which is the

1026
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:15,859
actual warming component the piece that

1027
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:18,379
tries to spread using send mail and

1028
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:22,759
finger D and that's the file at the very

1029
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:25,339
bottom that's labeled X 8 1 1 3 5 5 OS

1030
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:28,730
dot C and that doesn't get compiled when

1031
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:31,880
you do this so you have to do a cc of

1032
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:33,710
that file now I made a duplicate of that

1033
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,650
file I made a copy of it into a file

1034
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:39,109
called L 1 C which is not part of the

1035
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,359
original it was not part of the archive

1036
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:44,839
that I downloaded but in the Stafford

1037
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,549
the Spafford paper he writes about the

1038
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,078
fact that there was basically this warm

1039
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:51,038
component that was compiled separately

1040
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,910
and it's referred to internally as L 1 C

1041
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:58,759
that was because the payload would

1042
00:45:54,910 --> 00:46:02,690
dynamically change its name so to boot

1043
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:07,519
this you just do l CC L 1 dot C and that

1044
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:08,000
builds a second program that is called a

1045
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,770
dot

1046
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,870
out which is now on the top there so

1047
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,660
there's now two two new files in

1048
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:17,839
addition to those dot o files for all of

1049
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:21,140
the dot C files there is a a dot out and

1050
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,450
test this is where it gets tricky

1051
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,200
because there's no instructions anywhere

1052
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,580
on how to run the malware so it took a

1053
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,189
lot of poking through the source code

1054
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:33,799
and trial and error to try to figure it

1055
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:38,900
out and for the most part I was not

1056
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:41,180
successful however this morning and oh

1057
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,400
yeah I had a little bit of an epiphany

1058
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:47,120
as I was preparing for the talk and I

1059
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,100
tried something different so as I

1060
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,589
mentioned this a dot out is the is the

1061
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,140
part that you run and that is the worm

1062
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,180
binary that's the executable it requires

1063
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,150
three arguments and the arguments have

1064
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,129
to be in this order after you know the

1065
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,690
program name the IP address that you're

1066
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,270
going to target as its first target

1067
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:07,700
what's going to try to connect to a port

1068
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,100
number which in the case of the worm can

1069
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:14,870
be you know 79 if you want to do finger

1070
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:16,940
D or 25 if it's SMTP and then a magic

1071
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,339
number and I was thinking about it and I

1072
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,540
couldn't figure out like you know we're

1073
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,680
myself and this other guy the patent

1074
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,720
attorney we were trying to figure out

1075
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,060
how do what's the magic number like how

1076
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,500
do you even do this and and finally it

1077
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,810
came to me this morning as I was working

1078
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:34,160
on this dammit they're magic numbers

1079
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:36,080
they're right there so so yeah then I

1080
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,359
looked and I'm like okay well I'll give

1081
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:43,750
that a try so let me show you what

1082
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:46,850
happens so the command is a dot out

1083
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:50,810
we'll just give it an IP on the same

1084
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:54,560
subnet that I'm on port 79 and then the

1085
00:47:50,810 --> 00:48:01,220
magic number there one of them is Oh X 0

1086
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:03,200
1 4 8 8 9 8 interesting thing about this

1087
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,959
tomorrow I'm giving a talk about a

1088
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,520
ransomware called mega cortex that we

1089
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,650
discovered the company I work for

1090
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,880
discovered it in May it hit a bunch of

1091
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,710
our customers we did a bunch of

1092
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,310
post-mortem on it and it got a lot of

1093
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:16,310
press

1094
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:18,680
it also requires essentially a password

1095
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,190
to be input into the command line

1096
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,299
otherwise you can't

1097
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:26,250
the malware and it just strikes me as

1098
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:27,900
really familiar to see this command line

1099
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,730
where you have to have this like met

1100
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,470
this magic number that's hard-coded into

1101
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:34,140
the binary that it won't run unless it

1102
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:37,348
has that and like it's the same damn

1103
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,150
thing so I'm gonna run this I'm sorry

1104
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:41,640
that the text is so small make the

1105
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:45,289
screen as big as I can but we run it it

1106
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:47,848
doesn't say anything but if you'd PS aux

1107
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:50,490
at the very bottom you can see here

1108
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,859
there's that aged a dot out in

1109
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,808
parentheses which is exactly what you

1110
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:56,640
saw on that screen shot from the guy in

1111
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:58,260
1988 when he was pointing at the screen

1112
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,779
and saying this is the copy of the worm

1113
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:04,710
what one of the behaviors that it does

1114
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:06,510
is that it will rename itself SH but it

1115
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,670
does it with the parentheses and you it

1116
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,260
it's essentially trying to make itself I

1117
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,630
mean it's it's essentially the same as a

1118
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,119
modern Windows malware renaming itself

1119
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:17,490
Explorer die DXE but with a 1 instead of

1120
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,920
an L and so it's just trying to like

1121
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:21,419
hide in the process list so that makes

1122
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,190
it harder for people to notice where it

1123
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,529
is but it was so noisy and created so

1124
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:27,000
much of a mess that it couldn't help new

1125
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,910
people couldn't help but notice that it

1126
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,710
was this one process that was basically

1127
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:33,660
consuming all the CPU cycles on the VAX

1128
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,910
and causing everybody's like jobs to

1129
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,038
crash and making everybody mad for about

1130
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:42,089
three or four days but yeah that's

1131
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:44,220
that's it I mean it it feels a little

1132
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:45,869
bit anticlimactic

1133
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,578
to say like we've just run the Morris

1134
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:49,049
worm for the first time in 34 years but

1135
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,970
we just ran the Morris worm for the

1136
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:56,509
first time in 34 years in this room and

1137
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:59,509
I'm pretty proud of that so very nice

1138
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,510
right

1139
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,390
so we're still trying to get that source

1140
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,090
code I mentioned I'm going to be

1141
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:09,879
reaching out to the Computer History

1142
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:13,600
Museum but if some of you know this

1143
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,880
person hexadecimal on Twitter she is a

1144
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,270
researcher works for another company but

1145
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,510
she also was a side project was trying

1146
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:25,240
to see if she could foil source code

1147
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:28,120
from the FBI so she filed this FOIA

1148
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:31,270
request with the FBI and just yesterday

1149
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,759
got her response that said that in

1150
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:37,300
response to her request for the Morris

1151
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,550
worm source code that the FBI is unable

1152
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,590
to identify records responsive to her

1153
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,930
requests so there so the FBI does not

1154
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:46,540
have a copy of the Morris worm at least

1155
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,250
in the way that Emily submitted her

1156
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,259
request but we'll we'll keep trying to

1157
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,330
find the original source code once I

1158
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,320
have something that I feel confident is

1159
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:57,370
the real deal I will I am going to

1160
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,250
upload it to virus still and we'll have

1161
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:03,220
a IOC list of like the world's oldest

1162
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,870
malware for everyone to share and that's

1163
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,209
pretty much the talk so I wanted to

1164
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:09,190
thank all these people who helped me do

1165
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:12,580
this stuff so Oscar vermeulen and chase

1166
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:15,040
Coviello Oscar makes this thing does it

1167
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:17,470
as like a project of love out of his

1168
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,290
home it's not even his day job chase

1169
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:23,439
Coviello is the patent attorney who

1170
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:25,060
built me the bsd i want to thank my

1171
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,680
colleagues at the media archaeology lab

1172
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,170
Lori Emerson who's our director and

1173
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,460
Libby and Chris who give me a lot of

1174
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,020
support and help me with some of this

1175
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,970
stuff and then all these other people

1176
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:37,330
who basically helped me hunt for source

1177
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:40,149
code along the way we're all very

1178
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:43,060
helpful in this regard so thank you and

1179
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,920
thank them because now we have the

1180
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:48,670
Morris worm and we can actually say it's

1181
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,470
not just apocryphal anymore so nobody

1182
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,420
interrupted with a question but we have

1183
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,250
a few minutes right I think we have a

1184
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,250
few minutes for questions so yeah

1185
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,230
Wow okay so if you've got ransomware on

1186
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,730
your computer on your mother-in-laws

1187
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,359
computer what's the first thing you

1188
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,800
should do well I mean I'm not going to

1189
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:13,150
speak to the relationship you have with

1190
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,670
your mother-in-law I'm sure that it's

1191
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:20,800
you know warm and you know welcoming I

1192
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:23,020
think it depends so usually by the time

1193
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,830
the ransomware makes itself known it has

1194
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:28,810
already done all its damage and the the

1195
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,790
only recourse at that point is to

1196
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:34,000
restore from a backup unless you feel

1197
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:36,550
like paying a criminal money which I

1198
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,980
don't recommend but it turns out that

1199
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,300
for businesses the FBI and some

1200
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,619
insurance companies actually do

1201
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,630
recommend it because it can be less

1202
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,300
expensive than the cost of remediation I

1203
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:54,850
just find that to be an offensive

1204
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:56,560
proposition yeah so there so there's a

1205
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:59,319
there's a group called no more ransom

1206
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,880
and there's also ID ransomware and they

1207
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,859
what they do is you can upload the

1208
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,540
ransom note there and they they kind of

1209
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:06,520
hash it and they will tell you what type

1210
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,320
of ransomware it is and if they know

1211
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,950
that there's some kind of a decoder for

1212
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,320
it

1213
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:13,629
they can point you to it but you know

1214
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:18,119
most likely you're kind of screwed and

1215
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:18,119
hopefully you just have good backups yes

1216
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:31,009
so the question is were there any legal

1217
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:36,649
or other repercussions to any of the

1218
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:42,699
virus authors so Robert Morris jr. was a

1219
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:46,429
professor at MIT and he has he had some

1220
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:49,579
law enforcement issues when the worm

1221
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:51,529
came out he was convicted of a computer

1222
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:53,719
crime I don't know I can't recall

1223
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:57,199
whether he served any time in prison but

1224
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:59,359
he is notoriously sensitive about the

1225
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,769
topic and I was speaking to there was

1226
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,529
someone who was at the conference here

1227
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:05,689
yesterday who said that she had Robert

1228
00:54:03,529 --> 00:54:07,640
Morris as a professor in university and

1229
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:09,529
he said on the first day of class you

1230
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,558
were not to ask me about the worm or you

1231
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:14,569
will fail so he's pretty sensitive about

1232
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,429
it and I can understand that having you

1233
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:19,029
know having had to have gone through all

1234
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:22,640
of that he must be very trouble but

1235
00:54:19,029 --> 00:54:25,039
Richards Granta is a successful software

1236
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,019
developer and it's not part of his daily

1237
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,449
life and he doesn't love to talk about

1238
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:31,249
it or anything but he's got it up on his

1239
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:34,069
website and he can you can go there and

1240
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:36,709
download the files and we don't know who

1241
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:38,299
the authors of the BHP virus were other

1242
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:40,609
than their handles but you know

1243
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:44,019
hopefully co programmer Garfield is

1244
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:49,869
somewhere you know enjoying a lasagne

1245
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:49,868
yeah either yeah

1246
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,589
oh okay the question is do we know any

1247
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:01,029
of the motives of these things so with

1248
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,140
the Morris worm we do know the motive

1249
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,980
because he had gone through a whole

1250
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:07,779
court trial and Morris's motive for

1251
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,310
releasing the worm was that he had

1252
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,910
identified this vulnerability and

1253
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:15,040
sendmail and had tried to convince

1254
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:17,230
Berkeley software to updates and mail

1255
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,420
and they refused to acknowledge the fact

1256
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,150
that this vulnerability was serious so

1257
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:24,490
he literally like you know released it

1258
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,079
to the world as a worm to sort of prove

1259
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,779
a point that this is that this is a

1260
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:32,349
dangerous bug and then you know ended up

1261
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:36,130
breaking computer crime laws for it the

1262
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:37,960
motive of Richard Scranton is that so he

1263
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,150
was a he was a fourteen-year-old kid

1264
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,400
when he wrote the elk cloner and he and

1265
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,990
his buddies like a lot of kids who used

1266
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,170
those computers in those days we're

1267
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:51,098
swapping you know bootleg copies of

1268
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:54,130
games and so he decided to do this to

1269
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:55,540
create this thing so every 50th boot his

1270
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,760
buddies would have to sort of you know

1271
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,529
be annoyed by the fact that this thing

1272
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,020
like popped up and it was just sort of a

1273
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:04,390
nuisance to him but it was it was purely

1274
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,520
just like fourteen-year-old spite and

1275
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:09,310
and I think that's basically the case

1276
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,099
with the the BHP virus guys as well it

1277
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:13,779
was just it was just showing off to the

1278
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:15,609
prove that it could be done but like I

1279
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,440
mean it was really advanced the BHP

1280
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:19,119
virus in particular is is kind of

1281
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,160
mind-blowing when you think about the

1282
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,720
fact that that was 30 years ago that

1283
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,160
people were doing things like doing

1284
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,299
memory resident malware that was

1285
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:30,578
polymorphic and you know and just did

1286
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,079
you using all these tricks you know they

1287
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:34,660
they pioneered all this stuff in the

1288
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:40,470
course of making it

1289
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:40,470
anyone else yes person in the back

1290
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,740
okay so the question is how does this

1291
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,690
help you understand malware today really

1292
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:54,500
what I think is important is that it

1293
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:57,620
tells us all that this that these tricks

1294
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,870
that were pioneered 30 40 years ago to

1295
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,690
make these things work are still in use

1296
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:05,410
and that if you understand that sort of

1297
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:08,510
like this is the origin of you know

1298
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:11,600
polymorphism or a few skatin techniques

1299
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:13,220
or memory resident malware or the use of

1300
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,830
passwords or the use of brute force

1301
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,419
techniques that like everything kind of

1302
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:19,460
stems from this it's like it's like

1303
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,950
checking the root of the tree to see

1304
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,660
like you know to understand the health

1305
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:25,609
of where the branches are gonna go and

1306
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,080
for me it was just sort of an

1307
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,180
interesting exploration because they had

1308
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,150
this this hardware available and as a

1309
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,890
media archaeology project I don't feel

1310
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,480
like malware has actually been preserved

1311
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:37,670
I mean for the most part all we try to

1312
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,210
do all day long and in my industry is

1313
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,920
kill it and get rid of it and this stuff

1314
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:44,690
has educational value and it has

1315
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,060
historic value and even if it's just

1316
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:51,380
something that's displaying a goofy poem

1317
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:53,259
I still think it has some value so don't

1318
00:57:51,380 --> 00:58:00,440
know if that really answers the question

1319
00:57:53,260 --> 00:58:03,320
right yeah oh there is why is it called

1320
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,680
elk cloner well it wasn't because of the

1321
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,300
elk stack I do not know actually that's

1322
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,129
a really good question and I don't know

1323
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,500
the answer to it but seeing as I am in

1324
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,330
contact with scranton you can follow me

1325
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,340
on Twitter and I will ask him that

1326
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:20,470
question and if he answers me I'll post

1327
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:26,470
it I don't know all right

1328
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:28,819
how we doing on time I got three minutes

1329
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,109
the folks who asked the questions if you

1330
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,480
want to come up and choose a prize

1331
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,980
that's cool and if not then I'll just

1332
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,450

at 11:30 where I'm gonna just walk

1337
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,119
through how to get how to get these

1338
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,760
emulators start them up and where you

1339
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:52,440
can use you can find disk images and you

1340
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,609
can then you know run your own Commodore

1341
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,609
64 stuff on your own machine
