1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,689
little full house awesome

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,460
well ladies and gentlemen hope you are

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,650
enjoying yourself I think on welcome to

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,570
avoiding putting yourself in a silver

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,830
platter for hackers security framework

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,930
101 I am Victor steamer Morales I'm

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,900
currently a senior DevOps engineer at

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,880
nice in contact I've been in an industry

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,459
for about 10 ish years

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,500
wait DevOps engineer I think I'm in the

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,380
wrong talk he's not even on the security

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,420
team well in the security team or not

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,100
always remember that security it's

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,379
everybody's responsibility

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,920
we should always at least tries to do

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,180
our due diligence and the thing is

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,480
whether we're in the security team or

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,410
not the business is still vulnerable it

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,480
is still open to attackers and the more

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,218
eyes that we have on it the better our

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,430
bit our security posture will be on it

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,800
but then again for all this for everyone

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,930
who's not on the security team who else

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,270
really knows more intimately those

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,659
systems those environments those

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,970
networks than us again we're in their

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,530
day and out we understand all the little

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,048
things that we're tweaking we understand

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,780
all the stuff that we ourselves

30
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:25,049
considered normal for normal behavior

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,909
for our systems and again it is a lot

32
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,549
it is a lot on top of our daily

33
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,579
operations to to add more stuff and I

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,540
understand you know who now on top of

35
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,789
you know running the day-to-day

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,560
operations you're gonna add security on

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,579
me oh and that's a lot on the bucket I

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,619
understand the feeling I really really

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,970
do but this is the perfect thing why

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,549
security frameworks comes to be there

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,950
honestly done by wonderful engineers

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,140
wonderful people in the security

43
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,270
profession trying to give us a little

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,979
taste of on our little taste but more of

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,048
like different aspects of where we can

46
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,840
look for in our systems and again

47
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,360
that'll be our starting point a little

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
table of contents again we're going to

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,470
start off with what our security

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,840
frameworks you know helping us and raise

51
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,180
the bar a little the types of frameworks

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,650
that are available

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,940
understanding our needs again we all

54
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,860
have different needs from you know

55
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,230
someone working networking all the way

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,850
to doing applications and then we're

57
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,739
gonna start looking a little bit of how

58
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,790
we can start implementing these things

59
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,890
into our environment and remembering not

60
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,299
the Silver Bullet and throughout the

61
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,459
presentation I always start giving a

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,440
little bit of gotchas here and there so

63
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,920
the first word what our security

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,050
frameworks the main thing that I

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,380
security frameworks helps us try to

66
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,810
defend is again scary you know scary

67
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,350
hackers what there's a big difference

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,420
between you know China or Russia

69
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,980
hopefully I don't get people for that

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,200
but you know the nation-states trying to

71
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,239
attack organization then little Billy

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,920
down the street with little Timmy trying

73
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,450
to download some scripts and try to

74
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,458
point them into our network there's a

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,880
huge difference and that's a thing of

76
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,670
like when security frameworks are our

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,829
implementing our started it literally

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,579
gives us a baseline to try to avoid you

79
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,680
know keep giving us a foundation to

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,260
avoid like little Timmy to just download

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,830
a program and you know pone us and try

82
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,109
to extract our information again is

83
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,690
trying to make their life a little bit

84
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,040
harder to actually try to know what

85
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,900
they're doing before trying to execute

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,109
some scripts and make it a little bit

87
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,260
easier for us to manage these systems

88
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,850
and again there's different levels to

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,519
hacking there's different levels to

90
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,079
hackers and the more that we pay

91
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,230
attention to these small little things

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,630
will help us definitely raise the bar so

93
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,780
a little bit where are they they're a

94
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,040
combination of policies procedures that

95
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,959
help us define certain aspects of our

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,329
environment to help us you know to

97
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,650
document this theoretical aspect to it

98
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:17,228
these frameworks are time are designed

99
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,739
to specific domains within our

100
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:23,260
environments again there's different

101
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:26,739
frameworks to help us understand how to

102
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,409
properly what can we call it how to

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,780
properly

104
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:34,938
protectors like healthcare information

105
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,929
how to properly defend our networking

106
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,870
defend a lot of these things and

107
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,620
following specifics frameworks will help

108
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:48,090
us really create a sense of direction in

109
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,770
our in our ways that we see security as

110
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,479
a whole again some of us are not

111
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,849
security professionals that's a

112
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,530
full-time gig but it's always good to

113
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,419
try to lean on those professionals that

114
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,008
have done the research and have done a

115
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,659
lot of that legwork so we can take

116
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,400
advantage and you know step on their

117
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:05,389
shoulders or you know hang on their

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,549
shoulders again this also helps us

119
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,930
become aware of stuff that maybe we

120
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,990
don't really play with on a day-to-day

121
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,599
basis figure out some of the stuff that

122
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,409
honestly we didn't even know existed and

123
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:22,259
sometimes in our in our environments but

124
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:23,550
you kind of give us a little bit of you

125
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,469
know going inside the skeleton of a

126
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:30,060
framework a lot of the common frameworks

127
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:33,449
do share a lot of this come in common

128
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,819
cycle but in order for us to even begin

129
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,819
implementing any type of frameworks we

130
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:42,690
need to first identify what exactly are

131
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,729
we in charge of and if not us but maybe

132
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,370
we're looking at a big organization is

133
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:52,139
what exactly are we wanting to protect

134
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,389
and that's the first thing for any

135
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,289
security framework or any security

136
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,289
process or policies is let's make an

137
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,930
inventory what do we have out there and

138
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:06,719
I understand it's easier said than done

139
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,310
because sometimes there's so many people

140
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,990
in every organization and they're doing

141
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,750
all this stuff especially when it comes

142
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,430
to DevOps there's stuff that comes out

143
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,169
of nowhere and they may come down out of

144
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,180
nowhere and it really really becomes

145
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,830
really really hard to try even get that

146
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,379
first part which is just identifying

147
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,839
them for me the assets that we have in

148
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,639
our network but then again once we start

149
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,529
identifying all these things we can

150
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,419
start categorizing them and knowing

151
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:33,479
where we're gonna start protecting we

152
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,849
can start implementing a web application

153
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,758
for firewalls we can start playing

154
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,529
different types of policies and after

155
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,159
that we can start monitoring our

156
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,139
information

157
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,589
where the second part is detect

158
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,289
detecting a lot of this abnormal

159
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,419
behavior but again in order first even

160
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,979
get there we need to identify first what

161
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,739
do we have and what is considered normal

162
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,389
day-to-day after that once we started

163
00:06:55,739 --> 00:07:01,080
knowing how to detect and monitor our

164
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:03,149
systems we can start going to where we

165
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,919
can simulate or figure out how we're

166
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:08,759
going to respond to certain incidents in

167
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,119
our environment and then again hopefully

168
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,099
whatever incidents that you do get

169
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:15,569
doesn't cost very lasting damage and

170
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,699
that's where we go to the last one how

171
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:21,539
do we recover from any of these

172
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,069
incidents the next thing like I said now

173
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,818
that we see the skeleton of a framework

174
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,679
we really gotta understand our needs

175
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:32,429
again going back to the first comment I

176
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:35,068
said by my network engineer what I'm in

177
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:36,659
charge of is the whole entire network

178
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,610
infrastructure and I have different

179
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,889
needs than the database administrator

180
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,929
would which also will have a different

181
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,689
need that for example add a DevOps

182
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,768
engineer will have their different

183
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,360
aspects that we need to start

184
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,889
identifying what are we in charge of and

185
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,050
then again once we start getting that

186
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,669
inventory what is important what is

187
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,759
considered critical what is considered

188
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,378
sensitive I'm going to learn how to

189
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,349
distinguish does helped us tackle it in

190
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,719
a different way again different stuff

191
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,219
that we have open and open to the

192
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,490
customers open to the public

193
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:11,610
carry different risks what risk are we

194
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,619
willing to accept well risk are we not

195
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,990
willing to accept but are willing to

196
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:18,569
invest the game the amount of funds

197
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,209
needed to properly protect these these

198
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:23,909
assets and the law and the other thing

199
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,529
is okay as IT professionals we might

200
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,558
think that the most important thing for

201
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:30,479
us is our databases cool we need to

202
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:33,469
start focusing and put our our time and

203
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,000
effort in that but then the business

204
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:39,539
goals are actually to protect everything

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,870
under finance so the main thing after

206
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,610
when trying to build these when trying

207
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,220
to implement these frameworks always

208
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,540
keep in mind that we have a certain

209
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,399
perspective in the business has a

210
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,860
certain perspective and the better that

211
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,520
we align with them will give us a better

212
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,980
leg especially when asked

213
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,170
for resources they will be more willing

214
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,480
when they see that we're providing value

215
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,329
in the program that we're trying to

216
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,620
implement because again maybe they do

217
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:11,080
are willing to let marketing go down you

218
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,399
know good thrown under the bus but as

219
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,470
long as the accounting department

220
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,390
doesn't get thrown under the bus again

221
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,589
weighing those risk in the line them

222
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,689
with the business definitely really

223
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,990
helps us have them you know be with us

224
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,490
and then the last thing is especially

225
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,700
when trying to identify these needs is

226
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,970
where does your data live especially in

227
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,230
this time where a lot of companies are

228
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,420
transitioning and throwing everything

229
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,649
into the cloud we really need to pay

230
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,060
attention where this lives

231
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,920
because every continent every region has

232
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,199
different regulations for how to manage

233
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,449
that data Europe has a different way of

234
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,070
managing it towards the US and the US

235
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,980
has a different way of managing in Asia

236
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,720
and knowing that were not only

237
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,029
implementing these programs but knowing

238
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,540
that we're also following the regulation

239
00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:01,510
and the laws in that region

240
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,209
now think thanks to Amazon they I was

241
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,829
able to copy like a good list of

242
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:08,949
different types of security frameworks

243
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:11,890
that are available and I was like I was

244
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,690
mentioning the last point was knowing

245
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,130
what your deal is because again they all

246
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,260
have different regulations as you can

247
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,700
see from the slides we have for example

248
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,790
all the regulations that you can get

249
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,250
from the US on the top one you can see

250
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:28,180
age' parts of Europe and then you know

251
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,480
global as a global organization and the

252
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,949
things to keep in mind is that you know

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,950
for me coming from a healthcare in the

254
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,630
academic background a lot of the stuff

255
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,240
that was very important to us was PCI

256
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,070
which again PCI is for the payment

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,779
credit card industry the other one was

258
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,279
for healthcare which was HIPAA and when

259
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,380
we started we may actually have a good

260
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,899
grasp of what the needs that we really

261
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,550
have we can start going through all

262
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:56,110
these frameworks and understand that

263
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,520
some of them are going to be better for

264
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,930
others to literally tackle our stuff the

265
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,779
other thing to always keep in mind is

266
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,680
that

267
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,930
once we want to start implementing these

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,000
frameworks it's really really good that

269
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,258
before we start moving or doing any

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,449
other stuff that we get the planning

271
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,339
stages right reading all the

272
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,750
documentation and making sure that what

273
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,720
we're trying to accomplish will bring

274
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,629
value to the organization now

275
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,790
implementing always remember that when

276
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:31,319
we're doing these frameworks frameworks

277
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:32,879
are are not a one-size-fits-all again

278
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:33,899
when a lot of these security

279
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,730
professionals are building these

280
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,009
frameworks they're trying to be as broad

281
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,350
as possible and again what we're trying

282
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:42,180
to do as professionals get those

283
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,740
policies those frameworks and implement

284
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,930
into our network and try to be as

285
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,970
specific as possible what I really want

286
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,229
to drive through is that when we start

287
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,480
implementing these security frameworks

288
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,149
just because we comply with them 100%

289
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,930
does not necessarily mean they're 100%

290
00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:01,170
secure it is merely a talking point

291
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,209
merely a start merely a foundation that

292
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,740
we can start going through these

293
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,500
documentation and using them as a

294
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,879
guideline because then again what I was

295
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,620
trying to get you these are provided to

296
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,529
try to you know be as broad as possible

297
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,339
in who else better knows our environment

298
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:20,009
than we do that's when we start tweaking

299
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:22,740
to what our needs are I kinda want to go

300
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:26,100
for a little story about I know a lot of

301
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,839
a lot of security vendors especially

302
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,860
when going down the configuration

303
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:35,610
management route they have what we call

304
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:38,339
it kind of like a button to point out

305
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,879
but bunch of machines and make them X

306
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,230
compliant or Y compliant in the problem

307
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,689
is I remember when we're trying to do

308
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,120
that with CIS which is in the Center for

309
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:51,660
Internet Security it locked us out of

310
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,699
our own box because again the purpose is

311
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,980
to try and lock it down as possible and

312
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:58,529
make it as broad as possible but that's

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,360
when I can kind of give you the one big

314
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,829
gotcha if you think you're gonna do is

315
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,410
really really quick and you're just

316
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,839
gonna build a manifest and pop it build

317
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,209
the recipe and chef to try to make you

318
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,100
know knock this out as fast as possible

319
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:14,579
you're gonna have a bad time because

320
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,069
again it's just a starting point this is

321
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,640
a conversation that we need to have

322
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,140
again when we start

323
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,300
implementing a lot of these things

324
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,550
remember read the whole documentation

325
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,500
get the full story before touching any

326
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,479
of these machines get the full story

327
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,240
before even having this conversation

328
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,180
with your managers or whoever's and the

329
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,100
higher up that way when we get there by

330
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,540
off we can say like hey this is part of

331
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,880
the documentation and this is something

332
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,280
that it's going to give us to a better a

333
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,280
better position and again I'm gonna

334
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,689
reiterate identify your resources who's

335
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,600
gonna be part of that project to help

336
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:52,710
you implement that framework because it

337
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,840
does become difficult when you know you

338
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,010
may not be progressing as far as fast as

339
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,080
you want when implementing these

340
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,030
frameworks and knowing that you have

341
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,030
other dedicated resources to help you go

342
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:06,120
through it it'll be easier to know that

343
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:09,329
you can you know divide the work equally

344
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,820
amongst the other peers but then again I

345
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,970
understand at least for some of us they

346
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,080
are not in the security team it could be

347
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,480
it could be very difficult especially

348
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,240
trying to keep the lights on it that's

349
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,090
hard as it is and that changes every day

350
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,920
and now imagine an executing to it but

351
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,540
that's why I find it important that we

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,910
need to identify those resources are

353
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:34,170
gonna be helping us you know throughout

354
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:37,319
this journey the next part is document

355
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,300
document document whenever this changes

356
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,000
and you know higher-ups tells us hey

357
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:46,050
where are we with being PCI compliant we

358
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,460
have documentation and oh well Fred that

359
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,729
went on vacation is the one that really

360
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,470
understands where we're at you know that

361
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,790
and I become very very difficult

362
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,200
especially when we're trying to

363
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,360
communicate this and trying to get the

364
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,190
BI off from higher-ups so document

365
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,600
document document communicate this among

366
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,000
all the team members who are involved

367
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,910
all the stakeholders all the managers

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,320
all the persons are again helping you by

369
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,209
being a resource you try to get this up

370
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,620
and running and like I said first in

371
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,690
order for us to be successful when

372
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,090
implementing it make sure that you have

373
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,470
the higher-ups buy off and make sure

374
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,450
that again they're aligning with the

375
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,710
business goals because when you're going

376
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,660
to give the business goals and you're

377
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,150
trying I understand security is a big

378
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,680
thing that we need to take care of when

379
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,240
the business doesn't see value in it

380
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,739
you're not gonna get a lot of help from

381
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,820
it think I want to say for this one is

382
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,730
remember that security frameworks is not

383
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:48,040
a silver bullet it is merely a baseline

384
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,620
for us to get insurance for example when

385
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,760
it comes to PCI compliance the main goal

386
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,470
is to try to keep payment card payment

387
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,689
credit card information as safe as

388
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,779
possible try to get anybody identified

389
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:06,160
with those credit cards but as we know

390
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:08,290
sadly is it's not a matter of if you get

391
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,329
hacked is win and when you get hacked

392
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,890
this that's the whole time the whole

393
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,930
thing like again like the last part of

394
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,480
the framework the recovery how we're

395
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,819
gonna recover from this and I just want

396
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,230
to iterate that just because we're

397
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,930
compliant doesn't necessarily we're

398
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,180
secure and going back to the

399
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,760
shareability if a lot of companies

400
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,250
knowing the fact that it's a matter of

401
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,529
when we'll purchase insurance but a lot

402
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,850
of insurance company will first want to

403
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,740
make sure that you're compliant to some

404
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,660
type of framework and again going back

405
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,120
to PCI if you're gonna get insurance for

406
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,709
PCI they're gonna want to have that

407
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,060
little logo would look piece of paper

408
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:48,459
saying that yeah you're compliant and

409
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:50,050
we'll give you insurance but like I said

410
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:52,479
in the beginning is just a bare minimum

411
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:56,109
it's a talking point that we can get to

412
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,550
start implementing these processes I do

413
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,680
understand that the process could be

414
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,199
exhausting going through every server

415
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,780
going through every layer it's really

416
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,189
really exhausting to try to you know get

417
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,599
the big picture and get everything

418
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:14,890
implemented but again you'll have a base

419
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:18,909
you'll have a foundation you'll you'll

420
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,260
be able to at least be able to little

421
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:25,480
bit sleep at night knowing that you have

422
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:28,629
a baseline covering your back and I do

423
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,030
want to quote this video I saw some

424
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,520
hacks live on where they were kind of

425
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,360
saying a little bit about the us being

426
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,550
compliance in not really trying to build

427
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,840
a false sense of security and I really

428
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,760
really love this quote if it says it's

429
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,939
like getting your driver's license you

430
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,950
can do the Behrman

431
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,140
to get your driver's license and then

432
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,430
you're allowed on the road that doesn't

433
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,410
mean that you're not going to drive a

434
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,990
truck to a herd of nuns it just means

435
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,960
you're allowed to drive and we're doing

436
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,340
these frameworks is literally that it's

437
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,260
not that necessarily that you're 100%

438
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,530
secure it's just you're now insurable

439
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,170
now you can buy insurance but again they

440
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,930
do have advantages the advantages of a

441
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,840
lot of these frameworks is you actually

442
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,400
have some Syrian half the security that

443
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,709
you have you have a better grip of

444
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,210
what's in your environment but the

445
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,730
disadvantage is that you do have it it's

446
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,210
very time consuming and a very resource

447
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,710
intensive but the payoff is that

448
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,310
everything is documented the payoff is

449
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,160
that you do have ways to actually show

450
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:35,030
that hey in case of a breach we did our

451
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,160
due diligence the last thing I would

452
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,070
like to say to you guys is remember Rome

453
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,870
was not built in a day he's gonna take a

454
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,460
little bit of time he's gonna be a

455
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,250
little bit of time but it's gonna take

456
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,740
you know little sessions after sessions

457
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,500
of trying to get this up and running but

458
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,300
the better better posture that you have

459
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,100
in a security sense the better your

460
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,139
business will be because if your

461
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,550
business is struggling you're gonna be

462
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,080
struggling and if they go out of

463
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,879
business because of a hacker we're out

464
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:07,490
of a job so always remember that

465
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,480
Security's everybody's concerned

466
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,190
everybody's responsibility and whatever

467
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,740
the biggest risk that we have in

468
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,020
organization at least as IT professional

469
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,010
software professionals let's try to

470
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:25,120
mitigate the risk as much as possible

471
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,120
and thank you for coming

472
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:32,119
[Applause]
