19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,059

in just a moment our badge this year was

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,360
epoch or epic I mean it depends on how

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,390
you pronounced that ladies and gentlemen

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,939

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,590
have to flash often let me just help you

35
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,780
understand how cool the badge really was

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,310
you probably attended to some of his

37
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,100
talk and he might not have told you

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,590
about all the hard things or the things

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,980
that happened behind the curtains but we

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,220
had never really been able to assemble

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:55,149
26 of those badges in a circle until

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:57,459
Monday this week and so it was epic that

43
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,620
it even sort of work and that's why it

44
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,810
took us until a little bit later on

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,580
Tuesday to make sure that the badge code

46
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,920
was working enough to get it out for you

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,380
all but Mike did an incredible job

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:15,940
none of the fault goes to him it's all

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:17,920
China and tariffs there's another key

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,790
word is there no we're not gonna go

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,950
there what but what I will say is it was

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,959
our pleasure to pay the tariffs to get

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,988
those badges here as quickly as possible

54
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,050
so anyways thanks again Mike for your

55
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:35,050
help there all right this wouldn't be a

56
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,390
good ending if we didn't give our

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,560
sponsors at least some recognition and

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,309
so I'm gonna go through the sponsor

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,810
slides again of them you know in

60
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,010
particular comp unit they have been a

61
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,890
supporter of cencon for many many

62
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,349
years they've brought some incredibly

63
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,359
cool challenges the red vs. blue village

64
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,129
which we decided you know we've done

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,599
that a lot and so we figured maybe

66
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,849
switch it up and do active threat

67
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,659
hunting so we we brought it a different

68
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,149
group for that hopefully there yeah

69
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,790
honey but compiiment

70
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,799
has been a very valuable partner Qualis

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,780
decided new to the saint Kahn crew

72
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,269
hopefully they enjoyed their time here

73
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,739
they had the coolest booth I don't know

74
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,470
if we gave them any award for that but

75
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,410
we appreciate their their sponsorship

76
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:25,880
and partnership this year and we did

77
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:27,110
like their money and if you're thinking

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,150
about sponsoring if you have a business

79
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,360
that thinks about sponsoring st. Kahn

80
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,638
we're actually really cheap we'll take

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,500
any amount of money just give it to us

82
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,120
and we'll put it right toward the badge

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,800
or the tariffs okay our silver sponsors

84
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,139
many of these are returning sponsors we

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,570
have them year over year we'd like to

86
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,150
thank them for their involvement and our

87
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,949
spawn sponsors guess what next year

88
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,359
we're not gonna have levels of sponsors

89
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,680
that's gonna be first come first serve

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,820
and they're all just gonna be on one big

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,039
slide or yeah or not we'll figure it out

92
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,719
but they do such an awesome job and

93
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,580
that's the reason why we get to do such

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,889
cool things that money goes directly

95
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,359
back into the conference it goes to

96
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,830
subsidize things like if we were to go

97
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,289
do the math right now most probably

98
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,969
eighty dollars worth of hardware that

99
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,349
you have around your name at this point

100
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:28,669
or more I don't know Mike is it more

101
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:29,990
well Paris shipping all right and it

102
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,789
also wouldn't be a great closing

103
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,440
presentation if we didn't take just a

104
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,909
moment to have the committee members

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,310
stand up and accept their round of

106
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,870
applause for the incredible planning

107
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,060
that has gone in to the conference and

108
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,490
making it as smooth as possible so stand

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,930
up if you're one of these or other folks

110
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,930
that I might not have mentioned

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,840
and and I got another follow-up slide

112
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,979
for that here in just a moment I just

113
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,419
didn't remind her they are all

114
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,610
volunteers so if something's not working

115
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,230
quite right

116
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,580
remember you only paid two hundred and

117
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,620
seventy five to three hundred and

118
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,380
seventy or whatever dollars to be here

119
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:19,320
and whatever you know what I'm trying to

120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,469
say don't give them a hard time

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,060
all right I get asked often during sync

122
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,100
on many questions I'm just gonna not

123
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,610
knock them out right here okay

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,600
how do I get involved with Saint on

125
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,340
that's probably the number one most

126
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,590
asked question here's the answer just

127
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,710
write it down save it in a Google Doc

128
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,320
somewhere so you can refer to it later

129
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,750
ultimately it is that sometime in an

130
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,940
April May June okay that's a three month

131
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,720
window I know it's a big window but in

132
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,830
April May June out goes our call for

133
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,270
staff and volunteers so it goes out it's

134
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,159
published on our website it's on our

135
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,919
Twitter feeds it goes out to the Utah

136
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,080
State organization email lists if you

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,320
have interest in becoming involved in

138
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,640
what we're doing here behind the scenes

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,520
that's how you get involved as you

140
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,710
answer that call for volunteers the next

141
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,859
most common question we have is paying

142
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:18,370
horse Chunkin we were so honored to have

143
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,170
a mirror here this year those of you

144
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,440
that got to hang out and meet her and

145
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,690
chat with him I'll tell you what his

146
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,670
wife I mean they're gone so I can say

147
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,310
this out loud to y'all

148
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,560
his wife has never seen him smile like

149
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,230
that in the last two years ever since

150
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,410
his disability it was immensely valuable

151
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,660
for him to come and see all of you all

152
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,120
that know who he is and the respect that

153
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,450
you have for him so I thank you for

154
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,920
giving that love and honor to chunker

155
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,349
the next one is how many people are here

156
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,880
at st. Conn the numbers fluctuates the

157
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,100
best number I'll give you is about

158
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,900
twelve hundred and fifty how do I join

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,250
the Utah State organization we'll cover

160
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,440
that in a slide in just a moment but I

161
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,380
forgot to put one up there how many cans

162
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,469
of

163
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,390
do we go through um

164
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,490
we'll get the count here in a little bit

165
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:12,020
and we'll get the bill probably a week

166
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:16,610
or so later but it's a lot last year it

167
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:21,799
was just a little under 9,000 so you

168
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:26,300
guys all need to just drink well the

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,590
water costs money too but yes you guys

170
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,200
drink a lot of soda but here's the

171
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,729
interesting part

172
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,939
90% of it we swear we don't know for

173
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:39,289
sure but we know happens just in one

174
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,970
night and that's family night when you

175
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,370
get the hype up a bunch of kids on

176
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,510
caffeine it is amazing what happens okay

177
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,160
so let's talk about the Utah State

178
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:54,950
organization this conference and the the

179
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,209
underlying organization that presents

180
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,880
this conference is the Utah State

181
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,680
organization if you haven't heard about

182
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,710
it it's because it's the best kept

183
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,390
private security secret in Utah we don't

184
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,490
promote ourselves it's not this big

185
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,560
grandiose kind of thing but it is an

186
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,360
organization of like-minded security

187
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,050
professionals that like to get together

188
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,450
and talk about and muse about security

189
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,670
related things if you would like to

190
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,610
become a member it costs exactly zero

191
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,620
dollars to do so and you can go out to

192
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,540

194
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,530

following October as we do some

198
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,760

briefings before it's not gonna be a ton

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,280

203
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,260
best kept secrets every other week on a

204

it takes an amazing team to actually

277
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,940
build these contests it takes months of

278
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,800
lead-up time and just exhausting we are

279
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,610

contests and events for next year I

281
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:04,699
haven't told you this this week because

282
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,530
see that it takes so much time we need

283
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,309
to prep early so by the time you know

284
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,770

knee and all right let's go let's move

290
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,210
on to one of our last but signature

291
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:46,720
challenges that requires its own slide

292
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:53,690
the hackers challenge this year was

293
00:18:46,720 --> 00:19:04,220
awesome game once again epic first-place

294
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:18,530
winner this year is Spectre first of all

295
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:20,900
the fake home is awesome trophy second

296
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:25,399
and third we have factored and Mauro

297
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:39,320
they are well deserving and honorable

298
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:45,500
mention nope that's it that's it all

299
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,689
right we thanks letter think you need to

300
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,610
we're not ready for this slide yet Matt

301
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,250
come on up we've got a couple of other

302
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,270
contests and things that people can win

303
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,410
Matt's gonna explain all of those okay

304
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,120
still really quick while we're talking

305
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:03,260
to hackers challenge how many people did

306
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,209
the last board and hacker challenge was

307
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,900
that a win or a loss do it again bring

308
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,850
it back okay if you didn't find it you

309
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,440
probably should because I've heard from

310
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,439
several people that Josh is too smart

311
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,610
for them and they can't keep up with him

312
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,420
that's why they choose a dumb person

313
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,860
like me to do the other board so the lab

314
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,659
board is the one that I put together

315
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,370
well that's a lie

316
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:28,380
the labs board is the one I wrangled

317
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:32,850
people to put together for me I didn't

318
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,049
do a lot of the work so the labs board

319
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,610
is designed to be a little bit more of

320
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:37,350
an entry level a little bit more of a

321
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,479
simulated pen test as more some other

322
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,439
more traditional CTF type experiences

323
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,860
less easier for less smart people like

324
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,419
me anyway it is not a black badge event

325
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,360
but it is a fun event and I do have some

326
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,100
sweet prizes up here for these people

327
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,539
the first place then that was data bean

328
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:59,250
see here we're not having them come up

329
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,669
to the stage on a razor hand

330
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,529
now this blind helix he was in second

331
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,049
place third place was intrusive

332
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,940
delusional system intrusion delusional

333
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:12,029
system I have to call out because there

334
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,250
were a few negative point challenges in

335
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,950
the password file to prevent you from

336
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:21,320
brute-forcing it he happened to randomly

337
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,320
choose the negative 1,000 point hours

338
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:34,980
random - out of how many out of like

339
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:37,529
1,500 okay you won the lottery all right

340
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,820
I can't come find me after the prize

341
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,679
before you the other thing we did is the

342
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,689
SMB challenge again here we brought it

343
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,679

344
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,029
with that whether you did at the

345
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,299
competition or just to try it

00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:52,169
have fun put your hands together in that

347
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:55,110
we had first place was hamster he

348
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:58,860
finished everything and it worked and if

349
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,750
you know hamster this surprises no one

350
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,280
he had 10 minutes and 34 seconds left

351
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,030
and he kind of walked away casually and

352
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,030
said that was easy

353
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:12,820
second place was Josh Belcher he had 10

354
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,659
minutes and 34 seconds left also but one

355
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:19,120
led did not work third place was be most

356
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,160

364
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,050

labs and the other things it was awesome

366
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,559
and it was epic specifically Eldon and

367
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,450
Scottie saved my butt with the lab

368

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,240
just recognize an individual or a group

376
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:23,010
of individuals how many of you all

377
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:26,820
attended family night so bring it back

378
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:30,610
of course right well let me introduce

379
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:33,820
the reason why family night was so

380
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:37,990
utterly incredible this year because

381
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,879
guess who didn't plan it the conference

382
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,809
committee did not plan family mode I

383
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,180
would like to introduce lady as the head

384
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,920
of the stinking widow's group

385
00:23:46,180 --> 00:24:20,130
I don't even know what used to tell him

386
00:23:50,920 --> 00:24:30,670
other than that you guys Rock yep ik

387
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:33,100
thank you thank you and maybe just a

388
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,190
little side note ink on widows thing

389
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:40,709
doesn't make a lot of sense to y'all

390
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,710
most of the committee members are male

391
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,000
we would love to see more females in

392
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:52,510
world but because we're mostly man you

393
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,100
know we all have wives that or six to

394
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,700
eight months out of the year are widowed

395
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,830
because of this conference and so they

396
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:11,320
decided how to band together and form

397
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:13,929
the same time widows group and we

398
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,179
appreciate so much their support not

399
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,610
only here at the con but the support for

400
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,420
all of the countless hours that go into

401
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:27,669
it alright this is just a slide to say

402
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:36,880
that there was upon me Death March the

403
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:38,950
first ever Saint is they coming back all

404
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
four participants think that it should

405
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,940
come back

406
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,160
and and if you don't know this is Noah

407
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,330
right here I got his name right here

408
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,590
he's up on the front

409
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,909
he looks thrilled to be there doesn't he

410
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,870
like 7 a.m.

411
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,580
button run anyway okay last couple of

412
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,050
things so we're gonna conclude unless

413
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,370
I'm missing something any committee

414
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,440
member can come up and interrupt me at

415
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,139
any time now I'm forgetting something

416
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,050
but there is such a thing that we

417
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,930
affectionately call in the committee

418
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:14,350
will come and this is where we retire

419
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,880
after each day when we can get there and

420
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,459
before the hotel closes it at 10 o'clock

421
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,140
it's kind of stupid we should make it

422
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,640
part of a contract like hey we get these

423
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:29,210
number of hotel rooms can we just have

424
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,770
the anyways we all retire as a committee

425
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,380
out we stick our feet in the hot tub

426
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,700
when we talk about the conference and if

427
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,130
you want to know why st. John gets

428
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,440
bigger and better and crazier

429
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,960
year-over-year it's because we go out

430
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,320
there and we sit in the hot cut together

431
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,480
this is not an actual photo but we've

432
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,129
already started planning we know some of

433
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,320
the things that we want to be doing some

434
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,750
of the things that we need to fix and so

435
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,659
saint khan will be even better one of

436
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,940
the last points to make here is that we

437
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,800
already have our days that's the first

438
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:09,590
time ever that we know what the dates

439
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:11,870
are for stink on 20/20 so plan on it but

440
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:19,340
wait for an email in June just to

441
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:24,889
confirm so anyway I think that's pretty

442
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:29,290
much okay something we have one more

443
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,290
thing we all need to give a big

444
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,420
Troy has helped us to make Spain town

445
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,910
great for so many years and I think you

446
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:47,790
all know how amazing this event is thank

447
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:51,240
you very much toy alright now we're done

448
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:53,700
okay okay we hope you enjoyed staying on

449
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,090
20:19 this is the last slide it's time

450
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,660
to go home don't like it don't leave yet

451
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:02,280
we could use just a little bit of help

452
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,920
it takes us a lot of time it takes us

453
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,410
like almost 40 hours to set this place

454
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,390
up if all you will do before you leave

455
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,360
is if there's a power strip not the

456
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,220
cables and cords a power strip there's a

457
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,919
power strip below you will you unhook it

458
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,640
and put it on the table that's all we

459
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,290
need you to do this year okay and with

460
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,559
