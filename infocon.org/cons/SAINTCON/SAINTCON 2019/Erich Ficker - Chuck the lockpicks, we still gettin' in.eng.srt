my talk here and their Loch sport is

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,239
literally an art like the people that

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,539
are good at this are amazing

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:02,339
I'm not amazing and I'm not patient so

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,949
I'm a bad fit for that hobby but they're

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,430
pretty awesome so I do poke a little bit

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,350
of fun but also super super high respect

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,689

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,470

Internet's so you're welcome

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,729

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,670
like some things like 3d printing for

34
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:52,798

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,409
shy to raise your hand or yell out which

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,250
I highly recommend please do that if

41
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,399
you're comfortable doing that if you're

42
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,640
not tweet to me and all I'll answer

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,280
those after the after the fact

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,959
so we're talking about a few things

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,850
here's the topics so we're going to talk

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,150
about engagement planning for physical

47
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,430
pen testing how to look at a site and

48
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,110
determine where you should be going what

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,020
you should be attacking your methods of

50
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:34,140
attack welcome Pope classic we're going

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,160
to talk about laches a little bit cuz

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,260
that's the main thing we're attacking

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,000
and then wrap it up okay so number one

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,060
thing you need to do is understand what

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,830
your client is looking for the client

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,530
thinks oh I want a physical pen test I

57
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,390
want to make sure my locks work cool

58
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,250
what does that mean does that mean that

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,809
I come in and we meet and then you tell

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,910
me you introduce me to all your people

61
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,709
and then we start messing around does

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,690
that mean I'm coming in at night with

63
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,890
ninja clothes we're doing the day with

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,079
ninja clothes doesn't really work as

65
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,649
well and what is the driver for the

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,540
engagement okay is there the most the

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,040
time I see this type of pen testing that

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,380
we're contracted to step pen testing is

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,329
for corporate governance somebody on the

70
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,220
board said hey can someone break into

71
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,560
our building we know we have a firewall

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,239
we've got some blinky boxes can someone

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,500
break into our building physically get

74
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,709
on the network do things that we don't

75
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,160
want them to do etc it's not often

76
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,320
driven by compliance PCI FedRAMP that

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,090
kind of thing although they could bolt

78
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,680
it on sometimes so just understand why

79
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,750
the client wants this and that will help

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,970
you to direct them to what they actually

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,430
want to do and then look at the

82
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,080
requirements if they're gonna write you

83
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,940
a check for five digits they probably

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,400
have an idea of what they want to see in

85
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,739
the deliverable and then to find the

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,650
scope rules of engagement I will talk a

87
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,080
little bit about that in a second do

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,209
they want you to I mean are we just

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,560
breaking in through any methods

90
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,049
necessary usually people don't wanna

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,700
replace their $500 locks commercial

92
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,049
locks pretty spendy right because we got

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,910
to keep the Loch sport guys out so I

94
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,850
means many more pins and more more

95
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,359
goodies in their rows etc somebody

96
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,359
recognize these guys

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,360
yeah what's that

98
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,940
so these guys these guys were arrested

99
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,680
for breaking into a courthouse now it's

100
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,330
unclear to me these guys actually did

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,530
anything wrong so they're not as a not

102
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,010
using them as an example of what not to

103
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,869
do

104
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,860
I'm using an example of what can happen

105
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,460
if you don't Devine all the different

106
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,180
complexities in come into play so

107
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,859
according to documents that came out

108
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,650
after they are arrested like arrested

109
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,900
like cuffed in chrome you're out of here

110
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,460
back of a police car you're booked

111
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,989
obviously we have their mugshots after

112
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,000
the fact that comes out that the rules

113
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,669
of engagement was pretty clear they had

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,780
a get-out-of-jail-free letter that

115
00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:03,729
called the right people the breakdown

116
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,198
appears to be that the state client

117
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,880
didn't notify the local authorities that

118
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,449
this was taking place am I wrong zoobi

119
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,449
no better than that

120
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:19,789
yeah so yeah yeah anyway some

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,750
miscommunications now I think they did

122
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,300
everything right from what I can tell

123
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,340
from the documentation but they still

124
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,930
went to jail like they went to jail I

125
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,510
think they're out they got out on bail

126
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm sure but they stopped to deal with

127
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,310
these charges that exist if I'm law

128
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,870
enforcement now do they do anything

129
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,900
wrong I don't think so they showed up to

130
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,360
a State Building and there were people

131
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,599
that were seemingly unauthorized to be

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
there they had tools by the way can you

133
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,949
be arrested for having tools that could

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,240
be used to force entry into a building

135
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:58,610
can be arrested for that mmm I think all

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,380
states allow this actually but there's

137
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:05,389
one piece that there is it there is a

138
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,740
caveat intent who said that nice this

139
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,449
guy's my buddy right here thank you

140
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,220
okay if you have the they have to prove

141
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,289
intent you can walk around with all the

142
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,130
slim jims in your backpack you want but

143
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,570
if they don't have if you don't have

144
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,820
intent to go in somewhere that you

145
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,219
shouldn't be then you can have those

146
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,080
possession isn't the crime but once you

147
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,880
once they prove intent then they tack

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,719
that on just I guess for some more time

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,130
I don't know so a non example of what

150
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,020
not to do but what example if could

151
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,409
happen they probably didn't understand

152
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,180
that the state

153
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,500
law enforcement wasn't gonna tell the

154
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,670
local law enforcement that hey this is

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,270
happening and you're gonna be the one

156
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,380
responding to any kind of incident so

157
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,440
hard to know where hard to predict this

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,420
was gonna happen I think they did

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,990
everything right

160
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,660
so anyway be super careful I guess is

161
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,330
the moral the story okay so your

162
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,500
approach are you gonna be social

163
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,760
engineering if your social engineering

164
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,600
is the best tactic to ask for the

165
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,760
manager probably not we want as low

166
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,040
level people as possible because they're

167
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,420
gonna be the ones that have the least

168
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,630
amount of training and have been there

169
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,250
the less and it probably paid the least

170
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:15,480
okay so if social engineering is your

171
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,980
attack approach I like I like the

172
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,740
Occam's razor approach to social

173
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,790
engineering which is typically and this

174
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,240
has never failed me yet

175
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:26,820
cross my fingers hi my name is Eric

176
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,890
we're performing a security assessment

177
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,070
on your building no don't call your boss

178
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:36,030
he's in on the test I'm just gonna go

179
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:39,120
through this door 100% of the time it

180
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:43,219
works for me it has worked 100% of the

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,480
time the last one we did like that I

182
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,130
walked up to the receptionist and I said

183
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,440
were performing you know security

184
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,090
assessment and she said okay and I saw

185
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,469
her pulling up slack and I said no no no

186
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,239
you can't you can't text

187
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,400
you can't message Jim he's he's part of

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
the test too okay but he told me not to

189
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,919
let anyone in

190
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,020
and I said that is very good advice and

191
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:08,120
then she handed over a visitor's badge

192
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:10,440
so it's it's hard this is hard to combat

193
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,280
we're a hundred percent successful so

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,510
far I hope I fail some time we got in

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,820
and there was some physical security

196
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,010
posters if you say see something say

197
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,719
something type of thing so that was fun

198
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,890
I did a couple of laps I'll show you the

199
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,160
floor plan of that attack in just a

200
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,510
second so what type of it when are you

201
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,860
going in during the day is a lot

202
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,250
different attack than during the night

203
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,990
okay so during the day probably social

204
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,580
engineering if you're going in during

205
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,240
the day like covertly through locked

206
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,729
doors

207
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,719
it's weird I haven't done that yet

208
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,400
nobody's wanted to do that yet it's a

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,899
lot easier just to go in where you're

210
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,399
supposed to be going in

211
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,949
so I usually would advise a client

212
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,589
against this type of attack and usually

213
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:54,258
we're going in on the social or cloned

214
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,089
electronic badge something like that

215
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,379
after hours are different obviously we

216
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,649
want to know about any kind of alarm

217
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,670
systems we want to identify we're gonna

218
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,720
talking about a minute about how to

219
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,709
identify ingress egress and a lot

220
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,240
different approach right we don't have a

221
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,638
lot of people around there's nobody in

222
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,899
the building it's just gonna be a little

223
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,860
bit different and that's where most of

224
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,610
these tools we're going to talk about

225
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,749
today come into play and come in handy

226
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,490
and then of course there's the trash

227
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:26,879
audit which that's where you send the

228
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,749
new guy right or the new gal Matt all

229
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:33,059
right okay so and then make sure you're

230
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:34,589
you identify clear and defined goals

231
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,939
like we want to just enter the building

232
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,079
do we want to get to a secure location

233
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,599
in the building

234
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,309
do we want to walk out with laptops we

235
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,420
want to sit down at unlock machine like

236
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,759
what are your goals during the day

237
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,829
unlock machines are everywhere an

238
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,179
awesome and if you're planned correctly

239
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,819
you can do some stuff in a short amount

240
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,559
of time usually it's a self in front of

241
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:59,179
the unlocked computer they don't want a

242
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,980
big mess on their network now or etc so

243
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:06,179
that's usually the case okay these two

244
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,670
most important things make sure the

245
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,470
client agrees okay and make sure the

246
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,079
client agrees in writing identify all

247
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,279
the things that you're gonna do and that

248
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,410
they know you're gonna do and that

249
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,299
they're good with all of it even

250
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,279
lock-picking is somewhat physically

251
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,639
destructive to the lock itself you're

252
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,249
hitting brass soft brass pins with hard

253
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,879
stainless tools our tools are a little

254
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:31,049
bit less invasive typically so anyway

255
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,319
just make sure that they know what

256
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:36,179
you're doing hopefully you don't end up

257
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,649
like the coal fire guys in jail we'd

258
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:42,899
like to avoid that that sounds

259
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:45,720
unpleasant okay so finally we get to

260
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,769
actually doing some stuff there is no

261
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,920
understating the value of ascent or just

262
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,769
flat googling Google the address of any

263
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,599
building any commercial building in

264
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,070
anywhere and you will find the listing

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,340
for when it was sold or leased

266
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,520
last okay here's one this is an

267
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,960
engagement we did and as a result we

268
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,569
were able to identify a couple of places

269
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,100
that were potentially problem spots you

270
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,780
can see the big hallway I'm gonna jump

271
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,640
down here you can see the big hallway in

272
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,400
the middle I think I got a laser it's

273
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,660
not very bright this is all common area

274
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,420
so we can hang out here as long as we

275
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,709
want there's some bathrooms back here

276
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,240
from the outside once we got there

277
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,130
realize there's some double doors there

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,190
that we're potential for being an issue

279
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,710
but you can be there be there in my air

280
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,030
quotes before you have to get there

281
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,080
okay which could be a problem if

282
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,760
specially if you have to travel out of

283
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,920
state if you just run out to Salt Lake

284
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,960
or local it's not the big deal you can

285
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,110
get eyes eyes on the location no big

286
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,930
deal but so for this engagement I'm

287
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,650
gonna actually come point to this we

288
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,120
pulled this map and we were so call

289
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,100
center instantly I already know it's a

290
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,140
call center client told me that but or I

291
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,790
could have just googled it we see a

292
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,050
couple of interesting things these this

293
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,849
is the elevator here it's hard to read

294
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,620
on this that's the elevator this is

295
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,750
reception they were not on the ground

296
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,010
floor so from there we know that if we

297
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,430
can get through the elevator and through

298
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,920
reception and through this door were

299
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,810
everywhere right there's no control no

300
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,920
physical controls anywhere else the

301
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,260
network room here so I know that this is

302
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,459
some sort of lounge area so we can

303
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,460
probably hang out and there as long as

304
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,020
we want to now when we actually got on

305
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,790
site we had this map beforehand when we

306
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,560
got on site you come out of the elevator

307
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,839
you immediately facing the receptionist

308
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,119
so there's no like coming up with a plan

309
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,130
after you get out of the elevator

310
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,060
luckily we had a plan already I kind of

311
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,000
went through it already that was the

312
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,439
same approach I just mentioned to you

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,690
what you could do if you didn't have a

314
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,980
map or one didn't exist go up the

315
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,780
elevator walk in and play the I'm dumb

316
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,370
game or if you have a person to burn

317
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,660
right you've got four people and you

318
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,460
only need to get in three times or two

319
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,760
times or whatever you can send thanks

320
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,280
you can send somebody in figure out the

321
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,950
label and send it back out hey I'm Eric

322
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,650
I don't know if I'm in the right place

323
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,720
what is this you know what am i here and

324
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,230
if it's the right place look around

325
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
I mean you

326
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,440
run super easy to run a cell phone in

327
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,210
your pocket with the camera out

328
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,090
does anybody ever gotten freaked out by

329
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,380
that before no because in your pocket

330
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,450
right nobody's nobody's paying attention

331
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,930
to that but the cameras still shooting

332
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,380
at you

333
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:32,969
right super easy I've done that several

334
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,280
times so lots of ways you can kind of

335
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,640
get the lay of the land that's one of

336
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,380
them

337
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,750
maps are great and they're all over

338
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,830
Google for sure I've never done a pen

339
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,700
test where I didn't have a map of the

340
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:46,830
building long before I got there okay

341
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,600
evaluate once you get there so some of

342
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,660
the doors and the ingress egress are

343
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,940
obvious on these maps we've got stairs

344
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,280
they're not on the beta main floor so

345
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,290
there may not be doors straight into the

346
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
building but we've got stairwells here

347
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,310
that are probably going to be less

348
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,939
populated and then of course we got the

349
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,959
elevator check out your cameras there's

350
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,430
a couple interesting things on this

351
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,530
photo that are probably a little bit

352
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,620
hard to see I'm a jump down again sorry

353
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:17,819
Pope we've got this is a door badge

354
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,770
reader here this is a master lock that

355
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,330
holds other lot other keys everybody

356
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,939
seen those before real estate agents use

357
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:28,380
them four digit code not a ton of

358
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:32,730
entropy camera here which is not active

359
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,280
so that didn't help them and funnily

360
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,020
enough there was another one of these

361
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,640
inside the building that was unlocked so

362
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,840
if you have one of those in the it's

363
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,640
unlocked you now have the code and if

364
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,370
they're coded the same now you know how

365
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,470
the keys on that outside lock or if you

366
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,240
have a die grinder you have the keys on

367
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,400
the outside lock that probably a

368
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,140
nighttime activity would be my guess but

369
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,959
die grinder is a universal skeleton key

370
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,770
very destructive but super effective

371
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,120
battery-powered preferably okay so and

372
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,250
then physical security if you've got

373
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,550
some human security in your way we did

374
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,410
one pen test where sometimes people

375
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,959
would come in angry to reception

376
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:17,490
so they contracted with the city and the

377
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:21,720
city provided a police officer to act as

378
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,760
receptionist and play that role so when

379
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,040
we walked in you walk through the

380
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,610
entryway and there's police officer

381
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,380
taser 9 millimeter or whatever he had

382
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,779
body armor like the whole deal likes

383
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,790
pretty intimidating and now you have to

384
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,110
talk your way you nervous already

385
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,149
because this guy's already he's

386
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,380
skeptical of everyone which is great

387
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:46,029
right that's a great trait for law

388
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,589
enforcement but then also you got to try

389
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:52,540
and get through him to where you need to

390
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:54,040
go spoiler we got through but it was a

391
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,139
little nerve-wracking because he's got

392
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,769
guns and stuff right and I don't want to

393
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,870
and handcuffs it'll sound unpleasant ok

394
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:06,810
so the reason why most of these tools

395
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,810
are gonna talk about work are because of

396
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,850
the Americans with Disabilities Act

397
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:14,859
which i think is great I'm glad that it

398
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,190
provides assistance with physical access

399
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,029
I think that was that's needed

400
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,070
unfortunately it's great for providing

401
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:24,189
access it's also great for bypassing

402
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,540
security also it's great for not having

403
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,180
people locked in a building when it's on

404
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,569
fire so there's some safety concerns for

405
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,339
sure but this is most those are the

406
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:39,490
things were going to talk about exist

407
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:42,750
because of this regulation so it's maybe

408
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,339
some unintended circumstances real quick

409
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,519
everybody seen one of these those are

410
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,870
everywhere they go up and down which is

411
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,240
nice

412
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,220
knobs maybe on closets you may seem

413
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,470
occasionally this would be a lockpick

414
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,240
situation unless you can access the

415
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,550
catch which would be which would be what

416
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,720
I would go after because picking locks

417
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:07,629
is hard crash bars are awesome they

418
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,459
always open from the inside out and I

419
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,250
don't believe I think you can't lock

420
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,709
them and that might be a fire hazard but

421
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,369
they help and then doors that open out

422
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:20,770
so these won't necessarily be on the an

423
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,409
exterior door but maybe I've seen them

424
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,770
everywhere but you've got a huge I mean

425
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,470
you can see that's probably an 5/8 inch

426
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,059
of a gap between the door and the catch

427
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,290
and the strike plate and there is a you

428
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,690
can kind of see that there's an

429
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,270
electronic release there so you could

430
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,400
badge in there or you could just stick a

431
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,779
tool in there and open it because that's

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,059
super easy

433
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:45,460
double doors are great you can see light

434
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,869
between those two doors even if you

435
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,729
can't see light usually it's only a

436
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:50,709
weather strip in the way not like a

437
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:53,019
physical barrier that would prevent you

438
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,389
from going through that crack this is

439
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,159
the this is the allowed side the other

440
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:59,469
side obviously is not the crash bars but

441
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,539
still has the gap and then the double

442
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,349
whammy double doors are open out which

443
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:09,729
are my favorite so a lot of these

444
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:12,840
problems come because setting up doors

445
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:15,779
and fitting them properly is hard and

446
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,099
you're getting paid to set this door

447
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,960
you're gonna get paid 300 bucks to set

448
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:23,799
this door whether it's done right or

449
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,690
done mostly right okay and then also

450
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,918
this is probably the worst installed

451
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,499
garage door in history if that guy can

452
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,179
get his fingers in there but also garage

453
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:32,440
doors are fun but not that's really

454
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,779
great for commercial buildings I don't

455
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,450
know they always have these but we're

456
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:41,979
gonna play them anyways okay so let's

457
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,950
get to the tools this is a gym goes by

458
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:45,639
many names also slim jim if I heard of

459
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,859
that before

460
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:49,119
it's just a tool the most the easiest

461
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,619
one to use is the one with the big black

462
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,859
handle on it so let's watch a video

463
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:58,478
about it so it's very thin but strong

464
00:18:53,859 --> 00:19:05,080
it's made of stainless steel so let's

465
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:07,869
see this is a door that actually opens

466
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,549
in but I cheated so for for purposes of

467
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:11,039
demonstration so let's look at that Oh

468
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:17,460
hold on you're not seeing that are you

469
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,460
okay one sec

470
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,658
demo fail out-of-the-box first video

471
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,090
okay

472
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:57,440
there we go okay so

473
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,300
that's weird okay fine broken again

474
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:27,889
right so this is gone already little

475
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,889
help when are we doing wrong

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:53,039
yeah okay oh but that's some power point

477
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:55,250
hold let me do that maybe okay that's

478
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,250
true

479
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:09,500
okay so yeah all right so that's the gym

480
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,870
we're just gonna stick it in there grab

481
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,850
the catch release the catch just

482
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,429
spring-loaded as everyone knows and it's

483
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,800
open so that's pretty easy pretty easy

484
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:25,010
access to that and then so if you're on

485
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,240
the other side here is the other side so

486
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,950
this is a little bit different tool

487
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,740
although it can be used the same way as

488
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,150
the one with the handle see we've got a

489
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,010
little bit of gap to work with there

490
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,060
even if we didn't have a gap we could

491
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,620
still get this tool through it's pretty

492
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,840
thin and pretty flexible and fits in

493
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,879
your wallet which is nice so this is

494
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,889
that will here let me catch it so you

495
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
can see that cut out on the top left

496
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:48,350
there and that is where you're gonna try

497
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,030
and aim for the catch so it's kind of

498
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,320
like the credit card trip trick a little

499
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,930
bit and if you see the bottom of this

500
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,820
card it's cut out so that you can slide

501
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:58,310
it in behind and then pull it towards

502
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,570
you so you don't break your credit card

503
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,399
because the credit card trick does work

504
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,540
but it's easier if it's cut out like

505
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,280
this so I'm just gonna go through the

506
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:11,690
gap and push that catch back to release

507
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,930
it there and then doors open so it

508
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:18,370
doesn't matter what state that doors in

509
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:24,860
locked or what-have-you it's it's open

510
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:28,550
okay no I don't wanna start from the

511
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,750
beginning this is what's the hotkey

512
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:40,190
anyone start from your current slide

513
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:41,270
nothing okay let's try this maybe I'm

514
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,520
gonna go through these and then show the

515
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,500
video since it's so clunky okay so this

516
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,639
is on the settings thank you

517
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,640
[Music]

518
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,330
okay

519
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:07,120
gather we good okay freak all right

520
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,920
this is seed so there's a gym so we

521
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,169
talked about the cutout in the car it's

522
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,110
helpful get a little one get a big one

523
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,480
they've got ones that's go on your Molay

524
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,760
and this is a double door tool so this

525
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,160
is for you're gonna see that I've got a

526
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,450
video for you in a sec but basically

527
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,310
what you're gonna do is you're gonna go

528
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,310
through that giant map in the middle

529
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:31,419
where you can see light turn it and pull

530
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:33,460
on the crash bar it's like a twenty

531
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,720
dollar tool and you can make you can

532
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,970
make one you can loot it make one if you

533
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,080
could like weld which is not hard right

534
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,680
if you'll have if you know how to weld

535
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,350
learn how to weld make one easy so

536
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,730
that's pretty straightforward

537
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,100
this is an o-ring pick has anybody ever

538
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,140
worked on cars or anything that require

539
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,659
an o-ring pick up my fellow car nerds

540
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,520
nice so all this does the tools so you

541
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,990
can get into a rubber gasket called an

542
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,820
o-ring pull it off because it really

543
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,560
slippery really hard to get to we can

544
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,879
get this at autozone or wherever and a

545
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,330
set of four with different kind of

546
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,890
shapes

547
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,300
anyway if you look at it's just a

548
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,340
straight piece of metal it's pretty thin

549
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,360
and with a hook at the end that's it

550
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,459
it's kind of pointing at the end I've

551
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,139
got a video for that in a sec this one's

552
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,490
a little bit more advanced as the under

553
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:17,440
door tool it does exactly what it sounds

554
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:22,180
like which is you can put it under a

555
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:25,300
door grab your handle latch and open it

556
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,790
okay we'll watch that video I think yeah

557
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,899
the rip cord the rift cortex are on here

558
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,980
just because for unnecessary carnage

559
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,480
I've never used this in a real

560
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,440
engagement but it'll open a garage door

561
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,100
from the outside which i think is

562
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:46,150
awesome so let me see if I can do this a

563
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:53,320
little more elegantly here okay get that

564
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:56,970
guy out of here cause that guy and my

565
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,889
finder is gone okay so let's look at

566
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:03,360
[Music]

567
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,360
this is not what I want get one sec

568
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,789
obviously don't work on a Mac every day

569
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,610
I work on Linux it didn't also work on

570
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,179
Linux every single day primary use I

571
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,428
love it

572
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:16,190
very awesome I don't have these problems

573
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,620
with Linux so computer nerd newb I guess

574
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:25,279
of course you can't use PowerPoint in

575
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:30,229
Linux so dang it my skirt is up okay

576
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,429
hold on let's see oh this is my fourth

577
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,750
year presenting it saying kana left

578
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,769
saying con everybody give a round of

579
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,000
applause to everybody that's involved

580
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:41,679
putting on the saint con specially

581
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,539
codebook there yes okay Dumbledore tool

582
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,539
there she is

583
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:53,330
this is not a religious building at all

584
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:55,700
okay so there's the tool then quite fit

585
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,500
there oh it looks like it's a bigger gap

586
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,629
the bottom perfect all right let's go

587
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,240
through I'll feel around to find the

588
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:05,029
crash bar a little bit there it is get

589
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,509
in front of it give it a little tug and

590
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:11,200
it's open so anytime you have I mean

591
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,269
that the bar on that is probably

592
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,690
quarter-inch maybe smaller might be 3/8

593
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,429
so anytime you've got a gap that big

594
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,500
you're in if it's got a crash bar which

595
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:25,399
most of these do for egress purposes

596
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,700
okay let's go like I said it's about 20

597
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:31,309
bucks money well spent most of these

598
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,490
tools you can buy on sparrows lockpicks

599
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:36,320
calm and it's just easy you can make

600
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,419
your own or you can just buy them

601
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,110
because that's what I do because I'm

602
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:49,639
lazy this is the o-ring pick that you

603
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:52,549
can buy at autozone or whatever and I'm

604
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:54,049
on the latch side again this works great

605
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,570
for double doors as well I'm gonna reach

606
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:59,389
in and just turn it and that's probably

607
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:02,299
the easiest open you'll ever have with

608
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:04,039
an o-ring pick sparrows also sells these

609
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:06,500
but they're really like five bucks

610
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:10,309
autozone so you can just buy one of

611
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,590
those they're easy and come in handy a

612
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,570
little pokey so make sure you got your

613
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:17,750
not put them in your pocket and running

614
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,189
around jumping off roofs or anything

615
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,770
okay this is the under door under door

616
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,180
tool from the outside of the door so you

617
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,280
can see this creepy piece of metal

618
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,460
coming out from underneath the door it's

619
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,050
all weird snaky like and actually hook

620
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,070
at first try but think I didn't have it

621
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:37,120
so I didn't pull but a wobble around

622
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,590
well it looks super weird from this side

623
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,520
and then we're just gonna hook that door

624
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:45,230
and give it a little tug great some

625
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,730
doors you don't have and here's from the

626
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,300
entered from the other side sometimes

627
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,490
you won't have as much room underneath

628
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,050
so on those doors this won't work just

629
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,500
find a different door there's usually

630
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,940
lots of doors which is nice turns out

631
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,410
people humans need to get inside and

632
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,620
outside out of building so the other

633
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,670
side slide it under curve already forms

634
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,229
to where it should go

635
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,450
usually cable to hold it against the

636
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:14,330
door once you hook it and then pop the

637
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:17,840
door so I practice that my first time

638
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:20,840
before doing it I practiced it for about

639
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,149
10 seconds so these aren't these tools

640
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,530
you don't need a lot of skill to use

641
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,480
these tools I shouldn't tell you that I

642
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,210
mean these tools are impossible to use

643
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,520
and you must pay an expert think of

644
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:37,730
these now they're super easy that's the

645
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:39,950
upside of just buying these schools are

646
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,720
super easy so this is this is just for

647
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,250
added carnage right this is my own

648
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,020
garage door I'm not breaking anyone's

649
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,410
house this is my serious face you see

650
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,790
that serious and very serious right now

651
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,590
okay so this took a little monkey and if

652
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,060
you don't have glass in your garage door

653
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,169
you effectively mitigate this attack

654
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,419
because you kind of need to be able to

655
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,920
see otherwise it's really difficult but

656
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,650
this slides up and under there's a hook

657
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,780
and what you're hooking is the emergency

658
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,820
latch release that slides up and down

659
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,350
with your garage door so I've now hooked

660
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,730
it now I'm gonna walk around the other

661
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,810
side I want to do one continuous will

662
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,660
roll the camera so you know I wasn't

663
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,860
cheating and then you can see kind of in

664
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,300
the middle there it's hooked on to the

665
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,590
emergency exit or the emergency release

666
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,450
you'll see it a little bit more clearly

667
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,669
soon as it starts moving a sack so

668
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,930
there's the hook I've hooked it and then

669
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,240
I pulled it I thought I got it but I

670
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:28,580
didn't so I'm gonna go ahead and pull it

671
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,910
again and it's open

672
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,439
so that's fun I like this is fun because

673
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,280
nobody wants people breaking into their

674
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,780
garage and typically does anybody go out

675
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
and lock the garage at night that has a

676
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,770
garage door opener please raise your

677
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,950
hand if you do that I like you

678
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,780
you are smart I am not smart I've ever

679
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,150
done that in the history of man but

680
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,680
that's a great idea and that's the only

681
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,840
way to mitigate against this Kotak slide

682
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,420
those little latches across at the at

683
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,580
the track on the side okay a couple more

684
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:03,260
tools how we doing on time I got on a

685
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:05,060
clock oh yes they do have a clock does

686
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,200
that mean I have a half an hour left got

687
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,970
a half an hour left we don't have a half

688
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:14,210
an hour presentation just spoiler alert

689
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:15,410
okay so let's go I think it's this we'll

690
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,810
talk about some extra things maybe do

691
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:23,930
some Q&A though that'll be fine okay

692
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:27,250
well what's that and funny I don't know

693
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,250
how I fix that last time to be honest

694
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:45,590
gathers out of thing window settings

695
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:46,850
nope what if I do this now is just a

696
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:51,560
slide one way slide the other way

697
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:53,209
sorry max they just work okay so we

698
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,690
talked about those things so we've got

699
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:00,520
the gym double door tool Oh ring picks

700
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:04,340
five bucks autozone so gyms range from

701
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,070
$4 to $15 for the nice rubber handled

702
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,020
one double door tools about 20 bucks I

703
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,790
think Oh ring picks five bucks autozone

704
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,240
under door tool that might have been

705
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,639
more like 25 30 bucks and the rip cord

706
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,740
was probably like seven bucks so I think

707
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,820
we're still under 50 bucks and you have

708
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,400
that whole tool set which it's pretty

709
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,960
cool I mean you could bypass a lot of

710
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,510
things right there are a lot of things

711
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,970
we bypass but let's say I'm a college

712
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,379
student and I have no money so I'm not

713
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,270
going to buy I'm not spend 50 bucks with

714
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,610
the tools I got to buy a textbook or

715
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,790
whatever that brings us to our other

716
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,090
tools okay and the first other tool I'd

717
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,779
like to talk about is the

718
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:48,209
method so this method was taught to me

719
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:51,690
by a man named James Pope who may or may

720
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,429
not be sitting in the front row and when

721
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,510
he was in what I was gonna say he's in

722
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,830
the film business but that's not the

723
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,260
right term he was in the theater

724
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,840
business and they sometimes need to get

725
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,039
into the manager's office well believe

726
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,449
it or not the manager's office had one

727
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,158
of those levers that locked on the

728
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,200
outside and but was unlocked on the

729
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,330
inside so what they would do is they

730
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,490
would cut off a strip of film long

731
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,799
enough to go down over the top of the

732
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,360
door hook the handle move it over hook

733
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,779
the handle and then pull it unlock the

734
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,918
door

735
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,720
your and your manager's office to get

736
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,850
whatever sometimes it was probably legit

737
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,820
sometimes maybe they're stealing popcorn

738
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:27,750
buckets I don't know poke classic can

739
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,939
let us know maybe but never legit okay

740
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,890
perfect so this is a homemade method you

741
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,230
can buy a roll of film from eBay this is

742
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:38,870
a trailer for the prestige I think that

743
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,870
I bought for about 10 bucks shipped I

744
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,370
don't know this guy eBay had a ton -

745
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,439
okay so I mean Pope may have film for

746
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,989
you if you buddy up to them otherwise

747
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,850
you get a trailer on eBay for 10 bucks I

748
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,409
want to get the prestige because it's

749
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,199
kind of like magic right they also had

750
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:57,899
like Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella some

751
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,270
other stuff anyway it's just film for a

752
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:02,100
projector that's it it's not super it's

753
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:05,250
super strong is it mylar so what it's

754
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,070
made of mylar milos with polyester so

755
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,630
super-strong you can't rip it which is

756
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,549
why it makes a great film okay we'll go

757
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,000
I've got a video for that in a sec this

758
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,000
is a ladle

759
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:22,049
it's a ladle I'll leave it there okay

760
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,750
we'll talk about that and then this is

761
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:26,490
it this is a camera they can fit the the

762
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,320
lens the fat end of that lens is

763
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,360
probably about half an inch so if you've

764
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,639
got half an inch of a gap somewhere or

765
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,799
if you want to go up and over ceiling

766
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,649
tiles or you just want to get a better

767
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,330
view of what you're doing this may fit

768
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,639
under the door it may fit through a

769
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,710
crack it may fit somewhere else that the

770
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,899
these are I think they're about 50 bucks

771
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,640
on Amazon get an app for your phone

772
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,379
shows you the live feed on your phone

773
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,450
you can take photos it's got a light on

774
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,899
it so if it's dark you can turn the

775
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,899
light on

776
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:56,100
you've got lit camera view of wherever

777
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,899
you can snake this thing into

778
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,370
super valuable if you don't know what

779
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,210
you're up against on the back side of

780
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,830
the door it's night lights are off but

781
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,010
just super easy I think I called a

782
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,080
borescope is the technical term plumbers

783
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,120
put them down your toilet and pipes

784
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,290
I think proctologist use them for other

785
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,239
things but super valuable super easy

786
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,889
I mean Amazon 50 bucks you can have it

787
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:25,080
tomorrow okay probably ships out of Salt

788
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:26,609
Lake perfect and canned air so I'm sure

789
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,489
everybody by now seeing the canned air

790
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:32,070
trick this is a request to exit sensor

791
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,109
and all it does is sense tries to sense

792
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,700
if there's a human coming towards the

793
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,830
door okay if there's a human coming

794
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,949
towards the door it unlocks it for you

795
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,120
and you just push it open some of them

796
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,949
are smart this is actually one of the

797
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,989
smart ones which I was actually sad to

798
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,730
come and get sad and also kind of happy

799
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:50,370
to come against on our last test that we

800
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,860
did that has I believe it's radar

801
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:55,080
something else that senses if there's

802
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,300
really a physical form coming towards it

803
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,370
some of them are infrared which just

804
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,620
sense you know heat or something in the

805
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:03,720
way something is disrupting its normal

806
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,660
view of the floor that it's been

807
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,950
adjusted to sense so this one was

808
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,960
actually one of the good ones but

809
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,660
usually all you need is something to

810
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,820
block that view and you just use one of

811
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,319
these cans of air and in fact the last

812
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,500
pen test we did when I tested this

813
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,120
specific request to exit sensor I didn't

814
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,360
have any canned air and I didn't go to

815
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,759
the store cuz some lazy so Matt and I

816
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,690
are just walking around and I found one

817
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,910
in the office and I just stole it so

818
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,350
that worked and then but it didn't work

819
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,210
because it was the good request to exit

820
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,819
sensors but if you don't have the tool

821
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,530
you need there may be one on site canned

822
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,380
air just sitting on a shelf somewhere in

823
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,690
a common area so these are just five

824
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,010
finger discount that bad boy I didn't

825
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,390
feel too bad they're already paying us a

826
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,380
lot of money so probably didn't miss a

827
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,310
dollar can of ozone buster okay and this

828
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,960
is our favorite everybody's favorite

829
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,450
hacker Samy Kamkar

830
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,180
doing this to a request to exit sensor

831
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,640
through a glass door and you can kind of

832
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,470
see the foam or the the cloud coming up

833
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,509
from the bottom and triggering that

834
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,669
device turning green and unlatching the

835
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,920
door from

836
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,410
the inside even though the human was on

837
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,360
the outside so these are getting better

838
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,620
but the ones with radar are guess what

839
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:21,590
do you think it more expensive less

840
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:23,870
expensive more who said laughs okay

841
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,850
maybe you guys can get together and and

842
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,089
and lock your garage door that guy he's

843
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,470
pretty smart too okay so anyway I'm not

844
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,590
gonna demo that it's like the oldest

845
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,520
thing in the world but still cool and

846
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,830
don't forget if you don't have what you

847
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,509
need there may be one laying around

848
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,970
never enough just look around okay so

849
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,460
let's let's look at some watch some

850
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,950
videos okay so if you thought that under

851
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:51,740
the door tool was creepy coming out of

852
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:55,819
the door the film is even worse this

853
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,149
thing is not my friend Pope is mocking

854
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,000
me

855
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,680
from the front row okay so this is super

856
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,150
creepy I don't know why it's super

857
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,589
creepy it's kind of like some sort of

858
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:14,000
death snake coming over the door watch

859
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:15,460
this tell me that's that's super creepy

860
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,140
right

861
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,910
then you move it around full disclosure

862
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,379
I edited the first part of the video off

863
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,420
I missed the first time but the first

864
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:31,010
time I did this I practice for exactly

865
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:33,200
30 seconds and then got it and now we've

866
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,030
hooked the latch and since those work in

867
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,240
both directions up or down you just pull

868
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,710
up there's the film that's it so if you

869
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,810
don't have a gap under the door

870
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,420
I don't know how thick that film is I

871
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:46,670
mean it's it's super thin like 1/32 of

872
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,950
an inch maybe when you double it over so

873
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,880
you take a length of film it's probably

874
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,689
I don't know do you know the exact

875
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,860
length it's 14 feet long fold it in half

876
00:37:53,690 --> 00:38:01,250
and then give a good crease send it

877
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,780
through like this until I I measure it

878
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,460
before because all doorknobs hit at the

879
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,710
same height right that's regulation

880
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,060
that's a DA stuff all doorknobs are the

881
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,490
same height all latching the same height

882
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,980
so a measure on any latch door any door

883
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,459
with a handle measure it cheat get the

884
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,080
right dimensions draw a line on the film

885
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,030
fold it laughs that's probably after you

886
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,348
fold it measure it mark it send it over

887
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,499
the door to the mark

888
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:27,410
push the top tape down slightly to open

889
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:29,868
up to open up that film so it bit hinges

890
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,749
on the crease slide across slide it over

891
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:37,039
that lat the I can't remember the door

892
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:39,890
handle give it a tug and literally the

893
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,999
first time I got that I missed once this

894
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,410
video I mean I've done it a few times

895
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:48,950
now but it's so easy like it's legit so

896
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,379
easy which leaves me to believe that

897
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:54,410
criminals aren't very smart does anybody

898
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,539
ever thought that it's this stuff super

899
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,519
easy and if you're breaking in somewhere

900
00:38:56,539 --> 00:39:00,079
legit and you had this film and you

901
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,019
didn't want to get that extra you know

902
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,249
charged for burglary tools you just

903
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:06,258
chucked the film somewhere do you think

904
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:08,118
law enforcement is gonna note this film

905
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:10,119
laying in the corner is for in the trash

906
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,769
they're not gonna know what that is

907
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,450
they will now which I'm glad cuz then

908
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:19,669
these bad guys will get an extra charge

909
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:22,029
but yeah so film super creepy now the

910
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,190
ladle the ladles hilarious because

911
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:30,469
completely unplanned I'm with a buddy

912
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:32,960
and we're doing some work at the shop

913
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:35,239
that he works at and there's this cage

914
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,390
door that you can now see and we need to

915
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:40,489
get into this cage doors kind of the the

916
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,569
the Pope getting into the managers room

917
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:43,519
although I don't think he ever did that

918
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:47,150
that was all his co-workers that he

919
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,649
wasn't do something like that so and I'm

920
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,819
like well we need these drill bits to

921
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,440
finish this project were working on it's

922
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,670
like a shop there's some tools and stuff

923
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,690
we can use

924
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:59,450
and I'm like was thing it's locked like

925
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,789
this was probably three weeks ago I knew

926
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,009
I was given this talk so when he did it

927
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,109
it was hilarious now we we recreated it

928
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:07,609
for dramatic effect right but the first

929
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:10,759
time you just walked over grab this

930
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:13,160
ladle and pop the store so this is this

931
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:15,410
is the recreation but hilarious that's a

932
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,700
ladle we're gonna go right up through

933
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:20,390
that grab the handle and we're open

934
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,808
here's what it looks like from the other

935
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,609
side creepy ladle handle coming on in

936
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:27,769
pop that door and it's open in a second

937
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:28,999
now the most hilarious part about this

938
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:32,598
this is probably how it was it the movie

939
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:34,700
theater I would guess is I said we need

940
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,089
that drill bit he walks the other way to

941
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,640
a

942
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,989
about ten feet away from this door grab

943
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,430
the ladle and walked over and did it

944
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:43,609
without even like thinking twice about

945
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:46,219
it but later was there we didn't bring

946
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:49,969
her own ladle I know her the ladle came

947
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:52,969
from but so we put a ladle there and now

948
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:54,079
it opens this door so and I'm not

949
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:57,109
totally unconvinced that the guy that

950
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,369
works behind this cage doesn't use the

951
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:59,869
ladle just to get into his own shop

952
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:02,839
because it's easier than using a key

953
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:05,680
right I mean that's ten times faster

954
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:07,670
than using a key and nondestructive

955
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,859
which is the beauty of most of these

956
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,739
tools right double door tool unless you

957
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,420
scratch in between the double doors its

958
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:16,940
non-destructive they'll never know that

959
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,039
that's I mean if you got like a guy with

960
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,690
the bag fine glass and the crime-scene

961
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,869
people they could probably figure it out

962
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:25,069
oh use the double double door tool and

963
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:28,969
the jury is like what's a double door

964
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:30,589
tool so that's kind of the beauty of

965
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,839
some of these tools is that they're one

966
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,239
they're relatively inexpensive how much

967
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,788
is a lockpick set like a decent set with

968
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,170
the tension wrenches and the pics

969
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:40,910
anybody buy one they sell other sound

970
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,509
I'm here today it's like somebody

971
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:47,960
selling inventors how much are they $15

972
00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:51,589
okay yeah I mean they can go from 15

973
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,989
bucks - 300 bucks probably if you bought

974
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:58,339
like maybe the gold-plated gold-plated

975
00:41:53,989 --> 00:42:00,109
Teflon I don't know but they're compared

976
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:03,380
old pipe compared we priced right and

977
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:07,578
film is free a ladle you probably steal

978
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,749
your mom she won't notice they probably

979
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,680
have them in the drawer at your local

980
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:15,618
religious institution in the kitchen

981
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:19,940
don't steal one that's wrong no one will

982
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:22,940
miss it so you could spend about a

983
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:27,339
hundred bucks on these tools and do all

984
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,960
these things that require zero skill

985
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:31,759
about I mean if you want to be like an

986
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,670
expert practice them for about 15

987
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:36,109
minutes each and that like that's like

988
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:40,059
ninja status right if you want to be an

989
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:43,119
experts probably like seven minutes so

990
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:44,989
and they're easy to use the repeatable

991
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,890
doors are installed and properly

992
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:50,900
everywhere we go and usually are

993
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:54,890
assessments are a report full of photos

994
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:57,760
of misconfigured doors and then it's

995
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,810
always fun to go to the exit meeting and

996
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,400
to go through the report and like oh

997
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,620
this is really nice and bah-bah-bah and

998
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,300
then and I pull out a tool and put on

999
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,670
the table I'm like would you like to see

1000
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,070
a live demo they never want to see a

1001
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,450
live demo okay that's like seeing your

1002
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,580
kid get beat up or something I don't

1003
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,850
know but they they don't ever want to do

1004
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,890
that but it's fun and it's super easy so

1005
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,140
I don't know if that means physical

1006
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,500
pentesting super easy honestly I think

1007
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,730
that social engineering is more watch

1008
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,030
this Pope right ready

1009
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:33,440
swipe was it gone it's gone boom okay I

1010
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,270
think social engineering is harder than

1011
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,070
these tools and using these tools it's

1012
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,230
definitely less nerve-wracking because

1013
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,770
usually using them at night excuse me

1014
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,820
when no one's around and you get all the

1015
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:49,700
time in the world social engineering is

1016
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,290
nerve-wracking and you're always worried

1017
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,480
you're not gonna get in you're always

1018
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,910
gonna get in so if you have this type of

1019
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,700
engagement that's not about worry but I

1020
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,730
still worry about it so whatever a

1021
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,890
couple things that that would be great

1022
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,990
to talk about that I didn't get to even

1023
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,910
though we have a little time but so hit

1024
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,959
26 and be familiar with hit 26 raise

1025
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,690
your hand if you've heard of hit 26

1026
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,700
before everybody uses East for bad

1027
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,140
systems right there's there's very few

1028
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,180
alternatives there's several

1029
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,279
alternatives nobody uses them because

1030
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,359
they're more expensive yeah this is

1031
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,800
probably the slide to take a photo

1032
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,790
it's got links and stuff although

1033
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,350
nothing to what I talked about so it's

1034
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,370
super easy to clone I'm sure that

1035
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,970
there's another I think there is another

1036
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:35,150
talk this week about hit 26 or RFID or

1037
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:37,069
door badges go to it it's super easy you

1038
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,810
can make a long range reader based on

1039
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,670
that link with it's a little more

1040
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,380
expensive you buy the big reader it's

1041
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,690
probably I think that thing on ebay is

1042
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,010
about 70 80 bucks

1043
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,750
you gotta come up some batteries and

1044
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,340
stuff but off the shelf with

1045
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,830
step-by-step instructions you can build

1046
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,530
a badge clone or a badge reader that'll

1047
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,060
grab it from probably three to five feet

1048
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,890
away we've grabbed them in bathrooms

1049
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,960
before somebody at the urinal walked by

1050
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:02,609
on the way to the stall grab it grab

1051
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,089
them in line at lunch outside the crown

1052
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:10,680
next to the your target building that's

1053
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:12,720
super easy I've I don't know that I've

1054
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,899
done one done a physical assessment at a

1055
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,749
building or even been at a building for

1056
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,519
any other kind of engagement that didn't

1057
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,598
use hit 26 like they all use this

1058
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:26,299
because it's cheap

1059
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,440
it works well 100% not secure like I

1060
00:45:26,299 --> 00:45:29,640
would say a high schooler could build

1061
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,869
this long range reader but you don't

1062
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,549
even be to high school or you could be

1063
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:34,829
you know grammar school if you can

1064
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:37,680
solder you can build this thing SPG's

1065
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:39,420
super cool for lots of reasons one of

1066
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,930
the reasons you can if you don't know

1067
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,839
what that is

1068
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:45,058
it reads the data coming off the line

1069
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:46,200
from the badge readers so you get it's

1070
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:47,489
super small it's like the size of a

1071
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,529
quarter you can put it inside of a

1072
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:52,049
reader you could put it you can couple

1073
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:54,210
it with the long range reader it has a

1074
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:56,700
web interface so you could be on your

1075
00:45:54,210 --> 00:46:00,869
phone looking at your web web page from

1076
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:05,160
the SBE walk by somebody know the code

1077
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:06,930
you grab instantly and and and then have

1078
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,879
it to program other keys with and

1079
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,069
program other keys do I'd put a link on

1080
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,960
there yeah the proxmark

1081
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:14,670
so the proxmark there's an expensive one

1082
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,940
that's 300 bucks there's a cheap one

1083
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,529
that's a link to the cheap ones like 220

1084
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,299
cologne hit 26 all day along with many

1085
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:23,759
other types of cards replay them brute

1086
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,349
force you can put in a list of codes you

1087
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:26,670
want to roll through hit the button put

1088
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:30,180
it next to the reader when it hits a

1089
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:34,470
code a real recognizes pops the door so

1090
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:37,739
hit 26 is super awesome because it's

1091
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,689
super vulnerable but also a little bit

1092
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:42,749
of sad inside right because everybody's

1093
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:46,890
still using installing these including

1094
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:49,319
the biggest religious organization in

1095
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,868
Utah use just on most their buildings

1096
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:55,319
just I don't know by experience I've

1097
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:58,410
just heard things about that so another

1098
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,849
thing at key to like system so deviant

1099
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:03,149
olam if you're familiar with who that is

1100
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:05,069
he gave a talk at the Wild West

1101
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,390
something sack I don't know her to

1102
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:07,680
before I'm sure it's in Texas or

1103
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,710
something through somebody else's heard

1104
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,169
of it anyway it's on it's on e-bay it's

1105
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:15,630
on YouTube it's worth 50 minutes a watch

1106
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,610
he talked about some of this stuff and

1107
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,410
then he goes into some of

1108
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:23,030
things like kita like system shows you

1109
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:24,859
his key ring of of keys that go to

1110
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,230
things that are just key to like right

1111
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,730
like have you ever gone to a gated

1112
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,020
community and they've got the panel

1113
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,780
there and you can push the buttons to

1114
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,880
call your friend to let you in super

1115
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,620
annoying throw a key to like there's two

1116
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,940
brands and they're all key to like so

1117
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,700
you buy two keys and you have keys to

1118
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,500
all of them open it bridge like two

1119
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,680
contacts or push a button depending on

1120
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,780
the brand and it pops the gate so

1121
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,000
there's tons of stuff like that gas

1122
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,800
pumps police cars I was at a gas pump

1123
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,180
the other day and now we're not even

1124
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,770
worrying about keys they just have a

1125
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:59,690
tape across where it opens so that if

1126
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:01,759
somebody happens to go out there in

1127
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,070
three months and see the tapes broken

1128
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,880
then maybe there's a an implant on that

1129
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:09,470
on that pump I don't know what the tape

1130
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,660
I don't know what requirement that's

1131
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:14,870
filling but it's a terrible idea

1132
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,839
and then file cabinets elevators so

1133
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:22,100
anyway lots of stuff lots of ways to not

1134
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:24,350
break into things using not by not using

1135
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:29,020
lock picks so that's definitely the only

1136
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:29,020
method in town thanks for coming

1137
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,380
[Applause]

1138
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,779
happy to field any quick questions

1139
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:50,960
anybody has any got a couple of minutes

1140
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:54,410
Pope sweet Pope said there is film at

1141
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,150
the dc4 435 which is another part of

1142
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,670
Utah not here so we're glad they're here

1143
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,859
giving away free film so is that in the

1144
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:05,470
vendor area downstairs so get your free

1145
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:10,790
film 14 feet of free film at the dc4 35

1146
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:12,500
that's Pope's hood I believe who air

1147
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,900
wedges are also good which a little

1148
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,760
rubber pillows that you can just blow up

1149
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,550
and they expand things away from other

1150
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,160
things I didn't think about that that's

1151
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,410
a great yeah all gaps get bigger with

1152
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,629
the air wedge and they're hopefully

1153
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,980
non-destructive unless you like pump

1154
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,660
them up into a Bolivian or something I

1155
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,930
don't know great nice comments thank you

1156
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,930
yes sir

1157
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:45,560
cookie sheets to defeat defeat a gated

1158
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:53,560
system I have not sounds awesome though

1159
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:53,560
go on yeah

1160
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,279
okay

1161
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,739
so on some of the he's saying some of

1162
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:10,269
the gate systems on your exit it's

1163
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,069
looking for a metal to met something

1164
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:13,930
metal above it and if you slide a cookie

1165
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:16,630
sheet that'll trigger that and pop the

1166
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:21,669
gate for you so what's that

1167
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:24,069
Oh anything metal anything metal yes and

1168
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:26,309
are some of a motion sensor are they all

1169
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:29,499
metal okay

1170
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:31,329
yeah sounds like metal works for me

1171
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:35,519
cookie sheets I like it better than a

1172
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,519
ladle even really right I mean yes sir

1173
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:46,328
is it the latch that has like the arm

1174
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:49,960
with the ball and then you slide the

1175
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:51,640
latch over the ball huh that makes sense

1176
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,349
so if you broke the two middle pieces

1177
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,359
out of a fork and then shove it through

1178
00:50:53,349 --> 00:51:00,789
the crack maybe is that the attack I

1179
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:03,848
haven't heard of that specific one I try

1180
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:05,499
not to break into hotel rooms nobody's

1181
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:08,499
paid wouldn't pay me to do it yet so

1182
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:10,299
I'll keep you posted but that's cool I

1183
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:14,189
like plastic forks breaking into place

1184
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:14,190
that sounds awesome yes sir

1185
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:26,369
awesome so and I'll turn it into the

1186
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,470
canned air attack on the request to exit

1187
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:30,420
sensor just blow up a balloon through

1188
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,549
the crack in the in the double door and

1189
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,019
then let it go perfect and I wonder if

1190
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:36,930
that would get the radar ones or not

1191
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,519
that'd be interesting to test because

1192
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,078
those ones are pretty well they're

1193
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,299
pervious to the smoke at least I don't

1194
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,710
know I heard vape works - I'm not a big

1195
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:49,079
paper but yeah anything can get through

1196
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,640
there yeah I mean those things are if

1197
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,980
they're set up right they're better and

1198
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,049
I've seen them set back to from the door

1199
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,970
where you've got most of time they're on

1200
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:58,799
doorframe but sometimes they'll put them

1201
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:01,169
on the ceiling back six feet which is

1202
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:08,160
better the balloon would still kick it

1203
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:09,239
though I think nice nice building

1204
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:16,019
already hot you were already authorized

1205
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:19,220
to enter awesome I like it alright

1206
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:19,220
thanks everyone

1207
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,639
[Applause]
