1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:13,580
all right mmm for the most part we're

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,580
just gonna do on front okay

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:26,279
okay hi everybody my name is Mike Weaver

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:29,130
also known as bash ninja that's that's

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,369
the handle I get today we have a talk

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,260
called hacking on sink on badges but

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,300
it's not what you normally think of

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,629
hacking this is more the program or

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,828
style of hacking like what do we and

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,800
specifically the question that I want to

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,460
answer is what do we do with our sake on

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,629
badges after Shane con is over so how

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,890
many of you have been here to say in

14
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:57,510
calm before yeah awesome how many of you

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,280
have electronics and con badges raise

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,410
your hand if you've done something other

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,409
than put it in a box or hang it on a

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:10,408
wall yeah that's what I thought so I

19
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,080
went to work at Adobe not too far I want

20
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,240
long and I got to the office and they

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,548
have you know the security engineering

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,979
team and they have these these dividers

23
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,640
with whiteboards in them and along the

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,400
whiteboards I see wall like strings and

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,920
strings of lanyards and electronic

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,320
badges and all of these things that sit

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,520
there and collect dust and it makes me

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,350
want to cry inside because nobody knows

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,110
what to do with their badges after the

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,970
conference and we have done so much to

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,649
make these badges accessible to people

32
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,570
but I don't think we've communicated

33
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,729
that very clearly so the goal of the

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,648
talk today is to get the badge that you

35
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,380
got from last year and the year before

36
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,159
and the year before that and pull them

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,619
out and do something cool with them so

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,920
first I'm gonna start off by showing you

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:06,240
some of the the previous year's badges

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:11,310
so the very first sync on I went to was

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,849
in 2016 so this is the same con man that

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,709
I got and this was my badge I had no

43
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,810
idea how to do anything with these

44
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,959
things

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,110
and they're pretty simple

46
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,700
this one has a controller it has a

47
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,800
screen and that's it you've got this

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,420
breadboard area and some things to play

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,880
with there aren't even buttons on this

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:42,899
badge but it does so much so who was

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,640
here for st. Conn 2016 what was

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:51,209
something that you guys remembered about

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:57,359
the same con 2016 badge Narwhal yeah a

54
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:59,820
nice job so so right here we have the

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,060
guy who did Narwhal in 2016 now what was

56
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,880
gnar well well these badges have some

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,489
pretty cool features the same con 2016

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,829
badge it's got this micro controller

59
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:18,870
here this is the esp8266 it's in the the

60
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:21,090
we MOS like board and it has a flashing

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,799
badge and it would you could do

62
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,769
something where you could go you could

63
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,390
register your hacker name you would

64
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,590
connect to the thing over Wi-Fi and you

65
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,380
could register and it would show your

66
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,540
score among other things and near the

67
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,090
last day of the conference for some

68
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,769
weird reason everybody's scores and

69
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,030
badge names and stuff disappeared and

70
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:44,459
they started saying narwhals somebody

71
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,110
hacked the badges and I thought it was

72
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,090
the coolest thing and the badge team was

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,709
so frustrated it was really funny

74
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,660
because the next year I remember talking

75
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,730
to them saying are we gonna do Narwhal

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,160
again it's like no we did so much to

77
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,160
lock that down I'm like sure you did but

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,200
somebody hacked him I was super

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,530
impressed

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,230
after I saw Narwhal I was super inspired

81
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,519
so this is for me my first security

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,680
conference I'd gone to in Utah I have

83
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,298
never touched electronic badges before

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,459
and I thought it was the coolest thing

85
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,419
in the world so I went home and I said I

86
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,060
want to do Narwhal but for myself so

87
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:29,729
they published the code finally and then

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,279
I started looking in the code and let's

89
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,079
take a look at that so

90
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,489
this is something that happens every

91
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:43,439
year is after the conference they

92
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:45,748
published the code for the badges and so

93
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,499
we can just honestly just google search

94
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:55,409
it so I don't even have this saved but

95
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:57,479
we're gonna find it okay so we have it

96
00:04:55,409 --> 00:05:01,849
looks like multiple repositories here

97
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:08,299
about hacking this badge now this isn't

98
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:10,889
let's see this isn't the official repo

99
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:12,899
but in here

100
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,589
different people have talked about their

101
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,209
experience hacking this badge and so yes

102
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:23,389
this is what it looks like I don't have

103
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:33,629
the battery anymore but it looks like

104
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:34,799
let's see if we can find it I'm not

105
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,339
gonna be out fighting it doesn't really

106
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:40,438
matter but what you can do is they

107
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:45,509
publish the code and you can find it and

108
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:48,179
it's usually they put the the github

109
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:53,429
repo somewhere on the badge itself so

110
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:55,979
like if we look at this year's badge you

111
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:58,529
can see that we've got a github repo

112
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,019
repo linked to the badge for this year

113
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,360
and so I went to the badge for 2016

114
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,229
looked at the code and said I have no

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,249
idea what I'm doing

116
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,769
and it was complicated and it didn't

117
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:13,649
make any sense and it was in Arduino and

118
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,839
I was lost so I went to youtube when you

119
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,419
kind of figure it out and I was super

120
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,219
proud of myself and I built something

121
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,679
with my badge and I kind of want to take

122
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:24,899
a second and show you so this was my

123
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:29,638
very first thing that I did with my st.

124
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:33,269
Conn badge in 2016 is I built this

125
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,099
little font here and I added an extra

126
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,319
feature to take text and turn it into

127
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,119
the little keys and then I put a screen

128
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,379
on it I thought that was the coolest

129
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:45,590
thing because they gave us this esp8266

130
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:48,020
and this is a super generic chip

131
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,700
everybody uses like I can go to google

132
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,820
and type the esp8266 projects and

133
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,430
there's judges pages and pages and pages

134
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:02,120
of people doing projects with the chips

135
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,880
for these boards so cool I added a

136
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,800
screen to it they didn't then woody what

137
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,260
did I do well I was like I don't really

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,090
know what to do with this and in

139
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,440
February my work decided to a

140
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,380
Valentine's Day thing

141
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,730
so I took my electronic badge and we

142
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,219
were doing a contest for make little

143
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,730
boxes to do Valentine's gifts and I

144
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,860
turned it into a little Valentine's box

145
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:30,410
kind of weird but whatever it's what I

146
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,690
did so you can see here this is this is

147
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,480
when I worked for hirevue and I did a

148
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,460
lot so you can see the the guts of the

149
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,740
badge here you can see we've got our

150
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,479
screen we've got the little screen that

151
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,910
I added and then you got your esp8266

152
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,580
and one of the cool things that you can

153
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,590
do with these badges is you can create

154
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,349
Wi-Fi hotspots because they walk over

155
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,700
Wi-Fi so I created a little ap I put the

156
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,840
name there and people would connect to

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,969
it and would hijack all their

158
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,960
connections and just put a big heart on

159
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,780
all the web pages they went to not super

160
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,489
useful but it was really fun and I

161
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,039
learned a lot and it was not hanging on

162
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,020
my wall it was actually hanging on our

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,230
little office door you know making

164
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,120
stupid Wi-Fi hotspots so you go through

165
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,830
and click stuff so I thought that was

166
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,720
super fun

167
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,530
it was super basic one of the first

168
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,150
things I'd ever done but it got me

169
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:33,890
really excited about these badge hacking

170
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:36,740
things so the next year the badge team

171
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,510
gave us something super super cool let

172
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,159
me see if I can show you so this is

173
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,020
Satan con 2017 s badge right here how

174
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,620
many of you were here for st. con 2017

175
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:53,660
ok what is the controller for this board

176
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,949
Raspberry Pi I have no idea how they got

177
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,990
a thousand raspberry PI's

178
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:02,660
okay he say they know people but it was

179
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,819
stinkin crazy this is back in the day

180
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,439
when and it's not even raspberry pie

181
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,959
it's a small one the raspberry pie is

182
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,969
eros when those who were sold out where

183
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,979
you would buy one and you would be lucky

184
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,449
to get one if you if you put on some

185
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,800
sort of a script to tell you like

186
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,769
they're in stock they're in stock and

187
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,569
they got a thousand of them and it was

188
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,149
super cool what was your guys's favorite

189
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,759
thing about this batch

190
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:28,519
video games right so it had a feature

191
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,559
well let's see if like um if you can see

192
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,779
it where you could tilt your badge up

193
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,759
like this and then it would have this

194
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,790
screen where you can do stuff and it had

195
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,279
like this game that you get into we

196
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,230
could attack each other and it did all

197
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,910
over Bluetooth which was super fun and I

198
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,470
love this badge and this was the

199
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,519
bachelor they said nobody could hack it

200
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,829
so what happened somebody got into the

201
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,550
flashing stations changed the code and

202
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:59,149
hacked it that was me but it was really

203
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,979
fun they got really bad at it so every

204
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,160
year it seems that somebody likes to

205
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,410
play and hack the badges so what is some

206
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,839
cool one of the cool projects that I saw

207
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,249
is the saint con labs was taking

208
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,350
people's raspberry pies and they're

209
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:14,449
giving you new little SD cards that year

210
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,759
and you could put an SD card into the

211
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:19,008
Raspberry Pi and you could run Callie

212
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,519
off of your badge because it's super

213
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:24,920
ingenious so I mean the Raspberry Pi was

214
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,420
one of the one of the badges that would

215
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,160
give you the ability to do so many

216
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,259
different things I mean it's a PI runs

217
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,449
Linux it's it's all those awesome things

218
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,569
so what did what did I do with the badge

219
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:39,339
after the conference I hung it on my

220
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:42,800
desk and I went home for about one week

221
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:44,600
then afterwards I took it and you can

222
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,050
see here I don't see how well can you

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,129
see that so if we can get some better

224
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:59,329
focusing all right so the screen is

225
00:10:52,129 --> 00:11:01,569
really dark let's zoom in on that just a

226
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,569
bit

227
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,969
and so what they did is they published

228
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,490
the code at the end of the year and I

229
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,430
added this cool little feature to it

230
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,699
that didn't exist before I made it so

231
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:21,209
you could launch retropie which is just

232
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:23,490
a emulator for NES and all kinds of

233
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:26,518
different games and launch it let's see

234
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:32,939
if it even launches I haven't looked at

235
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:37,199
this in in two years no it's probably

236
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:42,449
broken but you could launch it and it

237
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:44,370
would let you play SNES games so I I was

238
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,258
smart and I brought a video of when I

239
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:53,160
did this and this is what it looks like

240
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:55,499
so it launches and it just starts and

241
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,790
you can play video games and I thought

242
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,499
this was one of the coolest things in

243
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,410
the world to do with the same Khan badge

244
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:04,040
is to turn into a little Super Nintendo

245
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,199
emulator and play Super Mario World

246
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,170
something that I think the badge makers

247
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,660
hoped somebody would do but nobody no I

248
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,979
don't think anybody did until afterwards

249
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,860
when it was a lot easier and we all had

250
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,720
time and we got good sleep and and and

251
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,079
those kinds of things so this was a fun

252
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,360
little project that I did with this one

253
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,569
and there's there's so many cool

254
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,579
projects I'm just gonna pull up some of

255
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,610
the other badges that I have seen and

256
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:36,719
that we've we've had in years so this is

257
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,930
the sync on badge from last year at this

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,170
point I went ahead and decided I wanted

259
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,550
to help complicate Mike build this one

260
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,199
because after playing with the other

261
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,290
previous year badges I felt like I

262
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:51,599
learned enough to kind of not break

263
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,670
anything and maybe be helpful but not

264
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:00,779
super helpful

265
00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:03,479
so this badge froze this badge runs a

266
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,429
similar one to the 2016 badge

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,120
it runs the microcontroller it's called

268
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:12,300
its list is the lalin d-32 but the chip

269
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,679
itself is the ESP 32 which is an upgrade

270
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,660
from the PSP a 266 so did anybody do any

271
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,630
cool projects with

272
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,469
Spach from last year because last year I

273
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,540
gave a talk on how to install software

274
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,110
onto it and to start hacking anybody

275
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,650
build something cool oh I'm so

276
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,330
disappointed so you can do so many cool

277
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,310
things with this one so this badge this

278
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,820
year I took the badge

279
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,839
I took the controller and I decided that

280
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,790
what I was going to do with it

281
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,490
last year was I was going to build an

282
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,520
NFC rfid reader so if you guys go

283
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,280
downstairs and you go to the NFC village

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,140
you'll see there's a wall of readers

285
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,829
that's kind of by the hardware hacking

286
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,720
section and each of those readers on the

287
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,090
back side and I left it open so you

288
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,560
could go take a look goes through and

289
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,270
then it connects to a breadboard and

290
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,089
then connects to one of these chips and

291
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:13,790
so what you can do is you can read a

292
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:15,710
card a NFC card a work badge and it will

293
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,969
talk to the microcontroller and then the

294
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,560
microcontroller has the ability to do

295
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,900
whatever you want you can open things

296
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,000
you can close things you can set it to

297
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,590
change color of your lights things like

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,970
that so there are lots and lots of

299
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,970
different projects that we can do with

300
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:33,080
the badges so the biggest question that

301
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:39,080
I think most people will have is the

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:41,600
badge this year how do we hack on the

303
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,480
badge this year so I've seen a few

304
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,760
people find different ways to hack this

305
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,120
badge I had somebody come to me this

306
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,520
year and say I know how to go past every

307
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,140
single level without actually getting

308
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,160
there and there's a way to hack it but

309
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm going to tell you to offer the

310
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,560
conference but how do we set up the

311
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,000
environment how do we access these

312
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,880
badges and how do we after the

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,070
conference do something fun well this

314
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,010
one is not as open as the badges have

315
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,530
been in previous years because we have

316
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:16,550
our own microcontroller and it's an STM

317
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:20,150
chip and it's not as open and it's well

318
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,849
known as the ESPE 32 or the esp8266 or

319
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,840
Raspberry Pi so setting up the

320
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,570
environment is gonna be a lot more

321
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,640
involved thankfully I'm gonna set it up

322
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,440
in front of everybody and it's gonna be

323
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,250
recorded and you can go home and watch

324
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,920
it and you can

325
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,069
hopefully do something for yourself so

326
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,709
the whole point of today is to give you

327
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,089
ideas things that you can do oh there's

328
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:46,550
another cool project I want to show it

329
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:48,259
before we do that is this one this is

330
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,639
one that I saw somebody do with last

331
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:54,350
year's batch

332
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,050
they built a an automatic plant water so

333
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,180
in here you've got a little soil sensor

334
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,719
you've got a temperature monitor you've

335
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,489
got your controller you've got a relay

336
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,019
to turn on and off this pump and they

337
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,670
built it to water their plants I thought

338
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:11,930
that was cool anyway so let's set up the

339
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:15,529
environment so when the code is released

340
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:20,060
this year this is currently the private

341
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,529
repo it will be not at this link but the

342
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,910
link that you find on the back of your

343
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:30,649
badge okay

344
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:35,089
which is just github.com slash comp you

345
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:38,870
kid mike slash sync on 2019 I'll just go

346
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,850
there real quick so right now he just

347
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,579
has some instructions on how to build it

348
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,800
but the actual code will be pushed here

349
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,709
but if you forget again it's on the back

350
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,109
of the badge okay so in there I built

351
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,719
this little dev guide on how to set up

352
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,889
the environment for Windows machines

353
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,439
because that's what I had if you don't

354
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:02,389
have a Windows machine I'm sorry you can

355
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:05,299
set it up for your environment it's

356
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,859
possible I just don't have instructions

357
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,319
for you because I didn't have time to

358
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,849
build them so get a VM and it works

359
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,760
great in via and that's exactly what I'm

360
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:17,958
doing with it right now so the first

361
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:22,908
step is you need to download this STM

362
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:26,530
software because our chip is an STM 32

363
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:29,450
chip we want the idd IDE for that

364
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:33,830
getting the software is a pain oh my

365
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,490
gosh yeah so you to get it you have to

366
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,320
download it

367
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,200
accept this huge agreement and then give

368
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,990
them your email which was really

369
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,299
frustrating to me so use a temp email

370
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,180
website don't actually give them your

371
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,180
email at the create

372
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,850
the idea so download the software

373
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:54,690
install it and then you'll get something

374
00:17:50,850 --> 00:18:00,030
like this icon on your desktop it's just

375
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:03,440
the STM cube IDE you can launch it you

376
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:07,410
need to create a blank workspace and

377
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,520
then what we're going to do is we're

378
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:14,160
going to download the repo and all the

379
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:23,700
file contents to our computer let's do

380
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:26,010
that real quick oh it's not going to do

381
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,160
it because I'm it's private ok so let's

382
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:32,820
pretend I downloaded the repo and it's

383
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,860
on the desktop here magically so let me

384
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,230
kind of give you idea of how we've

385
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,610
organized the repo we have our guide and

386
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:43,470
our readme and then our firmware and we

387
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,080
will also have another folder here

388
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,760
published that talks about the hardware

389
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,470
which will have the Gerber files if that

390
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,910
stuff you're interested in things like

391
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,010
that but we only care about the firmware

392
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,380
so we open the firmware open the same

393
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,620
con 2019 folder and then we have all of

394
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,960
the awesome files that make the make the

395
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,050
repo if you've installed ID already it

396
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,960
should associate these project files

397
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:12,690
with the project so what we're gonna do

398
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:17,730
is we're gonna close all that I'm just

399
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:21,510
gonna straight up remove it from mine ok

400
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:27,240
so the way that we import this repo is

401
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:32,570
we just come to up here go to file go to

402
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:37,200
import no sorry

403
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:39,060
file open projects from filesystem we're

404
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,860
going to select the directory of where

405
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,740
we've downloaded it we need to go all

406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,199
the way to this same contour 19 folder

407
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,950
once we get here we just select that

408
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,380
folder you'll see that it's imported it

409
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,690
correctly because it'll show up here and

410
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,860
we can hit finish

411
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,250
once that's done you've got all your

412
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,949
binaries and all your stuff on the left

413
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,380
and I will kind of show you how the the

414
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,179
folder you know how the the project has

415
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,110
been organized now I'm gonna show you

416
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,730
guys some code we have an hour and a

417
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,668
half left at the conference so for

418
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,909
keynote if you can hack the badge using

419
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:19,809
the code I show you I don't care

420
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:22,250
so that would be super cool in fact

421
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:25,580
there's lots in here that will give you

422
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,799
different codes that will help you so in

423
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,830
here we've got the it's not organized

424
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:34,220
super pretty I'm sorry we're not very

425
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,918
good at this but we have separated it

426
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,539
into two different folders we have our

427
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,049
source folder which house all our

428
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,210
straight C dot C files and then we have

429
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,918
our include folder which has all of the

430
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:54,049
H files the badge works as follows we've

431
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,880
got this main file here basically this

432
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,370
is the folder that starts immediately

433
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,419
when the badge this is the the program

434
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,959
that starts to immediately when the

435
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,860
Badger boots up and it kind of does all

436
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,169
the initialization here in Maine

437
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,649
including with each badge

438
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:14,419
it sets a random code on the first boot

439
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,730
and it will say that to EEPROM and then

440
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:19,549
once it's done in main it'll pop it up

441
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,190
and stick into the menu so we load this

442
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:25,429
little menu section and it just kind of

443
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:29,450
sits in this loop forever inside this

444
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:31,490
menu so we've got a loop that never ends

445
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:37,850
with different menu options that you can

446
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:41,510
go in and out of so that's the the basis

447
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:44,899
of the code here we we've separated into

448
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,360
certain sections where we've got like

449
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,150
our enigma section we've got our game

450
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,830
section and then the other folders that

451
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,380
you all recognize is you scroll through

452
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,418
the different menu items something that

453
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,840
I would like to see is someone to add a

454
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:03,380
new game that would be super awesome the

455
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,889
way that that we've done that is when

456
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,130
you add an item here all you need to do

457
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,860
is

458
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,220
make the same thing up here and then

459
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,580
call it so here is our call for our

460
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,400
snake game and then it just pops into

461
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:24,928
the snake folder and just starts the

462
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,760
loop and then starts the game okay

463
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,700
so we've got our project we've got our

464
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,039
changes so in fact I want to make it so

465
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,929
that my points on the snake game are

466
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:41,610
huge so right now we start off with

467
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:43,260
let's look we start up so with that

468
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,600
right there is the code for how many

469
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,990
points we haven't snake so if I just

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,270
take that and make it 255 when I start

471
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,850
playing snake I'm gonna start off with a

472
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:58,340
huge amount of points so I'm just gonna

473
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:00,750
save that real quick hit save and then

474
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,799
so this is really weird the way this is

475
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,840
works you you want to build your product

476
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,870
first project first by hitting that

477
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,149
little build button and it's gonna build

478
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,428
we only made a small change so it was

479
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,710
pretty quick and then we want to flash

480
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:19,669
it so let me see if I could show you how

481
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,669
to flash these things

482
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:50,879
hmm we have lost our capture device well

483
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,419
I guess we can't show you on this thing

484
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:58,199
okay so on the back of your badge right

485
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,999
here you have these three pins there

486
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,820
right up at the top

487
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:08,249
they're called ground SW d c lk and SW d

488
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,899
io so those are going to be our

489
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:11,879
programming pins I've seen a few people

490
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:13,708
try to hook them up to serial connectors

491
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:15,539
and other things that's not going to do

492
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:17,639
you any good if you guys want to do some

493
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,379
cool serial stuff and kind of fake the

494
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:23,248
circle you kind of want to hit these

495
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:25,678
pins on the side that's a hint but yeah

496
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:30,059
if you hook up to there that'll be a lot

497
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:35,999
easier so we need a programmer and the

498
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:42,440
programmer that we want to use is this

499
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:48,570
STM link so they're not that expensive

500
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:51,419
so this is so these this is the one that

501
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,889
I use it's a knockoff of the original

502
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,109
one but it works just great

503
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:56,998
it's eight dollars and sixty cents here

504
00:24:55,109 --> 00:25:01,468
on Amazon you can find them cheaper from

505
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:07,559
China and all you want to do is hook up

506
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:11,070
this swd i/o pin this ground pin and

507
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:14,549
this SW CLK pin to the pins on the back

508
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:17,218
of your badge okay so you hook it up

509
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:20,279
there you plug it into your computer and

510
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:26,129
then you'll come down and you'll come to

511
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:27,899
this debug configurations okay so once

512
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:33,509
you've done that come to the the

513
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:35,849
debugger tab and you can click this Scan

514
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,369
button and it will scan the connected

515
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:40,859
devices and you can in the drop-down

516
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,249
select the serial number for your STM

517
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,249
controller

518
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:54,710
that STM link if you bought it brand-new

519
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:58,440
needs to be upgraded so just come to

520
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:01,020
this s/t link download this specific

521
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,160
software run it and it'll just be like

522
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,510
plug in your STM upgrade and then done

523
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,800
if you buy will get one from somebody

524
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:13,890
else who's done this it'll just work

525
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,290
they have a flash utility that you can

526
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,200
use now this is the straight way to just

527
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,240
you build your hex file your binary file

528
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,620
do you want to flash and then use this

529
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,530
to flash we don't need to use this tool

530
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,350
because we built it into the the make

531
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,350
scripts of this but if you want to it

532
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,320
start messing with the flash manually

533
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,240
this is the tool you want to do it with

534
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,050
so once we've set this up in the

535
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,720
debugger mode you just apply your

536
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,180
settings and then you'll just hit this

537
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,660
button here now I don't have it plugged

538
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:54,330
into mine but as soon as you hit apply

539
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,920
it's gonna try to connect and then it

540
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,129
will flash your badge and then you're

541
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,850
done the one trick is turn power on your

542
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,590
badge before you try to flash it once

543
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,070
that's done you can start messing with

544
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,570
the code I've been thinking about some

545
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,629
cool things that you can do with these

546
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:18,780
badges right now we have some awesome

547
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:21,510
Enigma code but we I would also like to

548
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,389
see some cool games the people add-on

549
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,920
here the other thing that I would like

550
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,880
to see is somebody said that they were

551
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,290
going to build a enclosure for the badge

552
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,540
so wouldn't it be cool if somebody took

553
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:40,889
an enclosure made it out of wood and

554
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:44,100
then build an actual Enigma machine like

555
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,890
that around our badge like that would be

556
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,020
super awesome and we've got our crappy

557
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,940
plug board that we've got here but you

558
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,680
can just take those pins and extend it

559
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,230
to something else and use like audio

560
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,000
cables to actually emulate the the

561
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,409
actual plug board that came with the

562
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,669
Enigma

563
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:07,049
I've I've seen all kinds of awesome

564
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:10,669
projects that people could do so if you

565
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:15,090
want to practice with with this badge

566
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:17,039
without actually editing our badge one

567
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,918
of the the tools one of the things that

568
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,559
I would suggest to buy is we hat you can

569
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,080
buy these little microcontrollers these

570
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:31,168
debug boards they they call them blue

571
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:34,279
pills because they're super cheap that

572
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,279
is not what I'm looking for

573
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,870
this is what I'm looking for so if you

574
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,750
if you buy one of these they're like

575
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:49,168
eight dollars or something super charge

576
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,500
even less it will basically get you

577
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:54,899
started working with STM chips and if

578
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:00,120
you search for projects based on the the

579
00:28:54,899 --> 00:29:03,809
blue pill microcontroller not not the

580
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,389
matrix blue pills but you can find lots

581
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:09,750
of projects that people have done and

582
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,380
and we I mean I I would love to see the

583
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,600
different things that you come up with

584
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:18,419
they're all over the place and the badge

585
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,678
team is super open to helping if you

586
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:30,890
guys join the the Utah st. coms you can

587
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:30,890
get here by going to the website and

588
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:39,270
coming to this comms section if you join

589
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:41,399
the and then clicking that link right

590
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:44,250
there if you join the Utah st. comm

591
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,899
slack channel you will have almost all

592
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,730
of the organizers for the conference

593
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:49,620
there including the entirety of the

594
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,600
badge team and if you guys have

595
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,750
questions we would love to walk through

596
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,879
and help you get to where you want to be

597
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:01,140
and to start programming this batch and

598
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,940
yeah that's all I have for you guys

599
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,799
today

600
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,529
does anyone have any questions or things

601
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,490
they like to talk about before we've got

602
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:12,460
plenty of time

603
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,529
so why do we pick that chip we picked

604
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,649
this chip because it's a chip we've

605
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:22,480
never done before basically what

606
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:25,209
happened is at least in my opinion we

607
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,510
have this badge that came from the B

608
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:32,649
side Salt Lake conference earlier this

609
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:37,179
year and professor plum built it off the

610
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:40,110
the STM chips and I got it got me super

611
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:42,640
excited about these these chips and

612
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,199
complicated Mike said this is a chip

613
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,770
we're gonna do and it's very similar to

614
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,470
these

615
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,809
it's it's basically Whelan's fault that

616
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,570
we use this chip because he did it first

617
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:54,039
and we're like that looks like fun so

618
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,439
that's why we use that chip is because

619
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,860
it's it's it's an chip we've never done

620
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,710
before

621
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:08,020
oh good question

622
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:10,330
so kumbhak and Mike went over many of

623
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,908
those in his badge talk talking about

624
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,549
this year's batch are you talking about

625
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:18,340
this year or other years so this year so

626
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:20,320
I would definitely go watch his talk but

627
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,178
it's been a year-long process in

628
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,860
deciding you know what it should look

629
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:30,039
like and what we should do for me

630
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:33,580
personally it came from this specific

631
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:35,770
project so this specific project is

632
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,809
called the ax nope open Enigma project I

633
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,580
saw it a couple years on Kickstarter and

634
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,428
it's something I always wanted to build

635
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,668
but it's too expensive because I thought

636
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:47,710
the Enigma machines were amazing and so

637
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,720
I I suggested that we should do an

638
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,120
Enigma machine to copy one of these and

639
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,010
that's where it came from for me the

640
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,840
there are lots of other parts like the

641
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,539
circle and the things that came from

642
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,340
other places but I really had a big

643
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:05,490
desire to have it in making the machine

644
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,490
go ahead

645
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:11,450
yes so when you flash these you're

646
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,310
plugging this little guy into your USB

647
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,460
port and then you've got the cables

648
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:19,669
hanging out plugging into here to flash

649
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,760
now to flash them at the flashing

650
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,780
stations they are using this USB port

651
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:31,910
and that's what you're asking about

652
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:35,300
right so what they did is they are

653
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:38,660
flashing those over the the USB DFU

654
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:41,210
protocol which is in the bootloader for

655
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,600
these chips so I had to happen is the

656
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,520
very first flash of this had to happen

657
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,040
on these ports and we flashed these

658
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,280
before you all got them as they had I

659
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,420
mean 1300 badges we had a lot of people

660
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,580
assembling these and they would flash

661
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,220
them and that installs some software

662
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,280
onto the chip a part of the bootloader

663
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,680
that then says if you receive data over

664
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,670
the USB in a specific way write that

665
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,230
over the microcontroller the reason I'm

666
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,300
not teaching you guys how to do that is

667
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,830
because if it bricks so the bootloader

668
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,659
has problems because of changes that

669
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,699
you've made you can't recover it over

670
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:21,740
USB you have to do it over those three

671
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:25,610
pins yep are we going to put the

672
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:29,210
flashing code on github I don't know but

673
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:32,120
I think we should so I think I will try

674
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,470
and make that happen okay anyone else

675
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,379
have questions or things they want to

676
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:42,980
talk about okay so what was the IDE I'm

677
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,260
gonna put this IDE on it's here on the

678
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:52,100
guide that will be published but right

679
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:53,990
now it's the STM cube IDE that's it and

680
00:33:52,100 --> 00:34:02,659
then the link is is right there for

681
00:33:53,990 --> 00:34:04,430
anyone to look at okay any more cool I

682
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,130
hope to see some projects that you guys

683
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,950
build I'm definitely going to build some

684
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,310
projects with this year and we'll see

685
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,408
everyone next year thank you

686
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:19,609
you

687
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:19,609
[Applause]
