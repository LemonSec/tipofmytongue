1
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,530
all right how's everybody doing this

2
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,630
afternoon all right

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,240
some of you still sound a little sleepy

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,640
from lunch yeah

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,680
still a couple seats up here see one two

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,430
three you guys in the back want to come

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,840
forward there's two over there this is

8
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:56,440
exciting full crowd so a couple things

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,750
want to talk about first in my

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,699
description of the talk I talked about

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,930
there might be something to help you

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,100
with the hackers challenge there's not I

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,659
was going to talk to the game masters

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,880
and like kind of embedded codes

15
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,980
throughout my presentation they didn't

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,270
get back to me on that so you don't have

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,810
to strain your eyes and look real hard

18
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:22,210
for anything or do you know there's not

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,280
also I've got a link to the slides at

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,899
the end so you don't have to worry about

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,150
trying to hurry and jot down notes of

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,430
stuff it'll all be there this

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,680
presentation for you to check back and

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,100
go and look at afterwards I've got a

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,040
bunch of links to like the wasp and the

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,479
NIST regulation so you can dive deeper

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,420
into those as well as the some of the

28
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,759
hashing stuff I've got the metrics all

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,329
right so my topic is the four horsemen

30
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,320
of passwords I'm Chris Mader

31
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,570
I'm gonna be talking a little loud in

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,398
the mic try one of those ear things

33
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,710
before I kept falling off my head I must

34
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,399
have a small head or something but so

35
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,399
let's get going

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:13,330
not the right one false start yeah there

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,370
we go

38
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,140
I just want a password alright so I

39
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,150
thought about the same should they go

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,820
with like the scary apocalyptic Horseman

41
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,800
or like from the movie and I thought

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,650
well make it a little friendlier and the

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,450
color scheme worked well so we're going

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,520
to take the perspective of these four

45
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,190
different people you've got the good

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,379
site which would be a website that's

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,790
trying to do their best like you guys

48
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,980
hopefully maybe some of you out there

49
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,870
developers you're in charge of a site or

50
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,459
something

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,849
and you're trying to learn alright how

52
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,459
do I do this the right way and then

53
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,049
we've got the users they're out there

54
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,599
they're trying to figure things out

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,930
they're not always the greatest some are

56
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,030
on ball some are not and then you've got

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,950
the bad sights those are the ones we

58
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,620
like read about in the news that they

59
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,140
just got breached no other passwords

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,440
were hashed they were playing text or

61
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,958
they used md5 things like that and then

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,440
of course the hackers how many of you

63
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,150
guys out here are the hackers Wow not

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,970
that many hands interesting

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:29,700
oh there's one way in the back so the

66
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:33,030
bad sides they use weak hashing like md5

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,399
and sha-1 those are fast hashes I'll go

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,280
into more details on those later on they

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,760
don't salt their passwords and they

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,620
burden the users with password rules

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,230
they have low minimum on their password

72
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,760
length it was funny two years ago when I

73
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,888
sign up to do a talk the login for the

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,679
st. Conn thing had a minimum of 6

75
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:59,549
characters for password like I actually

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,849
included in my talk they also have a low

77
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,739
maximum password length some site should

78
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,599
go to a maximum password is 14

79
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,290
characters like whoa that's my usual

80
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,630
like minimum come on here and they get

81
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,289
breached and as you know those breaches

82
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,510
just contribute to the knowledge base of

83
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,459
the hackers they now have a ton more

84
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,079
passwords and usernames to go through

85
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,020
and figure out what are people using for

86
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:31,770
their passwords so we're trying to not

87
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:34,469
be the bad side the users they use short

88
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,780
passwords like as short as they can some

89
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,789
of them I remember one time when I had

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,099
to have a password of 12 characters my

91
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:44,909
oh my gosh I could put 12 characters in

92
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:47,520
holy cow these the same password

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,870
everywhere even I have a couple that I

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,940
use more than ones I know a bad practice

95
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,770
they use patterns in their passwords or

96
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,419
common words we'll see some of that

97
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,979
later

98
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,508
they hate dealing with passwords it's a

99
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,279
nuisance they just want to get in do

100
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,489
their thing check their Facebook or what

101
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:09,239
have you and some of them aren't

102
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:11,818
educated on good password practices we

103
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:14,839
want to try and help them with that some

104
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,429
of them don't care but they need to know

105
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,729
one of our biggest problems is user

106
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:22,049
knowledgebase and I think we're getting

107
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,659
better at getting that knowledge out

108
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:26,459
there to them people are becoming more

109
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,229
aware with all the hacks they see in the

110
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,299
news they're starting to get more

111
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,808
interested in oh I better protect my

112
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:35,789
stuff a lot of them don't use password

113
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:37,259
managers that's fine I've talked to a

114
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,699
lot of different people and say hey do

115
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,569
you use a password manager they're like

116
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:46,229
no should I'm like yes here let me

117
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:49,739
educate you and then another problem

118
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,389
that we have them and even like me they

119
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:54,359
don't know the good sites from the bad

120
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,509
sites they don't know if the site that

121
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:59,579
I'm logging into is just md5 hashing

122
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,949
their passwords and if they get breached

123
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,929
I'm toast or if they're one of the good

124
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,889
sites you know that oh they're using

125
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:08,219
great concretion

126
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:11,549
and all that and even the big players

127
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,709
like Facebook Yahoo Twitter

128
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:15,628
they've all been breached and we found

129
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:19,439
out oh they weren't salting their

130
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:21,529
passwords so it's really hard to tell

131
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,389
who's the good side who's the bad side

132
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:26,308
so hopefully be thinking about that if

133
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,579
you're a site owner how can I

134
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:35,909
communicate to my users I'm one of the

135
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:38,489
good sites so they can trust me and then

136
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,709
here's the good site you got to worry

137
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:43,649
about the hackers protecting yourself

138
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:47,069
from them you got to worry about the bad

139
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:49,229
sides have you ever thought of that of

140
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:51,659
like I have to protect myself from the

141
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,469
site over there that just got breached

142
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:58,199
and now I've also got the user that's

143
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:01,469
using the same password on that horrible

144
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,889
site and my site so now even though I'm

145
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,899
using good hashing techniques the

146
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,390
hackers are going to get into my site

147
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,990
because the user used that same password

148
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,640
on the bad site that was easily breached

149
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,770
so that's kind of tricky you know how do

150
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,610
we protect ourselves from the other bad

151
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:24,000
players and the curse the user themself

152
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,460
help them out and of course we want to

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,070
try and follow good password rules and

154
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,710
practices but some of them are new and

155
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,210
we don't know and by everybody being

156
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,130
here hopefully you're here to find out

157
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,289
and improve your your password

158
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:43,050
strategies so those are our players so

159
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,910
let's get into the rules the good stuff

160
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,400
here's the new rules although they're

161
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,620
not that new I gave this talk like two

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,929
years ago on some of the NIST standards

163
00:07:49,620 --> 00:08:02,460
and that came out at about 2016 I

164
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:04,140
believe the the OWASP though the

165
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,469
applications security verification

166
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:11,430
standard 4.0 I just came out in this

167
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,280
March of 2019 so that's fresh it's got a

168
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,650
lot of good stuff in there there's more

169
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,969
than just like password security in it

170
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,049
it talks about a lot of things you

171
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,870
should do if you're building an

172
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,490
application and other security standards

173
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,740
within it but it does cover

174
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,230
authentication and password management

175
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,630
in there a lot of good tips and those

176
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,880
line up right across the board with NIST

177
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,280
and a bunch of things that they said so

178
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,210
you can study both of these and get some

179
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,929
good ideas on what you should be doing

180
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:46,860
so let's jump into those the first rule

181
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:50,699
is no rules we want to make password

182
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:55,680
policies user-friendly because the users

183
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:58,050
hate using passwords so we need to

184
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,209
eliminate the composition rules that

185
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,270
every site has you need one uppercase

186
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,460
one lowercase a number a symbol the name

187
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:09,920
of your favorite Marvel superhero or

188
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:13,260
something and just a little while ago

189
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,099
the inventor of that I think was guy

190
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:20,100
worked at IBM came out and apologized he

191
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,480
said I came up with this scheme of upper

192
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,590
lower number like you know a bunch of

193
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,590
years ago

194
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,050
I'm sorry for doing it I realize now it

195
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,840
was a bad thing and we'll kind of see

196
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,459
how that plays in later on because the

197
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,780
users like now I've got to remember all

198
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,720
these things and they stick them in and

199
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,930
they start creating patterns and things

200
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,240
that just wind up being easy for the

201
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,910
hackers to guess or crunch through and

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,470
so it doesn't really help them but then

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,240
they can't remember their passwords so

204
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,990
they have to write it down or they keep

205
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,890
it short so that's one of the rules to

206
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:58,950
get rid of just let them put in a

207
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:04,590
minimum length password and if it's all

208
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:10,650
lowercase that's okay so moving on to

209
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:13,830
the next rules allow more characters you

210
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,350
should allow them to put in kind of any

211
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:21,600
printable character they can come up

212
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:23,070
with especially like emoji so many

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
people have on their phones now that'll

214
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,250
just plop stuff in and they can throw

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,710
emojis left left and right on their

216
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,250
Twitter feeds let them put it into their

217
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,010
passwords because you hash your

218
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,930
passwords anyway so any weird coding or

219
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,220
whatever in there just gets hashed into

220
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,719
a nice string that you can store in your

221
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,320
database so you don't have to worry

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,730
about that

223
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,150
you can't sequel inject a hash so here's

224
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,300
a great example this one has Unicode and

225
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:54,120
it's got Arabic Chinese a bunch of other

226
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,939
Unicode characters in there and that

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,890
just increases the number of characters

228
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,200
that the hacker is gonna have to put in

229
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,840
their machine they're used to working

230
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,810
with about 95 characters they've got to

231
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,270
use for their brute-forcing throwing one

232
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,150
of these in there ups the game immensely

233
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,800
for them we'll see we'll see the numbers

234
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:23,189
on that later on another maximum length

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,530
of at least 64 so I've been to a couple

236
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,440
sites where like I said maximum length

237
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,839
was 14 characters you're like well I

238
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,530
want to go like 20 or 30

239
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,060
there was another site that I went to I

240
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:39,030
required 14 characters and

241
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,859
I had at least 14 I think I had 16 it

242
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,829
kept erroring out on me so you must have

243
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,370
on like I'm counting okay I know I've

244
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,040
got at least 14 in there and then I read

245
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:55,410
it again after three tries and it said

246
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,839
password must be 14 characters long not

247
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:02,160
less than more than it has to be exactly

248
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,500
14 I'm like are you kidding that's like

249
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,839
yeah the hackers now can eliminate all

250
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,120
the 13s all the 15s and above and just

251
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,550
focus on that string of 14 characters

252
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,350
like you just want to send these guys an

253
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,689
email and say um hello can you change

254
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,460
that but some of these are like

255
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,710
government agencies that I've done it

256
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,270
with Mike you can't do much with them

257
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:26,310
they've got all the bureaucracy so NIST

258
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,569
their guidance and this was in 2016

259
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:33,869
said to use a minimum of 8 characters

260
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:36,840
does that sound very high anyone any of

261
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:43,950
you hackers out there hash catters what

262
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:46,230
do you think of 8 yeah it sounds pretty

263
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:50,340
low to me too so I'm like why would NIST

264
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:54,930
recommend 800 us from this year

265
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,880
recommends a minimum of 12 okay so that

266
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,589
sounds a little better

267
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,850
I've always recommended 16 in fact I

268
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:05,970
went to an OSP conference 8 years ago

269
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,040
maybe 9 I was talking with a hacker guy

270
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,920
there I said oh yeah at least 16 and

271
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,390
that was yeah eight years ago he

272
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:18,209
recommended 16 so we've got a special

273
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:21,330
little chart here if carry that says the

274
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,970
top million most common passwords by

275
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,250
password length so along the bottom

276
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,320
we've got the the length of the password

277
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,920
starts at 2 and then you'll see it

278
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,080
starts spiking around 7 and 8 and then

279
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:40,650
it dwindles down around 9 10 11 12 etc

280
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,650
so if I'm the good site I'm trying to

281
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,290
figure out what should my minimum be now

282
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,150
on the one hand I don't want to burden

283
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,810
the user with you must have a password

284
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,310
of 35 character

285
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,449
there's no like oh my gosh I'm never

286
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,369
going to this site I can't come up with

287
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,640
anything but then on the other side

288
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,270
you've got the bad sites and so we can

289
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,220
kind of use this gauge here to tell all

290
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,250
right if I'm a bad side I'm probably on

291
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,540
the lower end and so you'll look at

292
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,510
eight and the spike is on eight so you

293
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,449
figure a lot of bad sides probably have

294
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,730
their minimum around eight

295
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,570
so if bad side has eight character

296
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:26,470
password and it gets breached and my

297
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:31,410
user uses that same one of mine if I can

298
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:35,170
up my minimum to maybe 11 or 12 or 13

299
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,510
odds are they didn't use my 13 character

300
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,969
password on the bad site that allows 8

301
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,400
they got lazy there went oh man this one

302
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,930
requires 13 ok I'll come up with a new

303
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,160
one to add a couple more exclamation

304
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,870
points on the end of it right so now

305
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,079
you've kind of protected yourself a

306
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:55,450
little bit from the bad site if you can

307
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,240
change your game up a little more to

308
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,030
make it easier on the user but still

309
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,350
kind of distinguish yourself from them

310
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:06,730
you can protect yourself in the bad

311
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,250
sides and hopefully the users will be ok

312
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,730
with it and and part of that too is

313
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:17,500
education tell them why you're requiring

314
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:19,120
15 explain hey due to cybersecurity

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,520
stuff you've seen all the heck's in the

316
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,650
news we want to protect your information

317
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:29,740
we are requiring at least a 15 1 and

318
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:33,100
also put on your website we recommend

319
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,630
using a password manager and give them a

320
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,420
link that describes what a password

321
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,450
manager is how great it is and links to

322
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:44,829
various ones they can choose from so

323
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,380
help educate them is gonna say likewise

324
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:50,890
on the emoji may be put on there you can

325
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,150
add emojis to your passwords thanks you

326
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,069
just tons of teenage girls you know

327
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,270
smiley smiley smiley heart heart heart

328
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:02,230
awesome password

329
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,689
so reduce vulnerabilities this is stuff

330
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,540
that the bad guys don't do and this is

331
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,920
something the good site will help you to

332
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,160
also protect your site and the users

333
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,110
validate against abandoned lists there's

334
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,819
so many lists of hacked passwords out

335
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,800
there that the hackers are using and

336
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,920
users are just reusing those hacked

337
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,569
passwords so if you can get a list and

338
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,790
they're easy to find out there I've just

339
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,970
a ton of them put them in your database

340
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,099
and if a user uses one of them say sorry

341
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,210
that passwords been hacked please don't

342
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:43,780
use it we won't allow it on our site

343
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:45,880
also password hints and this is you know

344
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,220
I say here put a password hidden in case

345
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,430
you forget yours somebody actually had

346
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,390
one that says rhymes with password that

347
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,170
help them remember their password don't

348
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,790
do that

349
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,370
also the knowledge-based authentication

350
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,189
Oh in case you forgot your password go

351
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,380
here it's like what was the first date

352
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,420
you went to school and what was the name

353
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,430
of your dog that you've posted a

354
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,740
thousand times on Facebook information

355
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,339
like that the hackers can just search

356
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,280
their social media and dig for it and

357
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:22,810
bypass that and get through so take that

358
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,500
option away from them to use that or if

359
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,740
you really must and you really want to

360
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,150
don't give them a set of actual things

361
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,080
to answer like you know your favorite

362
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,200
color your favorite car

363
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,929
let them type in their own and say like

364
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,380
what is the color of the lamp next to my

365
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,180
bed that one you can probably still find

366
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,740
out social medias like Instagram

367
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:50,860
Instagram there's this bedroom oh it's

368
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:53,770
green so just get rid of that two-factor

369
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,699
authentication definitely encourage your

370
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,270
users to use it maybe put a link

371
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:06,910
educating them on what it is and if you

372
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:09,900
can offer multiple options NIST has come

373
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,090
out and said SMS is not safe

374
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,570
we've seen that in the news now with all

375
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,309
the sim jacking the hackers can bypass

376
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,490
that because it sends the text to their

377
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:22,410
phone hackers have already jacked it and

378
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,299
they get the text and now they've

379
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,299
breached the tooth factor authentication

380
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:35,549
so offer the other types there's the

381
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:40,350
authenticators like Google Authenticator

382
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:43,049
and Microsoft Authenticator and also if

383
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:47,730
you can offer Yubikey the hardware ones

384
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:49,290
using the phyto standard I would say

385
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,090
it'd be ok to put a two-factor one but

386
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,149
maybe give them the list of options is

387
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,270
like okay here's the worst no two-factor

388
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:01,559
here's a little bit better if you really

389
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,960
have to SMS text here's the better

390
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,990
option Google or Microsoft Authenticator

391
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,840
and for the ultimate pick the Yubikey

392
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,309
one so maybe give them that so then go

393
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,720
oh well I don't want to pick the worst

394
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,059
one because nobody wants to be worst

395
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,280
right I want to pick the bare minimum oh

396
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,379
I'll go middle ground I don't want to

397
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,690
have to go purchase a Yubikey or

398
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,780
whatever so I'll look into that Google

399
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,900
Authenticator one I use it works great

400
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:33,330
nice and friendly so yeah educate your

401
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:35,429
users give them options and try and make

402
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,000
them do it I know Google is getting a

403
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:41,669
lot better about popping up hey security

404
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,169
alert or security feature that they have

405
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,140
to go through if you just put up there

406
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,340
along with everything else they won't

407
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,919
see it they'll just click through their

408
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,860
normal path and ignore it so you might

409
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,309
need to make it a little intrusive in

410
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,110
their face I still click past them a lot

411
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:02,309
but at least you're trying you know you

412
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:05,070
can give them a chance and that's the

413
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:07,200
important thing help the user to improve

414
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,939
themselves and you'll protect yourself

415
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:15,360
and them as well and then no expiration

416
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:20,960
periods don't make their passwords

417
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,959
expire if you don't have to

418
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,610
because I've done this myself they

419
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,970
create patterns

420
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,500
yes I've used the one on the bottom

421
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,799
password fall 2015

422
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,330
password winter 2015 I was somewhere

423
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,910
where like every quarter you had to

424
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,570
reset your password so I'm like okay

425
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,390
I'll just winter fall spring and that

426
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,309
just makes the password worse because

427
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,860
the hackers have wanted to figure out

428
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,320
these patterns you just increase the

429
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:56,428
number on the end like kitty cat or you

430
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,330
shift things around and so that just

431
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:02,580
creates user fatigue they're like

432
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,199
changed my password again and you just

433
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,320
have to do it every quarter or every

434
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,179
whatever and they start coming up with a

435
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,120
hard time of coming up with good

436
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,419
passwords especially if like oh you

437
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,330
can't use any of the 20 past ones you've

438
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:21,390
had before like after three or four I

439
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,889
forget what they were so I reboot it in

440
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,400
it's like you've used that before ah I

441
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:30,600
have no I haven't say so get rid of

442
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,450
those just keep their password and the

443
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,600
only reason to require them to change it

444
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,240
would be in case of a breach they say

445
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,059
hey you need to go change your password

446
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,250
something's happened that would be kind

447
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,399
of the only reason because until then

448
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,230
their password should be good and just

449
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,760
encourage them to use a nice long

450
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,950
password like I've got there at the

451
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,900
bottom I don't know if that'll actually

452
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,760
last for 10 years with all the quantum

453
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,419
cryptology stuff going on quantum

454
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,789
computers but it should still last for a

455
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:07,830
good long time so help the users out

456
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,530
don't put too many rules on them don't

457
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:14,370
create fatigue but educate them I think

458
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:16,110
a lot of people nowadays they will they

459
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,850
want the knowledge they want to be smart

460
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,799
but they don't know really what to look

461
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,080
for what they need to do you might need

462
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,960
to kind of handhold them through your

463
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,350
process these are some things you can

464
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,179
throw in a couple other items I didn't

465
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,559
get out on here but they're on the wasp

466
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,430
list a lot of sites you'll see now you

467
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,010
can click the

468
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:41,280
I ball and it'll show you the password I

469
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:47,030
love that it used to be like dot dot dot

470
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:51,840
dot dot dot dot okay back back okay I

471
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:53,399
think I did a shift there no denied oh

472
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,649
there's a great meme I should have

473
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,720
thrown in here goes through this guy

474
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,640
putting in his password and saying no

475
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,800
that password is not acceptable no this

476
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,200

meters help them with their strength

490
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:40,409
those are Canada funky because it's not

491
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:43,500
the best judge there's different ones

492
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,060
out there that are kind of less last

493
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,940
year one of the guys talked about one

494
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,220
they have and it looks at their password

495
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,930
not just do the way it does it have

496
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,290
upper lower or whatever but it looks at

497
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:57,780
the actual entropy or randomness of what

498
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,960
they typed in and that was their gauge

499
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,580
of this is a good password that's a

500
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
little advanced maybe maybe you can find

501
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,909
the code for it I don't know it might be

502
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,980
out there

503
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,410
at least tell them how many characters

504
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,200
they've typed up to that can help and go

505
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:16,980
okay I've got about 16 characters or 20

506
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,320
and yet feel good that way so password

507
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,050
meter I don't know what I think about

508
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:28,169
the OWASP recommendation on that but use

509
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:31,700
your own judgment alright so let's take

510
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,700
a look at the hacker

511
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:43,158
so when I was preparing this talk I read

512
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:45,799
about a guy that created a 25 GPU

513
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:49,759
cracking machine and this was a couple

514
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:54,230
years back and he used like I don't know

515
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:56,659
10 60s or some other lower AMD GPU cards

516
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,610
on it and then they come to Saint Conn

517
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:59,480
on Tuesday did we start Tuesday Tuesday

518
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,850
yeah

519
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,149
walk in and they've got this puppy right

520
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,428
here it's like oh dude how many GPUs you

521
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:10,158
got in that puppy oh I think about 25 my

522
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,659
sweet can I take a picture it's like I

523
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,340
want to throw that in my slides because

524
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:19,039
like I'm talking about a 25 GPU machine

525
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:23,029
now he's only got like ten eight only

526
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,309
he's got ten 80s and 10 70s in this the

527
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:30,470
examples I'm gonna go through are for

528
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:31,970
the new r-tx 2080 t is to just kind of

529
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:36,739
give you an idea of where the you know

530
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,600
hacker spectrum could be and you got to

531
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:43,190
realize the you know the hacker

532
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,600
I don't know power out there varies

533
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,809
you're gonna have the guys they've only

534
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,799
got like three four maybe five GPUs

535
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:51,769
maybe you've got the guy down here it's

536
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,649
got twenty five but there's like

537
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:55,909
criminal organizations out there

538
00:25:53,649 --> 00:26:00,379
nation-states they've probably got a

539
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:02,600
hundred and etc more to throw things so

540
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:08,059
this is just kind of a maybe a nice

541
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:13,908
middle ground perspective to consider so

542
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:16,220
let's get into the geeky numbers so what

543
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:19,220
we've got here on the left is the

544
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,960
different kind of hashing algorithms

545
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:25,820
you've probably heard of md5 sha-1

546
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,879
there's also the new shot - of the 256

547
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,889
512 flavor now I've got those

548
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:34,269
highlighted in orange because those are

549
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:38,748
the bad ones at least for passwords

550
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:43,299
because they hash fast they were they

551
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:45,529
were built to do the hash quickly and

552
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,610
when you're protecting your passwords

553
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,929
you don't want that

554
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,928
you'll notice the ones balloon green

555
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:57,490
those are slow hashers they are

556
00:26:52,929 --> 00:27:00,570
purposely designed to do the hash slow

557
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,519
and take up a lot of resources so that

558
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,250
when mr. hacker gets your hash

559
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,350
he can't just blaze through it quickly

560
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,630
you know with millions of hashes per

561
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,299
second and get your password these are

562
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,690
designed for password storage for hash

563
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:18,730
and passwords you'll notice on the

564
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,570
bottom are gone - I've got question

565
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:27,519
marks several years ago there was a

566
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:31,928
password algorithm hashing algorithm

567
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,510
competition argon - was the winner so if

568
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:39,130
you're implementing a hashing algorithm

569
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:43,320
for your passwords find argon - and use

570
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:47,049
it if you can I couldn't find any

571
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,779
hashing or hacking stats on it so

572
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,370
they're not gonna be through the slides

573
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,049
I was talking with one of the guys and

574
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,989
he didn't think that hash cat actually

575
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:59,168
has that algorithm built into it so they

576
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:03,730
they can't even use hash cat to try and

577
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:06,220
crack argon - hashes but there's

578
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:10,240
instances like for example if you need

579
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,049
to be mist compliant argon - is not on

580
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,940
the list

581
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:18,908
for NIST yeah so you might have to go

582
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,440
with something like pbkdf2 in order to

583
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:23,019
be mist compliant

584
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,460
even though argon - is better you're

585
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:26,169
told in this guy's hey Argan twos better

586
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,830
it's like sorry it hasn't been vetted

587
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:34,139
it's not on the list you got to use this

588
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,139
so but still it's it's not a bad hasher

589
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:43,178
bcrypt and s crypt and as you can see

590
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:47,439
here second column is the Killa hashes

591
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:52,899
per second for just one GPU one of the

592
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:57,309
the twenty ATT is so you can tell ya the

593
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:59,879
md5 we can go through 50 what 50 million

594
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:03,580
killer hashes per second

595
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,770
trying to crack it an md5 hash go down

596
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,280
to bcrypt

597
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:12,580
only 27 killer hashes per second so

598
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:18,580
clearly is gonna take a lot longer to

599
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:20,770
decrypt a hash with bcrypt that makes

600
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,110
sense and then on the right i've got how

601
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,930
many if you've got a 25 GPU rig

602
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,939
okay so that'll that will guess it up to

603
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,550
the scale of mid-range of what you might

604
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,720
be up against and kind of through the

605
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:39,070
rest of the numbers we're gonna follow

606
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:40,770
the 25 GPU example so let's look at how

607
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,399
long does it take to crack something

608
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:50,620
using these numbers we're gonna take our

609
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:54,160
25 GPU rig and we're gonna take just an

610
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,120
eight character password and that's how

611
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,770
many combinations three I don't know

612
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,330
whatever the number is that and I like

613
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,370
to make my numbers nice and long so you

614
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,800
can see it you put them down to the

615
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,629
exponential notation and it doesn't give

616
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,700
you the same feeling of like well is

617
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,560
that much different but when you see the

618
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,680
numbers you'll go oh wow that's much

619
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,620
better and then we've got how many days

620
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,350
to crack and how many years to crack so

621
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,889
an eight character password on an md5

622
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:29,290
any of the lower hash ones they can hack

623
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:33,910
that in less than a day the good ones

624
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:38,970
you can tell even the slowest or the

625
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:43,420
fastest actually would be the PDK pbkdf2

626
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:46,720
it'll take one year to crack and a

627
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:50,110
character password so that should kind

628
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,910
of make you feel good about a characters

629
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,129
and this gives starts to give us a

630
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,530
little insight into maybe what NIST was

631
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,020
talking about because they were saying

632
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,850
hey here the good guidelines use

633
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:05,950
something like PB k if you're using that

634
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,810
then an a character password is kind of

635
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,810
okay you had a question

636
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:23,940
what No we'll get into that good

637
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:28,470
question so yeah so let's take our

638
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,940
example a little further so yeah when

639
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,640
you read the NIST rules I'm like eight

640
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,290
that doesn't seem like much but if

641
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:40,260
you're using better hashing algorithms

642
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:44,399
and the other rules eight can be kind of

643
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:50,580
okay maybe on your lower end but let's

644
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:53,640
expand it a little bit so up here you

645
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,850
see how I've got ruled eight and just

646
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:01,380
eight the gist eight is like double and

647
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:07,219
the reason for that is it's not

648
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:10,220
requiring upper lower number symbol and

649
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:13,470
so you can tell by adding those rules

650
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:19,680
you've cut the number of hashes a hacker

651
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:21,690
has to go through by half right so if

652
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:26,460
you allow them to have the password

653
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:29,640
a-a-a a-a-a-a it's gonna take twice as

654
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,310
long to crack that so by eliminating

655
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,160
those rules that we thought were good

656
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,879
and then the IBM guy said I'm so sorry

657
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,200
it was a terrible role I came up with it

658
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,990
we've just increased the difficulty on

659
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,000
the hackers because they know that the

660
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,580
the passwords they have to hash oh it's

661
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,230
got it at least you know an upper or

662
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,840
lower and etc they're following those

663
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,460
same rules and so they've cut out all

664
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,610
those passwords that they don't have to

665
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:01,560
try and hash through like a AAA AAA or

666
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:04,020
AAA BBB et cetera so you can see the

667
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,399
statistics for just cutting out the

668
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,810
rules that doubles the number of

669
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,790
combinations that they've got to go

670
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:13,530
through in the example on the the PBK

671
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:18,300
it'll take the cracking time from one

672
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:22,070
year up to three years just by

673
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,070
eliminating those password rules

674
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,580
and as you can see the numbers just get

675
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,920
bigger and bigger as we go up to 9 and

676
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:33,330
10

677
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:36,740
and yeah so under PBK I don't know I'd

678
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:39,929
go with anion character password to 200

679
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:44,040
281 years if you want to be really safe

680
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:45,390
I'd go for 10 so now those missed rules

681
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,460
kind of start to seem a little more

682
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,450
palatable you know okay maybe it's not

683
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,960
so horrible

684
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:54,480
oh I'm saying 12 they've definitely

685
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:02,490
pushed it the other direction we want to

686
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:04,800
make sure you're totally safe and you'll

687
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,170
notice I cut out like the md5 and the

688
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,940
beak rib just to kind of limit what

689
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,280
we're comparing to so we're taking kind

690
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,830
of the the best of the worst and the

691
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,010
worst of the best to see the disparity

692
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:25,049
between but then we'll go the other

693
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:30,840
direction later on so moving on Unicode

694
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:32,429
and emoji just blows things up so we're

695
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,679
gonna go back to just our length of

696
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:40,350
eight a character password

697
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:45,000
yeah yes these are all based off the 25

698
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:46,980
GPU machine yeah I kind of started

699
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,199
running out of room on my columns to

700
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,550
disco it's like alright you know I've

701
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,529
shown you that I will cut that out cut

702
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,800
that out

703
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,090
so normally character set is bound 95

704
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,710
that's what I've seen

705
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,880
you've got your upper your lowers your

706
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,200
numbers and a whole bunch of symbols

707
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:08,400
thrown in there the emoji character set

708
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,750
itself just has actually this numbers

709
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,940
wrong I looked this up last night I

710
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,740
didn't have time to change my slides

711
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,060
it'll be changed by the times you go

712
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,009
look at this

713
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:25,440
it's about 3100 emojis that are out

714
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:30,450
there now and just by changing that

715
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,360
character set even on the sha-512 you go

716
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,660
from less than you know a year to crack

717
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:40,160
two

718
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:43,549
was a two trillion years so all I have

719
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:48,098
to do is throw one emoji into my

720
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:53,390
password and I've exponentially

721
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:56,150
increased how protected that is because

722
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,430
the hackers if you throw an emoji in

723
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,200
there they just can't pick from

724
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,029
I don't know hackers are pretty smart

725
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,578
they'd probably pick the most common

726
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:07,549
emojis and throw that into their library

727
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,230
and work with those you know the smiley

728
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:11,529
face the thumbs up the heart the

729
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:16,630
whatever

730
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:19,910
eggplant sweet put the eggplant in there

731
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:22,089
but like the princess or the fairy or

732
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,558
who knows what there's a ton out there

733
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:28,880
you use one of those less common ones

734
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,859
and now the hackers they've got to put

735
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,390
that entire character set into their

736
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:35,089
lineup of stuff they've got a grain

737
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,629
through and so that makes it so much

738
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:43,690
more difficult and now if you throw

739
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,690
Unicode in there as well yeah question

740
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,990
yeah it's good don't look at these

741
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,689
exactly it's kind of a magnitude kind of

742
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,118
a feel for magnitude if you look at the

743
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:02,569
statistics that they give you on you

744
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,809
know like hash cat to crack a md5 a

745
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:08,150
bunch of them will show like four runs

746
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:10,039
or six runs and then you take the

747
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,930
average cuz every time you go through

748
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,779
it's gonna be a little different yeah so

749
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:18,140
it's not exact it's gonna vary like you

750
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:19,730
say but this gives you an idea a feeling

751
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:30,230
of kind of the magnitude difference

752
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:31,640
between stuff now Unicode there's a

753
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,289
bunch of different stuff on you to code

754
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,308
out there and I kind of had to pick

755
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:42,230
through it to make it clear the BMP

756
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:46,519
stands for base multilingual plane so

757
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,330
there are multiple Unicode planes to

758
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,009
choose from

759
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,540
the base one is probably what we're all

760
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,980
used to it's got our normal character

761
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,009
said and a bunch of the others in there

762
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:01,380
it's the most common and that itself

763
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:04,080
just has 55,000 characters in it so if I

764
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,680
can throw instead of an emoji I throw a

765
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:10,770
Chinese character in there you can see

766
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,700
how much longer a different is to crack

767
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:17,660
that just one unicode character throw

768
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,770
that in there find something obscure or

769
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,379
whatever kinda like the example I had

770
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:25,290
before I had Klingon Arabic wing-dings

771
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:29,850
that's fun just throw one of those in

772
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:33,150
your password you're good but then I've

773
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:36,029
got Unicode and emoji put one of each in

774
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:40,100
there and you're just increasing the

775
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:43,800
time at least on the the sha-512 from 48

776
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:46,560
whatever that is number 272 you've

777
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:52,040
almost doubled the hashes that the

778
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,040
hackers have to go through yes question

779
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:55,500
right yeah exactly good comments so he

780
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:58,380
was saying tell the users like we said

781
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,240
educate the users maybe they used the

782
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,660
smiley face and the heart the thumbs out

783
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,279
on all their tweets and posts so if I'm

784
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,069
a hacker and I'm targeting them

785
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,309
specifically I'm gonna see that on their

786
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:13,200
Twitter their Instagram and instead of

787
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:16,680
me trying to you know guess through the

788
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,480
entire 2800 character set of emoji I'm

789
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,430
gonna crank that sucker down to I'm

790
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,849
gonna just use these four or five in my

791
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:26,308
character set and get them and so maybe

792
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:30,359
on your you know login page or password

793
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:33,329
page hey we allow emoji try to use one

794
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:37,109
that you don't use very often you know

795
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:39,660
encourage that educate them but you know

796
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:41,549
we can't protect nothing's use user

797
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,430
proof you know but we can do our best

798
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:47,190
try and help them out and maybe even

799
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,660
tell them like on your phones it's easy

800
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,869
everything pops up you can do emoji

801
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,540
windows a little harder I found out oh

802
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,819
yeah I just hit the window key and the

803
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,299
period pops up the little emoji screen

804
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:03,329
sweet I can type emoji in Unicode a

805
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:05,609
little tougher but maybe give them some

806
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:10,520
screens on how to put a Unicode or

807
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:10,520
whatever in there yes question

808
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:22,440
I was just gonna start into that I don't

809
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,300
know I've that's gonna be kind of one of

810
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,180
my next little projects is like alright

811
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:31,380
can I put emoji in Unicode in LastPass

812
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:34,560
or a key pass or etc yeah and then also

813
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,730
part two of that how many websites will

814
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,520
take it you know

815
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:43,230
can I put emoji or Unicode in my

816
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,880
password for Twitter Facebook etc yeah

817
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,290
that's gonna be kind of my next project

818
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,510
it's kind of a look and see all right

819
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,640
how many are gonna accept this you know

820
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,430
can't we use it because if you're gonna

821
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,250
recommend it and say hey we recommend an

822
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:59,640
emoji we recommend using a password

823
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:01,230
manager they load up LastPass they trim

824
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,029
put the remote gene it's like it won't

825
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,150
take my emoji in all this socks I'm

826
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,830
gonna do you know same old thing so

827
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,840
hopefully the the bigger sites are

828
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:13,170
catching on to this and they're gonna

829
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,070
facilitate the NIST guidelines and the

830
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:18,450
guidelines but that's a good question

831
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,110
but at least if you're building the site

832
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,540
yours does

833
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:29,430
alright also we see on the the slow hash

834
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:33,420
at the PBK just throw an emoji in there

835
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:36,089
with the egg characters yeah you can see

836
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,540
the difference any other questions

837
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:41,540
Oh back in the back yeah

838
00:42:51,250 --> 00:43:06,470
yes so so the Unicode is the BMP emojis

839
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:08,240
are the unicode SMP I've got a link to

840
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:12,200
the whole Unicode stuff so you can

841
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,750
figure that out the emoji character

842
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,710
space is actually much bigger I think it

843
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,660
was like 20 or maybe 30 thousand but

844
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:25,400
we're only using the three thousand

845
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:27,560
right now and so how it translates kind

846
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,930
of might depend on your front-end

847
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:34,299
and maybe your middleware weather like

848
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:37,310
dotnet or PHP or whatever but it should

849
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,670
translate into a Unicode character just

850
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,020
on a different plane than the BMP then

851
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,960
like the Chinese and the wingdings and

852
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,930
etc but yeah that's a good question and

853
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,550
I don't totally have the answers on it I

854
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,669
was trying to figure it out myself on

855
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:54,890
the different things like okay so here's

856
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,810
the basics to get you going if you need

857
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:03,730
to dig deeper there's the resources out

858
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:03,730
there so let's take it to the next level

859
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:13,129
the best versus the worst so we're gonna

860
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:17,840
go down to our md5 and our bcrypt

861
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:21,860
and you'll notice on the md5 I increased

862
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,260
my length to kind of compare and on the

863
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:29,570
beat crypt I wanted to see how low could

864
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:32,150
I go and still have a safe password so

865
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:37,070
if I've got a site that's using B crypt

866
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:42,230
and I can stick in a Unicode and an

867
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:44,840
emoji to character password not quite

868
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:47,810
enough that's still less than a year

869
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,670
handful of days but a three character

870
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:56,180
password nine years to crack now let's

871
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:59,509
take your md5 one character length of

872
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:03,149
ten two years to crack

873
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:04,799
so I can say hey my three character

874
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,999
password is better than your 10

875
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:11,699
character password in the right

876
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:17,399
situation and and and that's it all

877
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:19,679
depends and I'll get into this later

878
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,859
there some other parts you've probably

879
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,630
already starting to see the picture

880
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:26,279
there was a talk last year and they

881
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,749
talked about kind of the same similar

882
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:30,779
stuff and one of the guys in the

883
00:45:27,749 --> 00:45:33,749
audience said so what is the lowest you

884
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:37,559
know number of characters I should allow

885
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:42,209
my password and they say I don't think

886
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:46,079
add yes but it was like eight but that's

887
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:47,249
not the full question because people

888
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,529
will see that out there was like oh I

889
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:51,359
can have eight characters no problem but

890
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:53,880
there's more to it than that as you can

891
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,919
see there's what hashing algorithm is

892
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,130
the site using what character sets kind

893
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:02,788
of use and we'll get into the the

894
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,329
entropy whoever had that statement in a

895
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:05,339
minute

896
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:08,279
to show like no you just eight

897
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:12,119
characters of anything doesn't quite cut

898
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:14,839
it so yeah so I figured okay a nine

899
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,119
character password or a three character

900
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:21,049
for character if it's bcrypt with an

901
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:25,279
emoji and unicode I'm safe I'm good for

902
00:46:21,049 --> 00:46:25,279
good five hundred fifty thousand years

903
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:34,439
so this is where we need to educate our

904
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:37,859
users and let them figure out what they

905
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:40,379
want help them to pick a good one they

906
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:43,558
can keep it shorter if they follow the

907
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,599
other rules if they don't well they

908
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,419
gotta there's there's rules they have to

909
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,829
follow and this helps distinguish us

910
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:52,859
from the bad sides

911
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:54,630
you know we upper limit but we allow

912
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:58,369
more characters oh we don't have the

913
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,630
rules which actually makes us less safe

914
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:05,989
so there's there's lots of things to

915
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:08,659
juggle when considering this alright

916
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:12,419
we're gonna get into the trickery

917
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,970
somebody brought up so there was an

918
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:16,720
article

919
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:20,770
ours couple years old they gave three

920
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,529
hackers a big library passwords not too

921
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:28,560
huge I think was eighty thousand hundred

922
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:31,540
thousand remember 13 maybe 20 thousand

923
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,950
these guys were using this one guy just

924
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:39,070
used two AMD Radeon graphics cards and

925
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:41,410
they cracked thirteen thousand in just

926
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:43,000
over an hour now a lot of them were

927
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,970
probably eight character and you know

928
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,460
real easy ones but there were ones like

929
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,799
these here on the left

930
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:54,480
now those look pretty good right some of

931
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,310
them 16 characters 16 characters

932
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,760
shouldn't that have taken him like you

933
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:04,359
know at least sixty years to crack based

934
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:08,140
on our stats from before but it's the

935
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:12,400
entropy the randomness that got them on

936
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:14,680
this and so the hackers are smart I mean

937
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,140
they're not gonna go to all the work if

938
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,598
they can take the easy right out they

939
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:23,109
don't start brute-forcing every possible

940
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,270
combination till the very end and only

941
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:28,770
if they want to get a specific one they

942
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:31,450
will go through their list of top

943
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:34,089
500,000 passwords that have already been

944
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,490
hacked they'll do those and then they

945
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:39,160
have libraries of common words and

946
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:42,160
combinations so they'll start using like

947
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,009
a hybrid or a mask attack or combination

948
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,040
attacks one the hacker was kind of

949
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:54,220
surprised that popped up mom of three

950
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:58,000
great kids he didn't necessarily have

951
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:00,819
that one in his list but later when he

952
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,609
kind of started switching him up he had

953
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:08,530
great kids and he had I think mama and

954
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:10,869
then by throwing those in as almost the

955
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:13,960
character in themselves he popped up

956
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:16,330
with mom with three great kids in less

957
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,990
than an hour probably various minutes to

958
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:25,299
just get that one and so we can see that

959
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:26,830
length isn't king so to speak I even

960
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,200
said this two years ago in my

961
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:33,970
previous presentation that length is

962
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:37,600
king but it can't be King alone even

963
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:42,100
long characters if you don't have enough

964
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:44,230
entropy can get hacked you're all

965
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,830
familiar with thee what does a horse

966
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:52,000
batteries staple correct bunch of words

967
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:55,480
nice and long but I'm sure you know

968
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,940
that's in the hackers list I would say

969
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,610
if you're gonna have more you need at

970
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:05,500
least three more words because here's

971
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:07,630
another thing your whoops your um your

972
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,120
master password for your LastPass or

973
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,340
your password manager once again you

974
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:19,299
want to make it easy for the user and

975
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:21,310
memorable because they hate keeping

976
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,980
track of passwords and all these darn

977
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,200
rules so they want to have a master

978
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,180
password that they can remember so we

979
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,379
usually recommend something nice and

980
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,529
long a passphrase get up in the the 20s

981
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:39,670
with your phrase and that way it can be

982
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:42,640
I have a blue lamp next to my desk that

983
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:46,080
I got from my mom something like that

984
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,430
maybe put a couple numbers on there and

985
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,279
so we need to pay attention to that and

986
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,750
help the user you know if we can say

987
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,700
like we said that thing that your

988
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,040
password strength looked at the entropy

989
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:00,399
and so it would look at these and go ah

990
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,370
not enough even the one down here Shia

991
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,930
LeBouf the users thought they were being

992
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:07,630
all tricky I'm gonna use a number

993
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,819
instead of a letter the hackers know

994
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,380
that stuff that that's built in their

995
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:16,930
libraries they blow through it not a

996
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:20,200
problem so the rules that we need to

997
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:27,339
keep track of are not just length is

998
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:32,589
king we have three kings to have a good

999
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:35,920
hand so to speak the length very

1000
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,330
important king and putting together this

1001
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,540
slide I was actually gonna have like

1002
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:43,240
king queen and Jack but

1003
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:45,759
looking on you know they're all kind of

1004
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:49,060
Kings if we go back to the bcrypt

1005
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:52,750
example with three characters I had

1006
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,910
enough entropy and character said that I

1007
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,000
could you know kind of minimize on the

1008
00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:00,390
length so let's see the long at the one

1009
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,160
on the left of length nice and long

1010
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:07,029
probably still gonna get hacked because

1011
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,730
the the hackers the word password is in

1012
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:12,730
their list so all those characters

1013
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:16,210
basically count as one character when

1014
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:18,370
using their dictionary tax etc the next

1015
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:21,730
one nice and long a lot of entropy

1016
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:24,339
probably pretty good password users

1017
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,350
aren't going to remember that one but

1018
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,810
hopefully that's in there LastPass their

1019
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:32,140
password manager for their various sites

1020
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:35,740
and then just to like beef things up

1021
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:38,470
throwing some emoji and characters that

1022
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,990
one there that's not gonna get cracked

1023
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,129
for like ever

1024
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,509
unless they come to the presentations

1025
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,640
like oh hey I'm gonna put that one in my

1026
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,750
list because there's some guys out there

1027
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,170
they're gonna go use that for their

1028
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:57,250
password don't do it don't use that

1029
00:52:50,170 --> 00:53:01,350
password I just disclosed but you get

1030
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,350
the idea yes question

1031
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:12,339
yes because it would make it longer they

1032
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:16,000
would still use like the dictionary

1033
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:19,180
attack on it but they would have to kind

1034
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,840
of compensate for you know still we saw

1035
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,549
with the 95 character set the length the

1036
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,190
longer make it it does make him go

1037
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:29,020
through it but they might snag you with

1038
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,970
a dictionary attack or a Combinator

1039
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:35,380
attack of the password maybe some other

1040
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:37,870
words but adding spaces I think it would

1041
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,940
be good excuse me because it's user

1042
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:41,859
friendly instead of motion it all

1043
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:45,100
together like we type normally this

1044
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:47,950
space is space my long password put the

1045
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:52,120
spaces in there your hashing algorithms

1046
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:54,379
can take the space character so yeah

1047
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,859
that would help might not be totally

1048
00:53:54,380 --> 00:54:01,210
perfect play gap it adds over the one

1049
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:05,570
two three four more characters to it

1050
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:12,560
makes it easier for the user what was

1051
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:14,420
that yeah right so we're increasing

1052
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,900
length but not necessarily our entropy

1053
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,080
yeah so because the hackers they kind of

1054
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,080
know that

1055
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:38,200
yeah yeah right ello space in G yeah

1056
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:42,050
throw the space in in weird spots yeah

1057
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,160
yeah that kind of blow through it but

1058
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:45,590
yeah that's a good question

1059
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,569
I like it like like we say it's not just

1060
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:55,810
oh it makes it longer so it's better I

1061
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:59,030
have but there's if this and if that so

1062
00:54:55,810 --> 00:55:00,950
if you've seen the movies you know

1063
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:04,660
there's more than four horsemen there's

1064
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:07,220
a fifth one and he's kind of sneaky I

1065
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:10,040
hope I'm not spoiling the movie for

1066
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:18,819
anybody from seeing it there's actually

1067
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:18,820
two movies this guy call him the advisor

1068
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,570
you'll see him on Twitter Lee that's

1069
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,970
where I've seen him on Twitter that's

1070
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:31,460
the main social meeting what I do others

1071
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,140
you'll see him and they go oh hey it's

1072
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,140
over security month here's some you know

1073
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,330
cyber security tips and they're throwing

1074
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,040
out tips like you know they're trying to

1075
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,620
they're trying to help people you know

1076
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,300
that they're trying to be good but then

1077
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:48,230
they throw some stuff in there that's

1078
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:50,660
not good anymore it's bad so yeah we'll

1079
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,060
look at some of their tips a lot of

1080
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,779
different versions of this one treat

1081
00:55:53,060 --> 00:56:00,259
your password like your underpants

1082
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:01,190
change them often no do not change them

1083
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,600
off of them

1084
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:07,340
don't leave them lying around maybe if

1085
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,680
it's at work

1086
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:12,980
yeah don't leave it laying around if

1087
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,690
you're at home it could be okay

1088
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,770
if you have a nice long master password

1089
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:22,070
that you need to remember for your

1090
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:26,030
password manager it could be okay to

1091
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:28,220
write it down and stick it maybe not

1092
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:30,490
right next to your computer but at least

1093
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,529
in a book or something in a drawer

1094
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:36,140
because odds are if somebody breaks into

1095
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,570
your house they're not looking to steal

1096
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:41,180
your passwords they're looking for the

1097
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:43,430
big-screen TV and the the gaming set and

1098
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,770
whatever else they may take your

1099
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,460
computer and leave the password in the

1100
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:50,120
desk

1101
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:52,520
so it's actually okay to write down your

1102
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,130
passwords even though a lot of people

1103
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,040
don't write your passwords down oh no it

1104
00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:02,300
depends again are you at work in a less

1105
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,940
secure area then yeah don't do it but at

1106
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:08,120
home a little safer put it in your diary

1107
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:11,770
or something in case you do forget your

1108
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,770
master password yeah question

1109
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,390
yeah no cuz when they take the TV

1110
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,980
they'll get your password

1111
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:24,049
I thought brought just looking guy what

1112
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:30,460
is this that's probably the model number

1113
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:33,620
throw that away and don't share them

1114
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,570
once again it depends like with my wife

1115
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,759
I have no problem sharing my passwords

1116
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:41,030
we'd share the same password manager so

1117
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,820
like that but other situations no you

1118
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:46,790
don't give it out or maybe you do give

1119
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,680
it out to a friend for a certain reason

1120
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,810
but then after they're done getting

1121
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,419
whatever they need you go and you change

1122
00:57:50,810 --> 00:58:04,370
it so once again yeah question in the

1123
00:57:53,420 --> 00:58:06,290
back yes well yeah so if you're using

1124
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:12,040
the same password across multiple

1125
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:14,210
accounts first change that bad habit but

1126
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,220
yeah if you give your friend your

1127
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:16,640
Facebook you know password just for a

1128
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,500
minute

1129
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,330
and then you change your Facebook one

1130
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,190
but

1131
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,279
your Twitter your Gmail or your other

1132
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:27,250
than you know they can get to that so

1133
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,710
you got to be smart about it here's

1134
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,500
another one that I love once again not

1135
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:35,470
bad it's trying to help them know Oh use

1136
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:37,090
long passwords you know seven characters

1137
