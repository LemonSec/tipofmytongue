1
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:43,120
because I can upload that is not

2
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:44,559
pleasant sorry oh wow turn this is like

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,349
I lost my voice teaching people the

4
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,209
lockpick yesterday so awful hard to

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,559
understand I'm sorry and if it annoys

6
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,680
you that I'm sucking on a horse the

7
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,140
entire time I'm sorry for that but he's

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,530
got to get over it

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,680
I'm Kenan Fesler and today we are going

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,400
to talk about kind of the evolution of

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,920
security in safes particularly those

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,510
that you manipulate open with with

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,159
combinations and we're going to see how

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,260
they changed and how we actually attack

15
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,510
them at the same time hopefully we have

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,420
enough time to go through all of that

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,950
and if you have questions at any moment

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,979
I'm not gonna do like a whole we wait to

19
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,270
the end for a Q&A I like to answer them

20
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,710
as they're there because it ends

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:32,740
I'll have the things out to show you

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:38,199
it'll be relevant we good no he's good

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:42,429
I'll take that as yes ok so this little

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,890
guy here is your typical like

25
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,970
residential I bought it at Costco Sam's

26
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:51,370
Club or Lowe's or wherever lock in a

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,310
safe like a what does the name of that

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,930
company that I really hate sentry safe

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,970
this is actually a sentry safe lock it

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,720
was the very first lock I ever cracked

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:04,240
and the way to start understanding how

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,788
to start cracking safes is to look at

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,400
this potential really low technology

34
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,750
version so back originally who's seen

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,090
like a movie where somebody has like a

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,040
stethoscope and they're like listening

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,560
to it no like on a train and they're

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,019
like we're gonna get the gold bars they

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,670
were kind of in this configuration so

40
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,280
the parts that we're gonna talk about on

41
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,109
this one right here is this guy here is

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,269
what's connected I not the point with my

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,640
finger not my whole hand this guy right

44
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,200
here is what's connected to the bolt

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,529
that's what locks the safe closed or

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,640
open as you can see right now it can't

47
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:42,910
go anywhere because

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,489
will's so the thing that's pushing into

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,710
the Wills is called the fence so I'm

50
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,180
using these words a lot so if you forget

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,720
just remind me to tell you what it is

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,760
again so you have the fence here you

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,130
have the will pack the will pack is

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,660
usually made between three to four wills

55
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,519
but you could make it as big or as small

56
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,460
as you want to it just makes dialing it

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,350
a lot more complicated on the wheel

58
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,840
you're going to see especially on this

59
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,790
Winx is the one you can see different

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,100
notches there are two that are shallow

61
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,010
and one that is very deep those are

62
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,510
called gates the shallow ones are called

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,480
false gates they weren't in the original

64
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,630
safe designs then you have the deep one

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,149
which is the true gate and that was kind

66
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,549
of how it initially the idea worked the

67
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,739
idea would be that you would turn these

68
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,450
all in in such a fashion that you would

69
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:37,239
align the larger gates together like

70
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,250
this guy right here and when you tried

71
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,880
to move the bolt it would allow it to

72
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,010
move say foot open it's pretty simple so

73
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,660
what happened is people who started to

74
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,940
understand how these things worked

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,280
started to see security vulnerabilities

76
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,630
or vulnerabilities in the engineering

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,670
and this is kind of what we do every day

78
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,320
in security as we learn how something

79
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,910
works we see a vulnerability or

80
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,500
something that you can take advantage of

81
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,519
to make it do something or tell you

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,870
something that you shouldn't know or do

83
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,340
and so we're gonna look at how you start

84
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,140
doing it with this guy right here so

85
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,380
when you're going to start going after a

86
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,750
safe it's important that you know what

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,540
mechanics are underneath it and easy

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,180
ways to know how its listed under the

89
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,060
underwriters laboratory um this one is

90
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,750
not because it carries no real benefit

91
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,680
it's pretty pointless if you can for

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,380
those of you that aren't watching this

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,060
stream are seeing my webcam these two

94
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,040
that you can see here are examples of

95
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,740
the groups that they have this one is

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,060
called a group two and so it's called a

97
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,280
group two because how long it can

98
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,390
withstand professional manipulation and

99
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,419
this one's called a group one

100
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,530
technically it's a group one are and

101
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,409
we'll go over why there's a difference

102
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,919
between our and and the normal one when

103
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,430
I open that one up

104
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,719
so if you know which one it is you have

105
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,249
to attack it a different way

106
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:01,310
so the original way that they would

107
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:03,259
attack it it's super simple so what they

108
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,669
would do is because you get to control

109
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,499
when the lever goes forward

110
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,150
well the fence goes forward and touches

111
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,710
the wheel pack you can start learning

112
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,688
stuff pretty instantly as you start

113
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,258
spinning the dial so I'm going to keep

114
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:19,599
this why is it not chilling what I'm

115
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,740
doing now oh you've got to be kidding

116
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:25,128
this was such a horrible idea

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,819
okay so when it says that you yell at me

118
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:29,960
I'll move the mouse to resume okay so as

119
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,580
you can see the fence is now touching

120
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,840
the wheels this is the first

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,279
vulnerability that all safes have every

122
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,258
single one of them from here all the way

123
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,539
up to group one it's the fact that we

124
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,449
can't make a perfectly circular object

125
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:46,188
and if we did it wouldn't be it would be

126
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,830
it wouldn't be cost-effective to then

127
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:50,900
make it mass-produce it so they try as

128
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,849
best they can so unless you want to

129
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,120
spend thousands upon thousands of

130
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,650
dollars for one lock they're imperfect

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,779
this one actually is imperfect on

132
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,758
purpose which is really weird the first

133
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,469
wheel is actually larger than the second

134
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,330
wheel the second and third on purpose

135
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:09,469
actually I should probably tell you been

136
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:12,050
how number them so there's two ways that

137
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,310
people will number wheels and they

138
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,870
either number by the number that it

139
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,009
contains or the number that it encodes

140
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:21,500
or how far it comes from this end the

141
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,149
controlling wheel so I always count the

142
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,740
controlling wheel which is this one

143
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:29,839
right here it's moving all by itself

144
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,129
that's wheel number one when you spin on

145
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,529
these wheels and we're gonna take apart

146
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,839
of a lock a little bit later so you can

147
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,270
see the the next smaller parts there's

148
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,710
just little contact points that will

149
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,378
touch each other in between the wheels

150
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,229
and so as you turn you will catch one

151
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,580
and I just caught one just barely and

152
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:51,710
you can kind of tell that the second

153
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,240
wheel is turning let me see if I can so

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,000
there's this guy he's turning I'm gonna

155
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,360
catch a contact point right there and

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,969
now there's two turning I'm going to

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,969
catch another one just a second

158
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:09,800
there so now I've got all three turning

159
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,249
and this is the second part of what

160
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,870
makes safes possible to crack is that

161
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,270
you can tell while you're spinning it

162
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,099
which will is spinning and so then you

163
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,109
can use the two things that there is an

164
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,719
imperfect wheel or they're all imperfect

165
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,189
and that one is that you control which

166
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,969
one is spinning in order to get it to

167
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:29,840
tell you the combination that it has so

168
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:33,289
with this guy here

169
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,369
if you go and you look on like ksl or

170
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,990
ebay or amazon or craigslist any type of

171
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,550
classified thing you'll probably see a

172
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,629
lot of people selling these and they try

173
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,430
to sell them for the same price that

174
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,419
they buy them and they're not worth the

175
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,419
price that you pay for them originally

176
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,590
anyway so if you can get ahold of one of

177
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,159
these they're they're pretty good

178
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,419
practice the concept down so back in the

179
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,710
first safes what they would what they

180
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,330
found out they could do since they could

181
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,448
control when the fence would touch the

182
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:02,210
wheel pack they can turn it and it stays

183
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,960
in constant connection so it's not just

184
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,150
locked up

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,870
can you tell on the picture I can't see

186
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,299
the picture really well why it locked up

187
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,210
that full escape so when I hit that I

188
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,569
start going okay have I learned anything

189
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:24,049
right now yeah I've learned that on my

190
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:27,319
dial you see the dial in the numbers

191
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,039
okay so I've learned that on my dial

192
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:34,070
I've got a spread right here that means

193
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,039
whatever will was turning has a divot in

194
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:40,870
it somewhere a gate so I actually write

195
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,740
that down and I write down the range

196
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,209
usually it's the middle of that range

197
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,019
that would be a correct combination

198
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:51,969
number so I write that down now does

199
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:55,100
anybody know if I could tell already

200
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:00,620
without seeing the lock which wheel that

201
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:02,000
was on what do you think yeah

202
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,710
is the one I'm turning those that is

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,200
completely true but how do I know which

204
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:10,670
one was turning yep

205
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,990
exactly if he already knows how to do

206
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,810
this because he said pick up so I knew

207
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,760
it was what I would call the first wheel

208
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,329
because that's always the first one that

209
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,340
moves always and I hadn't felt a pickup

210
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,170
of another wheel so what I'm doing right

211
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,880
now is I'm investigating that first will

212
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,709
for any information it will give me and

213
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,210
normally you don't do this with other

214
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,880
types of locks but this one is the

215
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,690
faster way to do it so I'm going I've

216
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,620
got one there and I check how wide it is

217
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,660
write it down and then I keep going

218
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,710
there's that one there and then this

219
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:53,000
one's way wider by like four numbers I

220
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,850
write that down and just a hint that's

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,220
the real gate to see the picture because

222
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,500
sentry safe wants you to be happy with

223
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,120
their logs and yeah right what they want

224
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,600
is the user to be happy so what they do

225
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,130
which is really dumb is they're false

226
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,400
gates are really straight and they're

227
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,710
really narrow but their actual gates are

228
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,010
really wide and the corners are tapered

229
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,810
and if you look at the gate its corners

230
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,510
are rounded that way if you're close

231
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,099
enough you'll actually move the wheel

232
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,430
pack a little bit when you try to open

233
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,050
it up meaning that there's fewer times

234
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,479
that you set the combination and you're

235
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,050
just slightly off that it won't open so

236
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:43,910
they want it to open and I want it to

237
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:46,699
open - thank you and all-defense thought

238
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,750
this was my wife's idea I think she

239
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:56,000
might be here by now I can't tell okay

240
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:58,790
so so now honestly just for the sake of

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,070
time I know that that right there is the

242
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,110
real gate and I know that there's going

243
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,720
to be a number there the fun thing about

244
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,120
your wheels if you number it like I do

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,040
where you come from whatever is driving

246
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,170
back towards the last wheel that will

247
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,529
move one two three

248
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,229
is that the number that it is in the

249
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:22,399
combination is backwards so I know where

250
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:29,480
the gate is unreal one it's somewhere

251
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:30,680
between 74 and 79 and pretty much any of

252
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,209
those numbers in between why should work

253
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,699
cuz it's safe so I know that the third

254
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:39,649
number I have is in that range so I

255
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:41,060
write that down so now the next thing I

256
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,630
can do is actually start trying to

257
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,459
figure out the next number and so what

258
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,439
I'll do is like he said I'll do a pickup

259
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,489
which means I'm gonna turn this slowly

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,410
and when you do a pickup on harder locks

261
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,480
the best way to do it is to do it

262
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,639
lightly and almost so then your fingers

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,310
are barely gripping the dial because

264
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,779
when you hit that pickup like right

265
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,250
there I can't turn the dial anymore for

266
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,709
those that you got only can see my

267
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,810
webcam I'm sorry because I don't want to

268
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,949
keep flipping this right now so I can't

269
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,599
turn the dial anymore which means I know

270
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,029
I just picked one up I know that I'm now

271
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,540
controlling wheels 1 & 2 so what I can

272
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,339
do is I can end up moving wheel - and

273
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll usually on century safes move it by

274
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,449
an increment of 5 and it's because we

275
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,349
were talking about with those really

276
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:30,920
deep wide gates so technically if you

277
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,949
think about it every combination with a

278
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,899
century safe is really a range of five

279
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,399
numbers a range of five numbers and a

280
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,370
range of five numbers that will open it

281
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,730
so when I skip to the next part so I'm

282
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:46,279
picking up at about 25 and I know there

283
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,850
wasn't a gate there then I'm going to

284
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:53,209
move all the way to 20 so I just moved

285
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:56,600
the second wheel five numbers and I know

286
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,329
where the other gate is unreal one and I

287
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:09,040
know that's all I'm going to move did I

288
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:12,349
really just find the actual gate so now

289
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,939
what I'm doing what I will do the first

290
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,889
one was easy I can just tell when I get

291
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,040
into a depth and a gate but if you

292
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,630
notice here I can't check that anymore

293
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,849
because the only wheel that I can

294
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,850
control right now is the first wheel

295
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:31,019
why can't you just do it all the time

296
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,748
photobooth so this is why I don't like

297
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:41,610
max sometimes because nothing had like

298
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:42,660
its own software will work I'm just you

299
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,759
want to stand here and just like keep

300
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,679
moving my mouse I'll tell if you're

301
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:53,879
messing around with my stuff you just if

302
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:56,759
it changes you click or move a V okay so

303
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,290
how we figure it out in the hard part

304
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,720
and I can't really show you because I

305
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,748
broke the key on this one so I'm going

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,819
to turn this around right here where

307
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:08,910
that hole is normally there's a key and

308
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:10,050
that would be akin to like the lever or

309
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,969
the wheel that you see on like bank

310
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,639
vaults in the old movies and that's what

311
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,779
controls the fence at this point the

312
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,029
difference that I have to be able to

313
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,420
tell is the difference of the depth that

314
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,220
the gate traveled now I'm cheap so what

315
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,029
I normally do on things like the Sentry

316
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,240
save is you'll have a lever right here I

317
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:33,269
will tape a barbecue skewer to the lever

318
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,819
so it's sitting really up up in this air

319
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,089
area and I'll put a piece of paper there

320
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,429
and when I know my first set which I

321
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,600
will check where I know I don't have

322
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:46,559
anything on the wheels

323
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,589
I will mike mark and that's like my home

324
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,990
base then as I find other things like

325
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,600
that gate right that first gate I can

326
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,399
also check how deep it went because it

327
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,110
moves I'll do the same thing on the

328
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,339
second so right now I would have seen

329
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,649
that it got deeper because I know it

330
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:06,569
does so that one goes in and you'll see

331
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,610
it go deeper and deeper and deeper and

332
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:13,399
so then you just pick up wheels and you

333
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:17,369
go happily with this safe when I did it

334
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:22,049
let's see it actually goes in in height

335
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:25,350
of one two and three so they they touch

336
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:28,139
in that order that's not always how it

337
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:31,620
goes so then you you kind of what you

338
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:34,529
end up doing sorry so what you end up

339
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,540
doing is when you get to the second

340
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,410
wheel and you work your way around if

341
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,910
you're not seeing that

342
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,469
you're not seeing any type of change

343
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,699
that means that the second wheel is not

344
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,660
the next wheel being touched by the

345
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:47,250
fence does that make sense yeah so that

346
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,629
means you're on the third wheel and then

347
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,430
you've got to roll all the way to the

348
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:53,310
third wheel so you got to pick up all

349
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,560
the way there move at five and then go

350
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,359
back to where you know your gate is on

351
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,689
unwilling and then when you need to move

352
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,149
it

353
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:02,219
go back move it five it's really fun

354
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:09,420
isn't it mister I've done this before

355
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:11,819
oh he's sleeping he's so so kind so this

356
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,009
is the basic fundamental of how safe

357
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:16,290
locks work everybody feel like they

358
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,509
understand this because when we go on to

359
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,449
the next on how they evolved it's gonna

360
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:25,740
get a little weirder okay so really

361
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:27,689
quick fence we all pack wheels between

362
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,339
the wheels or contacts I shouldn't

363
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,660
really say contact point Korean use that

364
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,430
for something else and you have your

365
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,800
dial that's pretty much how this works

366
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,339
so now we're gonna go over how they

367
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,529
changed it because obviously it wasn't

368
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,639
working very well especially since

369
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,139
Hollywood thought that everyone could

370
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,230
break into a safe and they could at the

371
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,959
time so they started making

372
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,310
modifications and the group too is kind

373
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,899
of the first like official safe lock

374
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,899
that I would ever want on anything okay

375
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:07,470
so the first thing that they did is they

376
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,109
changed the fence so this here's the

377
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,569
fence that's the part that falls into

378
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:16,049
the wheels and it has a little nose on

379
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,399
it now I broke my cam so I'm gonna have

380
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:21,510
to show you a cam on another one in a

381
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,089
second now as you can see there's your

382
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,710
wheel pack your fence is connected to

383
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:31,590
this bolt and then as you spin you need

384
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,630
to make it so the gates line up with

385
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,059
that little protrusion right there very

386
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,400
kind of following in their heads I'm a

387
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,049
real visual learner so I kind of imagine

388
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,520
everything that way so if you're not you

389
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,100
need to ask a question raise your hand

390
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,350
that sits there but well the main

391
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,139
problem was safes was the fact they are

392
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:54,730
too noisy in what they tell you you know

393
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:57,190
kind of chatty and what they do is they

394
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,170
end up writing that will pack and that's

395
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,240
how you start finding gates so the first

396
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,480
thing that they decided to do is get rid

397
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,460
of that because that's what you do in

398
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,720
security you find a large vulnerability

399
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,610
and you get rid of it or you patch it or

400
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:17,260
something I just dropped a whole bunch

401
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:20,110
of wheels okay this golden piece right

402
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,780
here is called the cam and the cam was

403
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,860
their first line of defense and making a

404
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,800
safe stronger so what you'll see is that

405
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,949
thing that I called the nose this guy

406
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,530
right here on the top well at the bottom

407
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:38,800
that's writing the cam and while it

408
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:43,480
rides the cam the fence cannot ride the

409
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,669
wheels and so as we go I can't get any

410
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,230
information and also notice I don't

411
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,060
control the fence I don't control the

412
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,580
fence I don't control the bolt it's

413
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,960
literally just this thing that I have so

414
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,780
we have to change how we're attacking it

415
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:01,890
and to do that and talk about it we're

416
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:03,910
gonna take apart one of these locks okay

417
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,830
so another wonderful thing that they

418
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,810
came up with was the fact that I'm just

419
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,939
dropping everything it's been a bad day

420
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,740
one thing that they came up with besides

421
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,760
keeping the fence from writing the

422
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,110
wheels was those contact points so on

423
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,510
the sentry safe you know how that we had

424
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,939
a range of five numbers one of the

425
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,710
reasons is because the contact points

426
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,320
between the wheels when they would touch

427
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,140
they're really thick so you touch on one

428
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,909
side you touch on the other side you

429
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,060
have this big gap on which one wheel

430
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,230
cannot contain a number so you know that

431
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,399
you can just jump these numbers because

432
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,160
they have to make the gate wide enough

433
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,380
to accommodate for that take care of

434
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,550
that problem what they ended up doing

435
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,170
was something really genius actually so

436
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,460
if you look at this wheel here I'm Way

437
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:56,160
too close

438
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,470
the contact point is that little

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,900
protrusion up on the wheel that I kind

440
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,100
of just moved did you all see that so

441
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,100
they made them so they could pivot and

442
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,850
they pivot the width of the contact

443
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,120
point so that really it's the center of

444
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,649
this space right here will always align

445
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,809
with the center of that space on another

446
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,300
will that way you can use way more

447
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,220
numbers and by using more numbers you

448
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:26,129
get more combinations and you get more

449
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,660
precision so they've made it so that

450
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,570
they have more numbers more combinations

451
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,220
more entropy they made it so you cannot

452
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,990
touch the wheel pack so you don't get

453
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,500
the chatter from spinning the wheel and

454
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,090
then forcing the fence in and they also

455
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,740
made it so that you don't control the

456
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,090
fence at all you can't force it to do

457
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,880
anything so how do these things work

458
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,980
well you put in your combination and

459
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,990
then when you're done you line it up to

460
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,080
wherever you're safe manufacturers

461
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,580
decided the nose should be right there

462
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,850
you see if we had all the gates of lines

463
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,129
that nose would drop right into that cam

464
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,469
so it drops into that cam and then you

465
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,050
turn to the right and the combination

466
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,640
dial becomes the lever that pulls the

467
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,760
bolt because they'll fall all the way

468
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,900
down you kick it over it pulls the bolt

469
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,860
moves so what we have to do is figure

470
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:22,260
out a way to make that particular

471
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,159
problem or that those changes work for

472
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,690
us to give us information now I really

473
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,670
like working with the people that I'm

474
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,860
talking with and helping you guys learn

475
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:35,150
at the same time besides just yelling at

476
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,320
you or speaking at you does anybody see

477
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,600
where we could start getting information

478
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,520
from this lock that kind of took the

479
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:49,139
entire old way out any guesses he knows

480
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:51,500
so he's being quiet you could speak up

481
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,500
if you want

482
00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:00,399
yeah okay contact points so as you see

483
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,959
right where I'm sitting right now the

484
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:04,599
nose has actually come down just a

485
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,929
little bit and I'm moving it right there

486
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,269
you see that I'm moving the nose so I

487
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,799
can actually feel that the nose wants to

488
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:14,070
move at that point we call that a

489
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,080
contact point you go the other direction

490
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,668
you call that a contact point now

491
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,799
remember with the original one I said

492
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:24,460
that I'd put that barbecue skewer on so

493
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,859
I could see the change in depth well at

494
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,389
this point right now and I really wish I

495
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,489
could show you that it's really hard

496
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:33,178
with these things to show you that

497
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:37,149
what's happening is when it's in the cam

498
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:39,879
the offense is actually sitting on the

499
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:42,518
will because it would have to fall into

500
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:45,549
the gate to go all the way down so right

501
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,859
now this is the only point while we're

502
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,149
trying to crack the safe that we

503
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:51,699
actually get the information about the

504
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:54,668
wheels and the gates right here which on

505
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,929
these dials and most aisles is zero you

506
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,989
usually go back to zero that's where the

507
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,509
camel let you drop down so this makes it

508
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:03,820
really fun where with the original one

509
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:06,220
you would find a gate and then you would

510
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,720
move pick up a wheel try to find the

511
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,789
gate and you go back to that first

512
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,479
number that you had so you can check the

513
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,940
change of depth

514
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:16,570
well now you can kind of have to do that

515
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,249
here so what we end up doing to crack

516
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,519
this is we're going to have to

517
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:24,820
investigate the wheels go back to zero

518
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:30,909
and check the depth and so you do that

519
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:32,470
all by looking at the dial numbers so

520
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,999
how you would normally do it actually

521
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:40,989
would turn this way so you can kind of I

522
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:42,609
don't care I know okay so the very first

523
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:45,210
thing that you do and I'm gonna have to

524
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:48,129
change this thing so you can see my iPad

525
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:57,159
so this is where it gets complicated who

526
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:58,879
likes math I love math who's a visual

527
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,240
kind of person

528
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,040
okay good you'll like this then so how I

529
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,480
do it and how most everybody I don't

530
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,649
know if there's any other way have you

531
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,090
ever seen able to use something beside

532
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:16,120
the graph okay good because I can't

533
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,120
think of a better way is to use what

534
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,909
that's robbers do and card counters

535
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:29,100
because they're the only ones that can

536
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:30,869
do it okay

537
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,639
so what you do and so we saw that

538
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,080
there's contact points if you want me to

539
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,008
show you some of this stuff on the lock

540
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,629
just let me know

541
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,299
but I'm gonna kind of play theater of

542
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:40,199
the mind at the moment because I didn't

543
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,489
want to make a slide where I could

544
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,269
change this all the time so I use paper

545
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:47,609
cuz I'm old-school okay so what you need

546
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,980
to do is you need to start keeping track

547
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:52,408
of those contact points the wider they

548
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,720
are apart in your numbers the higher

549
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:56,519
that nose is which means the offense is

550
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,769
riding high and you want the fence ride

551
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,330
low so the where I start is let's make

552
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:06,210
you guys all spin around and make people

553
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,999
sick I will show this to you right now

554
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,529
okay cool

555
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:13,710
so this how I map it out and that is

556
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:15,929
really Wiggly I apologize I was not that

557
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,210
prepared I guess oh you should take a

558
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,830
picture of it oh hold that hold that

559
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:31,100
right there

560
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:31,100
yes move it to the left no perfect no

561
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,779
cheese okay actually apologize anything

562
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:42,779
think about the fact that what did you

563
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:46,139
do oh let's do this you're gonna see all

564
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:51,090
my pictures that's being recorded oh my

565
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:54,508
goodness you're fine I don't really care

566
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,559
if I have pictures on here I'd be

567
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:57,299
surprised actually

568
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:05,330
besides that apparently that one didn't

569
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:05,330
work either wonderful on the photo booth

570
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:10,939
and it looks like it's the right way

571
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:16,850
around oh you're such a good person

572
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:21,989
alright okay so this is my normal layout

573
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:23,129
so how it works and I wish I could kind

574
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:24,989
of point things out so I'm gonna try to

575
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:27,059
be really descriptive for anybody that's

576
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:28,950
watching this video and help you guys

577
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,509
kind of follow in the top left-hand

578
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,669
corner you can see that there's a zero

579
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:33,550
and then coming down vertically there's

580
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,140
a dash

581
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,110
go down to the second one where it says

582
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:43,330
RC that is where I write the number for

583
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,889
the right contact point and so what

584
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,439
we're going to do is when we said this

585
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,290
is called an all will graph so you're

586
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,610
just gonna spin the you're gonna spin

587
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,500
the lock like crazy that's gonna pick up

588
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,810
all three wheels and so I'm gonna move

589
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,260
all three wheels every time the entire

590
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,580
time

591
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,440
well I'm graphing the very first set

592
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:04,689
everybody good with that cool so we're

593
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,730
going to go to zero which we're gonna go

594
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,770
across vertically we're gonna move all

595
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,540
the wheels to zero and then we're gonna

596
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,800
go back to zero but we're already there

597
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,430
and we're going to measure the contact

598
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,260
points we're going to figure out that

599
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,350
range that we've got so you go to the

600
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:23,020
right contact point which will say on

601
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,520
this one is like a six and then we're

602
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,080
going to go to the left contact point

603
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:31,270
and we'll say that it's like what 98

604
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,460
okay so the left contact point is going

605
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,050
to be graphed down on the bottom and now

606
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,800
I feel really stupid that I didn't make

607
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:40,710
us lie to this I apologize because I'm

608
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,240
gonna take another picture in a second

609
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,490
unless you want to come in hold a thing

610
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,760
still for me hey V I should really learn

611
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:54,310
your name what's your name Kenneth Tyler

612
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:57,370
Wow Thank You Tyler if you start getting

613
00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:01,060
sick people let me know so you've got

614
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:04,479
six and you have 98 so what we're going

615
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:12,730
to do is make a scale so here I usually

616
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:15,300
will go one up and one down I'm really

617
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,300
following that

618
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,909
we're gonna have to take pictures now

619
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:29,360
it's upside down good job Tyler

620
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,770
but I think they understand that I need

621
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,929
to do one more line with theoretical

622
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,430
what it could be you'll understand what

623
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,160
it means and then I won't make you guys

624
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,380
look at this again okay so I now know

625
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,510
that the contact point normally starts

626
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,880
at zero at six and then goes to the left

627
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,070
hand side at 98 so I make sure that I

628
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,860
pick up all the wheels and I moved to

629
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,750
five and then I measure it and I see

630
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,699
where the right contact point is now I

631
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,230
do these in fourths is how I normally

632
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,300
measure I go to the closest fourth

633
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,220
because that's what graph paper will let

634
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:03,050
me fit so if it was six and a half I

635
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,730
would come up there six took point two

636
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,430
five six and a half and I'd mark a

637
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:11,000
little about right there and I do the

638
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,620
same with this down here I don't know

639
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,720
why I would what's this thing it's

640
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,000
bigger it's a really bad wheel so I'm

641
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,280
not thinking there and so that's 998 and

642
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,440
a half okay now you can we can kill the

643
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,670
a little wonderful thing if you'll just

644
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,020
click the picture again so it there's

645
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,090
something up you can kill the slides if

646
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:32,150
you want until I start taking things

647
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:34,490
apart again all right by the end of this

648
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,930
and just he knows of the first time I've

649
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,220
ever presented that's why this is pretty

650
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:42,230
bad anyway so right here you're going to

651
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,990
mark that all the way down through back

652
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,190
to zero and so what you're going to

653
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,980
start seeing is you're going to start

654
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:51,170
seeing spikes and dips within your graph

655
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,990
and that's what starts to indicate

656
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,940
numbers for you spikes and dips so as

657
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,070
you start seeing that the right contact

658
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,950
point gets closer to the center of your

659
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:04,510
range this would be a dip on the right

660
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:07,520
contact points oh I want this picture

661
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:10,160
there we go even though I should

662
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,680
probably drop okay so as the numbers

663
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,810
start to head down on the on the right

664
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,760
contacts and they start to head up on

665
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,070
the left contacts you know that you're

666
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,530
actually getting narrower and narrower

667
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:24,320
so when you have a valley on your right

668
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,180
and a peak on your left that are near

669
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,500
each other that is a great indicator

670
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,820
that you have found a gate in that

671
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,080
position

672
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,168
now the next part that's really hard is

673
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,629
to understand where on the wheel that's

674
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:38,549
going to be and so that's when we do

675
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:39,509
something called a high-low test I'm

676
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,679
just gonna walk you through it really

677
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:44,850
quick because some of you look kind of

678
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:47,340
bored so a high-low test I usually start

679
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,080
with a low test and what you're going to

680
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,100
do is you're going to say yeah I think

681
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,619
this is where the gate is

682
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,389
and you're gonna you have the measure of

683
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,279
the contact point its width and those

684
00:30:54,389 --> 00:31:00,360
types of things so you're going to end

685
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,679
up spinning your wheels and so you're

686
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,110
going to spin them in a very specific

687
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,460
way so the very force print and I wrote

688
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,299
this down to make sure that I didn't say

689
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:12,240
it wrong and if you want to write this

690
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,740
down it probably helpful so the very

691
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,440
first thing we're going to do is make

692
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:24,179
sure that the last wheel ends up being

693
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:27,869
ten ten numbers I guess 10 degrees 10

694
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,610
steps I like to go like five really

695
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:31,889
because it's closer to ten fourths or

696
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,959
not even that but anyway so you're going

697
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:36,418
to go you're going to try to go higher

698
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,409
than the number that you think it is you

699
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,690
go higher than the number you think it

700
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,470
is so you're going to turn four times

701
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,999
because it's not like you're a high

702
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,159
school combination lock that will pick

703
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:46,379
up all four one time too except the

704
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,610
first one second and the third because

705
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:50,570
of the can so it's like there's four

706
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:54,658
wheels anyway so you're going to spin it

707
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,820
four times and you're going to go under

708
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:59,519
the number by ten that you want to test

709
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,860
that you think is the gate number to go

710
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,169
under by ten then you're going to spin

711
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,869
it three times and stop on the number

712
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:13,289
that you think it is and I'll actually

713
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:17,658
show you why no okay

714
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:19,590
anyway man I feel like a noob right now

715
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:21,029
does anybody want to tell me that I'm

716
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:25,769
doing like a slightly good job so I

717
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:28,590
don't get really nervous I like him he's

718
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:33,539
very helpful thank you

719
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,590
okay so basically I know I just didn't

720
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:37,379
wanna make you guys feel like you were

721
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,820
going through space for a second because

722
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:45,110
that actually makes me really sick when

723
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:47,450
people do that okay it's military-grade

724
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,908
it's fine

725
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,100
don't really is like it's like you know

726
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:56,419
Harrison Ford it can survive a nuclear

727
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,418
blast in them in a refrigerator

728
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,289
military-grade fridge oh that's a

729
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,499
picture too how do we get out of the

730
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,369
picture whoever said that really cool

731
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:08,220
click on the camera on the bottom Oh

732
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:13,220
such a somebody owns an Mac and uses it

733
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:16,590
for photos I use it for a terminal okay

734
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:20,129
so here and it's going to be slightly

735
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,240
difficult to see but the very first time

736
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:23,730
I'm turning all the way around

737
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,980
only the cam is moving so I said you

738
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,470
have to spin it four times right so only

739
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,559
the cams moving that was one rotation

740
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,419
now we have the first wheel moving I'm

741
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,700
gonna go 180 degrees I'm gonna pick up

742
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:38,730
the second wheel so it's the third time

743
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,179
I've gone so what happens is I'm going

744
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,710
to go to that number that's 10 under and

745
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:46,350
then I'm going to go back three which

746
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,559
will pick up the cam to the first wheel

747
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,740
to the second wheel and then I'm going

748
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,269
to stop there on the number that we

749
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,059
think the gate is so what that is done

750
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:58,850
is it set to to the number I think

751
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,690
there's a gate and one that there isn't

752
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:04,740
now I'm going to measure the contact

753
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:07,110
points and write that down I then go to

754
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,940
the next step and that's going to be

755
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,940
kind of left right left which is the

756
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,069
normal way we do it but then when I go

757
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,980
left I'm going to go to the correct

758
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:18,690
number right to the incorrect number and

759
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,319
then left to the correct number again

760
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:26,339
and so if this makes sense we're gonna

761
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:28,500
go left before leave the last wheel at

762
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,199
what we think the correct number is then

763
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,329
we're going to go to the wrong number

764
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,279
like turning to the right three then

765
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:37,409
we're going to go to the left twice as

766
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,419
this gets repetitive to the correct

767
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,339
number again and what we're doing is

768
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,480
we're isolating the wheels so the very

769
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:45,629
first way that we did it were

770
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,810
four times and in three we isolated the

771
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:50,668
third wheel to test the third wheel the

772
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,109
second time we did it when we went for

773
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:55,638
three two one

774
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:58,080
basically we isolated the second wheel

775
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,640
now the last one is just really easy

776
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,619
you're gonna pick them all up you're

777
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,440
going to set them to the correct number

778
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:11,190
and then you're going to just go around

779
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,400
once to the incorrect number and then

780
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:17,760
back to zero and that's isolating the

781
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,290
first wheel now the reason that we do

782
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,970
that is because as we check the the

783
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,740
depth on those contact points we're

784
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,660
going to see that one of them got really

785
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:33,470
big compared to the others and by really

786
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:36,540
big I mean like half of a number sorry I

787
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,720
exaggerate sometimes and what that shows

788
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,070
us is that for some reason that wheel

789
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,700
was the one that was controlling the

790
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,950
contact points so now we say great say

791
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,560
it was like thirty four was the was the

792
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,990
number that we were testing great now we

793
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,270
know that the third wheel the one that

794
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,970
was controlling that that gate has that

795
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:00,180
number in the combination that makes

796
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:02,129
sense yeah so this gets really tedious

797
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,899
over a really long period of time

798
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,369
because you always have to move by a

799
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,510
little bit and you have to check contact

800
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,770
points and you have to graph the whole

801
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,369
thing and so you're like yeah we have a

802
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,530
number yeah except for now you get to do

803
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,570
a whole nother graph you have to do

804
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,420
three graphs and you kind of do the same

805
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:21,570
thing except for what you can do is stop

806
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,590
worrying about one of the numbers so

807
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,460
what you're going to do is you're going

808
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,350
to set one wheel you're going to set

809
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,550
your known wheel if it was the second

810
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,960
wheel to the right number and you're

811
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,790
gonna set the next wheel and you're

812
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,190
going to test you're gonna graph that

813
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,480
all out all the way through just anybody

814
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,220
actually want me to go through how you

815
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,250
do that because it gets really long and

816
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,598
really boring if you don't want me to do

817
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,489
it raise your hand

818
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,170
Wow there's a lot of you people don't

819
00:36:45,489 --> 00:37:04,630
want me to do it alright pay attention

820
00:36:49,170 --> 00:37:06,459
all right cool ok so this takes a long

821
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,009
time and depending on how well they're

822
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:11,828
manufactured which I actually learned

823
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:13,869
today that big red does a lot of work

824
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:16,690
that's who made the the wheels I just

825
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:20,259
showed you that's why they're red so big

826
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:24,489
red they actually do wow I sound like

827
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:26,559
I've been smoking for twenty years they

828
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:28,589
actually do a really good job and trying

829
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,969
to keep their wheels precise which means

830
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,519
the closer they are in precision the

831
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:35,079
smaller you're going to see changes

832
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,718
within the contact points and within

833
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,309
depths and things of that nature so it

834
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,319
makes it harder and what it really does

835
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:44,170
is it makes it take a lot longer the

836
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:45,880
longer that a safe lock can withstand

837
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,170
somebody manipulating it the better

838
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,789
rating they get from underwriters

839
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,979
laboratory the more they can charge you

840
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:52,809
and the more people think they're

841
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:58,328
awesome I guess unless you're

842
00:37:52,809 --> 00:38:04,239
essentially safe thank you for laughing

843
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:05,650
that made me feel good yes yes by

844
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,029
centuries safes and give them as

845
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,619
presents to people that you know have

846
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:17,799
lots of money where you visit their

847
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:19,690
house often all right you're welcome

848
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,160
actually I should probably use that once

849
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:25,660
I open this one so it's easier to plant

850
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:30,009
things so they were like okay what can

851
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:31,328
we do more and honestly at this point

852
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,709
because people wanted to rush they

853
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:35,920
started doing a lot more destructive

854
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:37,569
attacks but destructive attacks are

855
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,099
really hard to demo make a lot of noise

856
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:40,630
and they're really expensive for me

857
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,739
because I'm gonna ruin a whole bunch of

858
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,269
bits and things to try to do it

859
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:46,319
so I like you guys but I don't love you

860
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:49,348
guys so we're gonna talk about

861
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,819
manipulation a little bit more so how

862
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,710
they decided to make it easier to

863
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:54,538
manipulate to get rid of clandestine

864
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,660
things is they came up with the group

865
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,509
one so the group one is a modification

866
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,999
not a complete overwrite of how the

867
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:04,680
mechanism works or the kind of went with

868
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,149
the group two they added the nose the

869
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,190
cam they change the way the fence works

870
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,349
those types of things what they did is

871
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:13,890
they decided to make these a lot harder

872
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:15,390
and the funny thing is the only reason

873
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,920
why this guy right here even came to

874
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,239
this presentation because I told him I

875
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,700
wouldn't take this apart for him down in

876
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:24,499
the Lok Lak community because he really

877
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,200
wanted to see the inside am i right yeah

878
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:31,640
totally right okay

879
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,308
so group ones group ones are crazy weird

880
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,420
they feel disgusting when you use them

881
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:41,359
they feel like they're broken and

882
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,359
they're not and we're gonna go over why

883
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:49,589
okay so this is the inside of a group

884
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:53,189
one and this is the backside of a group

885
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:55,650
one so this actually defeats quite a few

886
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,670
things and I'll tell you why these are

887
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:03,719
kind of set up the way that they are

888
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:04,920
right now one of the more common

889
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,430
destructive attacks that they would do

890
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,549
on group twos is they would just hold

891
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,890
the dial off rip the shaft out which

892
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:16,109
strips the cam and then they just shove

893
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,749
stuff in there and they try to blow the

894
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:22,410
back off of the lock they blow the back

895
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:26,038
off the lock the wheels fall out door

896
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,788
opens yeah it's like if you just drill a

897
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,479
lock on the door

898
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:31,829
blow it up so actually I'll show you

899
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:34,379
right now on this one too because I

900
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,930
forgot to talk about it the awesome

901
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,219
thing they came up with was this little

902
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,890
guy right here can you guys see that

903
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:44,009
little lever wonderful little lever what

904
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,319
it does is it spring-loaded so when the

905
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:49,229
lid is down it lifts up from that hole

906
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,119
inside of the bolt but if you ever blow

907
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:54,520
the back off it falls into how Owens out

908
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,369
of the bolt bolt doesn't move

909
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,980
everything fell apart now you can't open

910
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:02,680
it at all without drilling it or cutting

911
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,990
it open or so if you really don't like

912
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,710
people and you don't care to have what's

913
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,330
enzyme

914
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,859
just make them spend a couple thousand

915
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:16,150
dollars by blowing the back off of their

916
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:19,509
their safe lock I do not I do not

917
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,890
condone that action I'm just letting you

918
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:25,859
know that's a possibility in your life

919
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:29,319
okay so let's go back to this group one

920
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,810
so one of the worst things that I hate

921
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,130
about this group one I just I've never

922
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:36,609
been able to open this group one without

923
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:40,570
knowing the combination and it's this

924
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:45,790
how this cam works so this cam is a

925
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:46,869
two-part cam so it has a fence you can

926
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,759
see the fence geometry is different

927
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,920
which makes the contact points a lot

928
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,400
harder to read but as I turn this you're

929
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,760
gonna hear a wonderful noise you know

930
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,920
that there's two of them and the reason

931
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,130
it does that is because underneath that

932
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,910
cam is a spring-loaded ball bearing and

933
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:09,520
this cam is split into two parts this

934
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,250
golden part the brass part moves

935
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,470
continuously it just keeps moving no

936
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,450
matter what but the black part behind it

937
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,819
and I'll pull apart this cam in a second

938
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,189
after I show you the other stuff because

939
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,570
it's really messy the black part behind

940
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:29,500
it actually ends up being held in place

941
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:31,720
right there and so what it does is it

942
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,760
increases the friction like crazy on

943
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,379
this wheel making it harder to feel when

944
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,660
things happen and you have to overcome

945
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,400
that to get it to snap back and then it

946
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,859
snapped back and then it throws off

947
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,470
where you're at and it's just it's super

948
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:46,089
annoying to be a to be honest it makes

949
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,069
it hard to read contact points it makes

950
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:49,750
it hard to listen to it even though I've

951
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,099
never found listening to a lock like

952
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,940
they do in the movies to help me in any

953
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:56,890
way shape or form

954
00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:00,900
have you known anybody to do that yeah I

955
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,900
just I just feel the contact points

956
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,340
maybe if you have no sensitivity in your

957
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,840
fingers listening to it's a really good

958
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,970
I don't know it's never been like

959
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,920
beneficial to me but this makes it worse

960
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:17,379
so you would never want to do it anyway

961
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,330
the other thing that they do with these

962
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,840
group ones which is really fun with this

963
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:25,150
guy here the wheel pack is now separate

964
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,610
from that shaft and the way that it

965
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,380
makes contact and and creates the the

966
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,410
tension and everything is right here in

967
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,450
the center it's spring-loaded that

968
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,250
pushes against the cam it actually makes

969
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,470
it so that the tension as you spin is

970
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:42,340
variable even without the spring-loaded

971
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,839
can so now you're you're always varying

972
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,430
your tension is you spin it

973
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,590
it's flicking itself around and going

974
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:52,390
crazy and the wheel pack hates you so

975
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:56,440
that you pick them up the same but what

976
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:58,450
they also did is they run the wheels

977
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,730
backwards this is the one that touches

978
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,200
the cam and it goes backwards what you

979
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,080
can throw you off quite a bit actually

980
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,379
at least it does for me now I said that

981
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,440
this one's a group one r-right that's

982
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,390
because as things got crazy and they

983
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,460
started making these group ones that you

984
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,960
can't hear you can't feel you can't

985
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,820
really get much information out of with

986
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,740
a lot of time I think this one's over a

987
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,540
hundred and twenty straight man hours of

988
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,600
manipulation before it should be opened

989
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:28,000
is the UL the underwriters laboratory

990
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,380
rating for this lock which is why I'm

991
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,810
never gonna open it even though I keep

992
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,300
trying so they're like what can we do

993
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:36,940
how can we end up figuring it out

994
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,290
and it's not the most clandestine thing

995
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:42,430
in the world but they started taking

996
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,750
x-rays of the entire safe so they could

997
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,350
see where the gates were on the wheel

998
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,190
pack okay like no one's carrying around

999
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,569
a portable x-ray

1000
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:53,830
unless it's James Bond and it's probably

1001
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:56,080
in his watch so what they started doing

1002
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:59,319
is they started making Delrin or other

1003
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:02,799
type of plastic special wheels on the

1004
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,800
wheel pack and we're about to open this

1005
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,170
one up after I do my special magic trick

1006
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,170
where the wheel pack moves on its own

1007
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:18,460
okay so as you can see what this will

1008
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,710
they still have that same moving contact

1009
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,350
where they touch so that we get a lot

1010
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:25,210
more accuracy but you don't see any

1011
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:27,670
faults gates just like you didn't know

1012
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,860
on the big red because there's no point

1013
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,440
because the fence doesn't ride but what

1014
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:35,320
they have on this one is if you turn it

1015
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,680
around do you see all those wonderful

1016
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,920
little ridges they are the exact size as

1017
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,290
the same gate and they're more dense so

1018
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:49,390
what ends up when you x-ray this it just

1019
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:51,610
ends up looking like a big gear yes yeah

1020
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:55,480
that's pretty much it everywhere there

1021
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:58,090
is a gate everywhere and they have it on

1022
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,980
all of them and they are so sure about

1023
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:03,670
how wonderful that this works with that

1024
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,080
plastic is if you look really close is

1025
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,420
it a bit can you guys see what's on the

1026
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,170
front face of that you can see it

1027
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:14,110
ordered like passed around to show you

1028
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:17,260
there's numbers and there's a little

1029
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:18,910
niche right here right now right there

1030
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:25,410
on the wheel that points to the number

1031
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:28,990
that this wheel is this is 92 yeah look

1032
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:31,799
their number is 92 on this lock there's

1033
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:34,270
like we tell you it doesn't matter with

1034
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,280
with the other locks you have a special

1035
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,840
key to change the combination with this

1036
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,820
one you need a three-year-old and a

1037
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:44,140
screwdriver and you get the most random

1038
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:46,230
like combinations ever so that's what

1039
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,020
they started doing is they started

1040
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:53,620
making them more powerful above them in

1041
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:55,960
a way making them less complex because

1042
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,900
these are depressed and formed they're

1043
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,600
actually pretty much the same when it

1044
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,480
comes to how rounded they are the only

1045
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,520
problem that they present is that they

1046
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,820
have a lower number of combination opens

1047
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,560
a lot lower number because there's wear

1048
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,750
on the wheels because there's plastic

1049
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,299
and Casson zinc and things of that

1050
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,980
nature they will break more often where

1051
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,810
the other ones will not so you're kind

1052
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:24,050
of getting a trade-off

1053
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:25,180
but anyway let's go over this cam really

1054
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,230
quick so I think you guys will

1055
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,589
appreciate how it's made

1056
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:31,820
at least I always did and then we can

1057
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:38,410
talk about whatever you want to talk

1058
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:38,410
about actually because it's really fun

1059
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:45,710
so does anybody not ever cut their nails

1060
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:52,810
I'm just asking cuz I could use some

1061
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:52,810
help no I was like the Travis Center

1062
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,240
that might that might work I didn't

1063
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,210
think I would need a blade usually my my

1064
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,520
uh my flat head pulls it off but

1065
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,380
apparently when I was setting the lock

1066
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:11,870
yesterday I decided to really give it a

1067
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:16,900
smack awesome actually do you want to

1068
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:26,990
try to cut your finger and get enough I

1069
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:28,850
like this feels like it's gonna be a bad

1070
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,770
idea okay

1071
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,120
we won't show you how that goes in I

1072
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,890
will show you if you want to come up

1073
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,339
after and I have time time to pull it

1074
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:38,600
apart

1075
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:41,000
last but not least right here if you see

1076
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,880
that little golden button that's their

1077
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,590
blow-off lock right there that one

1078
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,720
actually puts so these group twos this

1079
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,860
one right here so I'll use the pull

1080
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,859
apart one because then it's easier to

1081
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,870
move the bolt this group two has that

1082
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,960
little tiny piece of brass that's kind

1083
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:02,509
of sitting inside of the hole so that's

1084
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,810
like what maybe an eighth of an inch

1085
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:08,450
thick

1086
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:10,820
oh well wide and less thick there

1087
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:13,490
actually are instances where you can get

1088
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,230
a tool that will go onto the back of

1089
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,700
that bolt and you can just start

1090
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,830
smacking it to try to share that tooth

1091
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:22,069
off and then you can just pull the bolt

1092
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:25,549
back by the low hole or by the fence or

1093
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:31,400
by whatever this one underneath that

1094
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:33,650
little button is a 3/8 inch rod that

1095
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,430
passes all the way through the bolt

1096
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:42,810
so it ain't moving so they get they get

1097
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:45,540
pretty crazy in the military so that's

1098
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,150
kind of the evolution of these locks now

1099
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:50,070
the last thing that they ever did in the

1100
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,510
evolution of manipulating locks to try

1101
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,520
to keep people from manipulating him

1102
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:55,230
when they got rid of the group one for

1103
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,660
the military they came up with another

1104
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,790
one that is technically a group one but

1105
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,259
I'd be like it's a group Omega because

1106
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,240
they I don't think you can do any better

1107
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,280
I don't have one it would cost me like a

1108
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,729
thousand dollars and like I said I like

1109
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,870
you but I don't love you guys um that's

1110
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,460
not true I probably love something you

1111
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:15,930
especially if my wife made it

1112
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:20,850
I think that's thank you yep miss her

1113
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:22,379
okay so what they did is that the slides

1114
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:25,680
don't matter right now if you want to

1115
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:29,940
switch it but what they did is they

1116
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,370
created a manipulated lock that was both

1117
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:36,510
electronic and manual you've probably

1118
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:38,609
seen one of these yes so basically what

1119
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,170
they are they're mini generators you

1120
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:43,410
start spinning it it creates enough

1121
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:46,170
power to kick itself on a little like

1122
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,450
LED screen turns on and starts showing

1123
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,760
you numbers as you turn it the numbers

1124
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,549
are not in consecutive order it just

1125
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,870
shows them to you randomly and so you

1126
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,930
spin until you see the number that you

1127
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:59,790
need then you spin it the other way see

1128
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,950
the number that you need and then back

1129
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:06,290
the other way and then it decides it's

1130
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:09,089
gonna open up for you which is wonderful

1131
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:12,509
the crazy thing is it has a logging

1132
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:14,010
system for audits so you can open it you

1133
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,300
can see how many times it opened you can

1134
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,010
see how many times somebody spun it

1135
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,990
without opening it you can see the last

1136
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,360
time somebody failed to open it this is

1137
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:23,850
all sorts of like random crazy things

1138
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,890
that you can do that one by under Aretas

1139
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:32,160
laboratory is rated at never being able

1140
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:33,600
to be manipulated open period no I

1141
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,799
haven't actually I haven't had a chance

1142
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,080
to look at it yet why did something

1143
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,530
really crazy happen somebody hack it

1144
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,350
somehow

1145
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:44,370
how'd they hack it do you want to come

1146
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:50,819
up here and tell her tell me oh that's

1147
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:52,950
really sad yes oh this is the point

1148
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,990
where I get like a thermal Lance and be

1149
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:58,200
like I hope that they made the steel out

1150
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:00,689
of less than what that x10 or I just get

1151
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,250
mad and probably hit the x10 with a bat

1152
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:04,250
so then they couldn't get any of their

1153
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,380
batter

1154
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:14,180
yeah I posed as the repair company that

1155
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,180
comes to fix it I know social engineers

1156
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:27,689
yeah honestly if you want to keep your

1157
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,750
sentry safe because you didn't because

1158
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:34,050
you should manipulate it open but if you

1159
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,900
don't I have opened them with like well

1160
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:40,080
I've cut through this deal with like

1161
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:42,480
screwdrivers in a hammer yeah an angle

1162
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:47,130
grinder will cut and cut it right open

1163
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,230
in like three minutes so so yeah but

1164
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,770
these other ones they actually use quite

1165
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:55,080
quite huge thick steel like a bank vault

1166
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:57,390
is inches of steel and they'll do things

1167
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,220
like put glass panes that are attached

1168
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,740
to your bolts and if you're trying to be

1169
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,200
mean to it the glass will break the

1170
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,870
bolts will kick out it's permanently

1171
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:11,189
locked until someone comes with

1172
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:14,040
something to blow it open okay so how

1173
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,510
many of you guys have been to Europe how

1174
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:24,600
many guys feel like Europe is a way

1175
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:26,700
weirder than America I do so I brought

1176
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,150
this just in case I have no clue what

1177
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,250
time it is

1178
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,040
oh seven minutes I almost made it an

1179
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:37,350
hour before I had to pull this out this

1180
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:39,840
is the combination for magic

1181
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,900
this is the combination for a European

1182
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,460
safe

1183
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,869
right there yeah I really feel like when

1184
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,700
I do if you're a-peein safes that we're

1185
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:54,480
like in the Dark Ages but it feels kind

1186
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:56,470
of cool like I'm opening a castle yeah

1187
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,240
I'm gonna show you the inside of this

1188
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,709
just for the fun of it because I told a

1189
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:06,459
few people that I'd do it if I had time

1190
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:08,650
and because I think it's cool this is

1191
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,660
what the inside of a European safe lock

1192
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:17,349
looks like this one came from Germany

1193
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:18,220
which means it's made really well okay

1194
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:25,960
so how this works

1195
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:29,919
he goes in he starts to turn all of them

1196
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,319
line up and the fence goes down this

1197
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,690
thing's way easier to open and takes way

1198
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,519
less time than a group to lock just to

1199
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,779
let you know if you want to come down to

1200
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:40,029
the lock-picking village since I've

1201
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:41,380
opened this and showing it to people and

1202
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:42,579
now if you guys ruin it I won't be that

1203
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,279
mad

1204
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,779
you can try to pick it it is not the

1205
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:48,960
easiest thing to pick but it's like

1206
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:51,700
picking a safety deposit box which

1207
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,670
aren't the easiest but they're fun so

1208
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:59,109
anyway I hope you can kind of see this

1209
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,700
the presentation was supposed to be both

1210
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:04,589
slightly informative on how to open a

1211
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:07,058
lock but more informative on how the the

1212
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:09,700
ideology of security and how it how it

1213
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:11,799
evolves evolved not just digitally but

1214
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,439
also mechanically and there's just kind

1215
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:18,309
of that pattern back and forth of find a

1216
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,989
vulnerability find a creative way to

1217
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:23,559
protect that vulnerability and not just

1218
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:26,380
obscure it my favorite one out of safe

1219
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:28,329
locks that they made the changes to that

1220
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,640
I really like is actually that cam that

1221
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:32,470
I hate I never would have thought about

1222
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,930
splitting a cam and a half and having it

1223
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:37,868
spring load and split itself as you turn

1224
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,519
and then having it smack around and so

1225
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,589
when I got that that lock I was actually

1226
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,819
quite quite excited if you guys want to

1227
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:45,009
come and play with the locks after

1228
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:46,390
they're going to be available to spin

1229
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:49,720
around down in lock-picking village as

1230
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,400
well yeah pretty much

1231
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,709
that's it if you guys have any random

1232
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,430
questions about anything even if it's

1233
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,300
about other locks

1234
00:55:54,430 --> 00:56:06,430
and probably answer them but anybody or

1235
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:09,190
yeah actually yeah I was probably like

1236
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:11,200
five and I saw that stuff in cartoons

1237
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,869
and I've always loved spy movies and

1238
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,540
when I got old enough that I could

1239
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:19,420
afford to buy things on my own I started

1240
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:21,520
doing stuff like that eventually I had a

1241
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,500
friend that came over to my house and I

1242
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,759
didn't know what he did for work and we

1243
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,839
were talking about that and he's like

1244
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,030
what do you do I told him I was a

1245
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,349
computer programmer and he's like I'm a

1246
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:33,579
locksmith and I was like you're like my

1247
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:35,020
hero like seriously can you teach me and

1248
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:36,400
he went out to his van made a few

1249
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,259
practice locks for me gave me a set of

1250
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,160
lock picks and started teaching me and

1251
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:44,680
then the safecracking thing something I

1252
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,240
always wanted to do I was cruising ksl

1253
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,250
for something some furniture or

1254
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,618
something for my wife and I saw sentry

1255
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:52,150
safe for 20 bucks and they're like we

1256
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:55,900
don't have a combination I was like this

1257
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:58,869
is the chance and I so I called my wife

1258
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,780
I was like hey can I have $20 and get

1259
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:03,630
you to go down to like woods cross why

1260
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,190
they're selling his safe and I want it

1261
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:08,319
so she did and I spent like three days

1262
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,430
ignoring my children trying to figure

1263
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,710
out how to do it on my own because I

1264
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,899
couldn't find any literature so that's

1265
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,760
that's how it started and now it keeps

1266
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,130
getting worse because I start buying

1267
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,930
more and more expensive locks and I have

1268
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:21,690
to feel guilty when eBay packages show

1269
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:30,819
up because I didn't talk to my wife

1270
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:33,730
any other questions yeah that depends on

1271
00:57:30,819 --> 00:57:35,140
the safe if it's a gun safe I don't care

1272
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,730
how heavy it is if it can be bolted to

1273
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,609
something bolted to something because

1274
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:42,369
that's irresponsible if you don't if

1275
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:46,359
it's a century safe just throw it in the

1276
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:48,869
garbage can and go buy another safe but

1277
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:51,730
no no there's definitely portable ones

1278
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:53,079
quick tip Oh actually it's over down at

1279
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:55,030
the Los Santos challenge they have that

1280
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,609
safe and you get points for getting the

1281
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,690
stuff out of it that it's just getting

1282
00:57:57,609 --> 00:57:59,980
this stuff I just picked up the whole

1283
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,980
safe and walked out with it and he gave

1284
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:04,839
me the points so no you do not have to

1285
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,200
fold it down but you should

1286
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:11,650
but yeah the heavier safe they're like

1287
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,419
thousands of pounds and so so no but if

1288
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:16,089
it's portable that usually means the

1289
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:20,440
manufacturer also recommends that you

1290
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:21,339
bolt it yeah but if if you lose the

1291
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,230
combination you're gonna have to go

1292
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:25,210
through the front of it or if you cement

1293
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,140
it in like a floor safe you're gonna

1294
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,599
have to go through the front of it or

1295
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:37,359
break up the cement any other questions

1296
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:41,349
yeah um it depends if I meet him

1297
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:46,440
difficult a group two can take me like

1298
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:51,220
40 hours I'll show you something

1299
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,839
group 2 this guy right here or actually

1300
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,609
I don't care if there's people watching

1301
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:57,040
whatever this thing right here okay so

1302
00:58:54,609 --> 00:59:00,400
this is a sergeant in Greenleaf 8088

1303
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,500
padlock it works like a group too the

1304
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,510
only difference is that it doesn't have

1305
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,700
you actually get to control the fence on

1306
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:10,210
this one and you control it by pulling

1307
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:12,609
up on the shackle itself so it is a

1308
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,560
combination of a group too because it

1309
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:17,589
works with a cam and you have to graph

1310
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,119
it and that sentry safe where you can

1311
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:21,099
kind of control it at the same time and

1312
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,339
kind of get a feel for some things so

1313
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:27,430
yeah if you want to practice kind of

1314
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:28,810
like medium of the mediums or actually

1315
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,890
easy of the mediums one of these is a

1316
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,089
great way to get started

1317
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:33,098
plus you can carry it around with you

1318
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:35,740
everywhere and like you could probably

1319
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:37,930
keep track of your graphs and stuff on a

1320
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,879
digital device I just like to use paper

1321
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:43,839
because when you use paper I can tape it

1322
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:46,450
to the safe and leave it there then come

1323
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,890
back where like if I'm using my iPad pro

1324
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:52,480
I have to go find my iPad pro if it dies

1325
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:54,759
I can't work on the safe so yeah I can

1326
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,099
take a like it really depends on the UL

1327
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,900
rating but I'm not that great so like a

1328
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:02,579
20-hour will probably take me 48 hours

1329
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:05,579
because I'm not perfect anything else

1330
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,579
yeah

1331
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,080
all the time

1332
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:26,690
that is actually one of the difficult

1333
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,130
things it depends on how much

1334
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,470
information there is you can actually

1335
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:33,440
look at dials sometime and kind of

1336
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:36,230
figure out the maker like this Mossler

1337
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,330
right here that dial configuration what

1338
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:40,310
it looks like is unique to them and it's

1339
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:42,380
within a certain time period so you can

1340
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:44,660
say okay it's this on Mossler let's see

1341
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,910
if we can find a safe that's like this

1342
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,950
or a floor safe from Mossler in that

1343
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:51,350
time period another great way that

1344
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,210
people don't use a lot of the time is if

1345
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:55,310
you can find any other information

1346
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:58,730
written on the safe you can try to look

1347
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,840
at patents yeah a lot of people won't do

1348
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,160
a patent search but you can look at

1349
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,780
patents and they usually detail how the

1350
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,950
lock works as well so if there's

1351
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,530
anything hidden in there that will screw

1352
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:08,629
you up you can usually see it so that's

1353
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,430
usually where I go so a lot of googling

1354
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,590
I'm you're gonna end up reading a lot of

1355
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:15,470
really old scanned PDFs usually

1356
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:18,530
sometimes I'll even end up reading old

1357
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:20,720
like Sears catalogs like digitized ones

1358
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:27,100
to get any more information that I can

1359
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,100
about the safe yeah pretty much yeah

1360
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:40,980
he has okay so I wouldn't I don't like

1361
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:43,290
doing videos because videos get really

1362
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,550
like they will outpace you and it can be

1363
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:49,140
really frustrating going back and back

1364
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:50,550
and back but I could actually probably

1365
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:54,509
send this to you if you if you're really

1366
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:56,340
interested there is a guy that is a

1367
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,430
pretty great safecracker that came up

1368
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,480
with safecracking for everyone and I

1369
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:02,270
didn't even know about it for the

1370
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,350
longest time because after I had uh

1371
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,420
after I had got the first one which I

1372
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:08,940
just tried to figure out on my own and

1373
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,590
after I'd gotten that one I went and

1374
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,720
bought like two and took it apart and

1375
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:16,260
tried to figure out how you would start

1376
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,029
to figure it out and so then I just kind

1377
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,160
of went with that and then I saw

1378
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,480
somebody talk about graphing once on a

1379
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,490
YouTube video and I didn't quite

1380
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,720
understand it so I just kind of tried to

1381
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:28,410
figure that on my own and started to

1382
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,899
make sense but this one that PDF he

1383
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:33,990
sells the book as an e-book but he's

1384
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,040
also been known to say just find the PDF

1385
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,169
somewhere on the Internet

1386
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,440
he doesn't care but it's called

1387
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,270
safecracking for everyone and I've

1388
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,090
looked through that one recently before

1389
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:47,100
doing this to make sure that I was kind

1390
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,050
of on the up-and-up I didn't know about

1391
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,029
high testing before I'd read it

1392
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:52,020
I always just did low testing because I

1393
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,300
didn't think high testing would matter

1394
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,920
but it can actually help verify things a

1395
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,500
little bit more and he takes you

1396
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,570
step-by-step through how he does it and

1397
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,640
we'll tell you about like all will

1398
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:05,880
graphs and those types of things so you

1399
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,009
can go over it and like walk through it

1400
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,960
slowly at your own pace which I prefer

1401
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:11,790
you can just keep referencing it or

1402
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,640
print it out and look at it over and

1403
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,259
over again while you do the step so yeah

1404
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,910
I definitely encourage you guys to look

1405
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:22,160
at that one that's all about like group

1406
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,160
twos anyone else

1407
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:35,279
okay so I get all of my locks off of

1408
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:36,690
ebay usually it's because somebody so

1409
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,720
there's this really big trend to move

1410
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,390
into the electronic lock space for like

1411
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,529
gun safes and things I don't like it

1412
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:45,029
electronic locks have a lot more that

1413
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,640
can go wrong with them over time then

1414
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,860
mechanical ones can and I like the idea

1415
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,549
that if I couldn't find batteries or ran

1416
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,050
out of power

1417
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:54,570
I don't like that I couldn't open my

1418
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:56,520
safe but a lot of people are modifying

1419
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:59,160
their safes and getting them replaced so

1420
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:03,660
a lot of those locks are on eBay so you

1421
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:05,549
can get them really really cheap yeah

1422
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,870
they just take the whole thing off so

1423
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,580
this just comes off the door on both

1424
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,990
sides and then they put the new ones on

1425
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:15,690
both sides and hook it up and it's done

1426
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:17,459
so that's where I get my locks group

1427
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:19,680
ones are a little bit harder to find but

1428
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:22,650
they're actually usually really cheap

1429
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,359
because nobody really wants to use them

1430
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,720
on anything like I think this one was 25

1431
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,600
bucks but they used to like guard

1432
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,160
top-secret documents now it gets torn

1433
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:36,330
apart in front of strangers

1434
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,839
so that and then these ones they were

1435
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:41,400
just locked mounts that were made by or

1436
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,080
just a lock a locksmith company

1437
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:48,060
it's like M&B locks or something like

1438
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:50,340
that but now Marv Marv the great he

1439
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,680
actually put together an STL for 3d

1440
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:56,160
printing these so I would actually go

1441
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,990
towards talking to him because these

1442
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,790
cost like twelve bucks and I think I'm

1443
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,620
Thingiverse you didn't get a whole bunch

1444
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:04,680
of these printed and shipped to your

1445
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:07,500
house for less than that per four piece

1446
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,180
so that's where I ended up getting those

1447
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,260
the ones that we have done in

1448
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,029
lock-picking village the ones that are
