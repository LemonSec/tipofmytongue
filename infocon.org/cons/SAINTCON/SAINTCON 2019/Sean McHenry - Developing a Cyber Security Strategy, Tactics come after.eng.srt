1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
during the servers were not setting up

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,720
new users so we're pulling people away

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,030
from their jobs to ensure that our

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
initiatives are being done so we need to

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,700
make sure that we're sensitive to their

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,740
time so prioritize available resources

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,920
you know what what is it that that we

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:28,320
have access to you know we we may not

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:32,090
have the the superstar in our team okay

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,130
we may just have a bunch of pop Warner's

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,200
okay it's great opportunity because we

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,360
can help mentor them and bring them up

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,670
but you know what resources do we have

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:48,120
available to us again your controls need

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,219
to be well defined and I would highly

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,430
highly highly highly highly recommend

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,750
that everything that you do when at all

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,090
possible can tie back to your standards

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,079
okay I don't think you'd necessarily

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,350
going to get a hundred percent of that

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,600
but just baked into your program

22
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,548
standards and everything should be able

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,850
to meet that because thing is standards

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,960
they're defensible right if somebody

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,470
said well I don't think that that's

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,830
right

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,080
well here's the standard if you don't

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,759
agree with that let's go talk to the

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,189
people who wrote the standards and we'll

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,290
try and get it changed okay but at least

31
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,570
you have some foundation that you can

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:35,970
stand on okay and establish metrics the

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:39,020
value of metrics is beyond being able to

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,619
say gee where should I be able to put

35
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,020
you know the the admin resources for

36
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,390
fixing vulnerabilities the value of

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,449
metrics is is you can actually take

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,630
those metrics to your executive level

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,149
and be able to say we have been tracking

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,969
this we have been evaluating this this

41
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,840
is where we stand and if your tools and

42
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,820
your metrics again are rooted in

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,740
industry standards you're going to have

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,690
a much better conversation with your

45
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,690
executive level okay

46
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,209
so visibility they help give us

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,790
visibility into where things really are

48
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,950
identify those risks if you have

49
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,769
compliance needs and you're having to

50
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,140
report whether it's to government agency

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,510
or PCI for that matter you're having to

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,768
do these reports these metrics will help

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:41,019
you in those compliance and again your

54
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:42,790
metrics need to be clearly defined okay

55
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,519
we talked about offense let's talk a

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,010
little bit about defense okay our

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,060
tactics what we're going to do

58
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,489
play-by-play is going to help us achieve

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,739
our end vision or end goal what do we

60
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,970
want the what we want the end to look

61
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:04,989
like okay so in this particular

62
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:11,019
structure in defense if you can look we

63
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:14,200
have a show here no these three here

64
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,810
that's our defensive line the only three

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,310
of them so then you've got behind them

66
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,470
you've got your linebackers you have

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,329
your quarterbacks on the end this

68
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,650
particular defensive formation this

69
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,780
defensive play what do you think of

70
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,299
we're trying to defend against pass a

71
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,379
pass play ok defensive line they're not

72
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,449
gonna be running all over the place

73
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,828
they're not big they're too big they're

74
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:39,280
they're not fast enough

75
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,870
ok whereas this particular structure

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,569
look at that defensive line what are we

77
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:49,900
trying to defend against runners yeah

78
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:51,548
a running play ok we still do have a

79
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,609
couple of linebackers back there we have

80
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,620
that free safety we do still have our

81
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,560
corner backs out on the end so just in

82
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,680
case we didn't read the play right we do

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,879
have some element of defense right what

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:12,030
do we call this in cyber security

85
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:15,310
defense in depth right ok I don't know

86
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,709
no I'm kidding Pop Warner gotta love

87
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,750
them right just all those little kids

88
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,900
running around

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,120
this is uh this is called a43 where you

90
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,000
have four people on the defensive line

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,120
you've got three of your linebackers

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,090
right behind them this is widely

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,319
considered to be the best balance and

94
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:44,840
defense that you know if if it's if you

95
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,910
have a good team okay a lot of times you

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,008
know in like high school and sometimes

97
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,560
in college depending depending on the

98
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:55,250
the college this you don't see this very

99
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,470
often because that defensive line just

100
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,820
doesn't have the the size and strength

101
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,380
and the speed to be able to do much but

102
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,479
when you get into professional football

103
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,539
then you know you see this you know

104
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,758
structure a little bit more but but

105
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:11,419
having four on the defensive line if

106
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,419
you've got a good defensive line you can

107
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,210
have other players to be able to protect

108
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,520
so you have a good protection for run

109
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,340
you have a good protection for passing

110
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,380
you don't have the best for either one

111
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,090
of those but you're you've got a really

112
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:33,940
good broad defense okay so when we take

113
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:37,039
a look at tactics in cyber security

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,340
you know just in football you have to

115
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,000
have a multitude of plays you cannot

116
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,310
just do that run the same play again and

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,240
again and again the other side of the

118
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,340
team is going to notice that and they're

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,250
going to change the way they do things

120
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,258
okay

121
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:02,090
how many would agree that we've come a

122
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:03,289
long way in boundary protections you

123
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,719
know we do a pretty good job in

124
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,759
boundaries and and the firewall

125
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,560
technology is there to really kind of

126
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,270
help protect of course you got to

127
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,509
configure the firewall properly of

128
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:18,859
course but that's that's kind of a known

129
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:21,139
thing now and so it's we don't have well

130
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,199
the it still happens the attackers are

131
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,740
still looking for holes in that boundary

132
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,409
device that's not the biggest focus on

133
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,139
their attack vector right where is the

134
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:38,599
biggest focus now what

135
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:40,969
think fishy phishing represents more

136
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,870
than 90% of the attacks or is at least

137
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:47,900
evolved at some point okay they just

138
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,729
went around the firewall okay and so if

139
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,438
you're constantly putting all of your

140
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,599
emphasis on making sure that that

141
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,029
firewalls in place and then you have I

142
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,688
don't know an executive who gets fished

143
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,490
or wailed all that effort is for naught

144
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:05,300
okay so you have to have a good

145
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:08,860
portfolio of place you need to be able

146
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,819
to pivot in the middle of a play okay so

147
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,750
of course everybody knows about

148
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:19,460
ransomware but there's there's been a

149
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:23,150
slight shift in the way attackers are

150
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,669
approaching ransomware and the the the

151
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,849
big approach for a long time was fishing

152
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,849
because it is such a successful means to

153
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,039
be able to get inside of an organization

154
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,839
but that is quickly waning people are

155
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,878
aware and and there being a lot more

156
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,039
cautious about what they're clicking on

157
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:44,870
we haven't won that battle yet but we're

158
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,909
getting there and so but this this this

159
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,979
kind of shotgun throw the spaghetti

160
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:52,490
against the wall and see what sticks is

161
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:58,430
great for the for the you know $300

162
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:00,740
you know ransom etc but the shift the

163
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,560
slight shift in in ransomware is that

164
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,469
you have your advanced persistent threat

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,899
your attacker gets inside maybe they got

166
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,930
inside through a fish but that's not

167
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:14,779
what engaged the ransom that they get in

168
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,189
and they start moving within your

169
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,560
environment and they start collecting

170
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,379
information about how things are set up

171
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,379
and they try and get various credentials

172
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,300
if they're able to and and they could be

173
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,089
in your environment for a month or six

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:35,390
months or a year getting intelligence

175
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:37,190
and then they hit you with a ransom now

176
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,380
they know who you are they know what

177
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,709
kind of data you have and they know how

178
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,480
valuable it is and so instead of trying

179
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:49,180
to shotgun approach you know

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,370
rent some things off give us $1,000 in

181
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,910
Bitcoin and we'll give you the key they

182
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:59,740
now know who you are maybe the value is

183
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,939
a million dollars in Bitcoin okay so so

184
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,880
you have to be able to learn how to

185
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,270
pivot you know that the attack is there

186
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,920
but it's it's a running play is is he

187
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,020
going to run to the left or run to the

188
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,069
right I don't know we got to wait till

189
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,640
it comes and you have to be able to

190
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:19,420
pivot okay and we have to be able to

191
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,520
pick our plays based on the risk okay

192
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,079
you got to do those security assessments

193
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,120
you got to do those risk assessments and

194
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,850
then you have to be able to pick how are

195
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,970
we going to accomplish this goal based

196
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,870
on where we are in our risk tolerance

197
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,910
our risk appetite and just the risk

198
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,040
landscape that's out there and so it's

199
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,339
really important when you make all of

200
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,550
these decisions you make the decision

201
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:51,760
based on risk not just cybersecurity

202
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:54,300
risk but risk to the organization okay

203
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,800
so we have our lifecycle and

204
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,439
cybersecurity risk is only just a

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,430
portion of the overall corporate risk or

206
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,640
organization or agency risk okay we you

207
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,430
need to do that initial assessment you

208
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,449
know where do the security assessment

209
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,239
security assessment feeds your risk

210
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,260
assessment do that risk assessment when

211
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,270
you have a good idea of where you are

212
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:25,060
then you can inform the corporate risk

213
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:27,610
assessment you can see there at the

214
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,189
bottom the corporate risk acceptance

215
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,500
okay that's your executives they're

216
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,960
going to have to make some level of

217
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,030
determination as to where are we going

218
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,110
to put resources because as we know

219
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,280
nobody has everything and so sometimes

220
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,630
you're gonna win sometimes you're not

221
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,990
going to win the the resource battle

222
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,780
okay but depending on what that is what

223
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,450
the outcome is you have to develop some

224
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,670
kind of strategy based on your

225
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,529
conditions and upon your players skill

226
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,990
set and

227
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,089
upon what what the threat landscape

228
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,589
looks like in the pond you know what

229
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,389
kind of vulnerabilities and everything

230
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,930
that you have you have to develop some

231
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,819
kind of strategy and then you implement

232
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,859
that strategy you put your tactics to

233
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:16,719
work hopefully you can have a really

234
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,420
good plan you've got a really good team

235
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,139
and you can get really good plays in

236
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:27,699
order to be successful and sometimes

237
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:33,399
unfortunately sometimes we get put in

238
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:36,040
the back seat okay but let's just make

239
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,379
the best of what we've been given okay

240
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,879
so we may be in the backseat but we can

241
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:46,629
at least have our coloring book with us

242
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:48,579
right okay all right so every time I

243
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,300
come here I always talk about the

244
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:54,339
shoestring budget part okay because

245
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,199
everybody is constrained with money okay

246
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,680
so this is great

247
00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:02,109
yay strategy yay tactics what am I going

248
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:10,000
to do how am I going to do this okay I

249
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:13,230
have been a big supporter with NIST okay

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,920
the reason why I support NIST so much is

251
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:22,660
because it is at no additional cost I

252
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,120
don't say free because maybe nobody else

253
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,879
in here but every April April

254
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,240
Uncle Sam comes and talks to me to pay

255
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,680
for things like this okay but it's at no

256
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,839
additional cost you can go to the NIST

257
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,529
website and everything is there and you

258
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,439
can download everything you've got free

259
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:45,209
no additional cost access okay you got

260
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:50,550
to pay for your internet right okay I

261
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:53,138
would suggest as a framework again

262
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,219
because there's no additional cost to it

263
00:12:53,139 --> 00:13:00,639
is the NIST cybersecurity framework it

264
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:04,269
it was implemented a few years ago it

265
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,899
just went through an iteration and and

266
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:10,689
so it's on version 1.1 now but if you go

267
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,970
to I think I've put it here yeah if you

268
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,680
go to that website that

269
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,110
lands you on the main page of the NIST

270
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,378
cybersecurity framework and everything

271
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,110
that they have to be able to support the

272
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:25,329
identify protect detect respond and

273
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,980
recover that framework everything is

274
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:30,399
there

275
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:34,600
ok one of the reasons why a lot of the

276
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,139
reasons but why NIST why do I evangelize

277
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,959
NIST

278
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:40,689
again no additional charge but it is

279
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:45,339
backed by a library a very extensive

280
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:47,529
library of how to's ok it's it's great

281
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,600
to know what you need to do but if you

282
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:53,110
don't really know how you need to do it

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,879
it becomes cumbersome ok and if you

284
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,019
remember a few slides back what did I

285
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:01,589
say based on standards ok

286
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,759
I like standards because you have

287
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:06,370
thousands of the best minds that have

288
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,149
come together to say this is the best

289
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:12,009
that we can put out there my mom kept

290
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:15,370
telling me growing up that I don't know

291
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,199
everything and and while I fought her as

292
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,550
a child I've come to realize how wise

293
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:24,040
she is I don't but with thousands of the

294
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,870
best minds together maybe we can come up

295
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,370
with something better right and so we

296
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,009
have the standards and of course

297
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,350
everybody here is welcome and this is

298
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,819
always looking for feedback and as they

299
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,040
go through their iterations of their

300
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:43,360
documents and be a part of the community

301
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:46,180
ok support it if I put this up here if

302
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,360
you work with the government ok this is

303
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,239
their language if you if you work with

304
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,480
the federal government you have to speak

305
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,689
to this most state agencies speak NIST

306
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,529
and so rather than trying to be

307
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,879
multilingual in cybersecurity if you

308
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,009
work with the government maybe you just

309
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,089
want to pick NIST because you only have

310
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,089
one language to speak

311
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,980
one of the things too that this does is

312
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,240
it correlates security with privacy

313
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,890
security and privacy are two very

314
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:28,450
distinct disciplines people conflate

315
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:31,920
them quite frequently we have at USB II

316
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,890
a pretty spectacular privacy team and

317
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,319
very passionate about what they do and

318
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,930
they deal with the who gets to see what

319
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,110
information under what conditions based

320
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,790
on the laws that govern what we do my

321
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,920
job is you know okay great now that

322
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,329
we've had that define how do we protect

323
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,930
it and make sure that those things are

324
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,200
in place

325
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:58,989
that's pretty simplified of what that is

326
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:01,540
but NIST even in you know so if we talk

327
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:07,150
NIST 853 which is about the security

328
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:10,719
controls we're currently on Rev four Rev

329
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,340
five is in final draft they kind of

330
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
missed their deadlines so they haven't

331
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,630
read to find their deadlines so but rep

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,690
five is coming out pretty soon but even

333
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:24,460
in Rev four they addressed privacy

334
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,790
specifically and appendix J of 853 Rev

335
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,310
four are all the privacy controls and

336
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,589
and even in ref four they talk about how

337
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,089
security and privacy play Rev five it's

338
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,520
a lot better and they have a better

339
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,080
understanding of you know which are

340
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,689
security controls which are privacy

341
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,100
controls but really a lot of them you

342
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,760
know really need to have a good

343
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,670
collaboration between the two okay and

344
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,710
so so NIST is really taking this this

345
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,530
concept of privacy in developing

346
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,270
resources behind it it's it's about time

347
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,060
I mean we've only had privacy laws for

348
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:08,200
how long since 1776

349
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:11,740
oh so the other thing about nest is you

350
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,480
know it was written to be able to take

351
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,700
you all the way through you know your

352
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,700
super secure Department of Defense type

353
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,689
organizations and and environments but

354
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,190
especially with the NIST cybersecurity

355
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,280
framework

356
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,370
they've been able to strip out a lot of

357
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,990
the the noise for those super secure

358
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,250
environments and be able to really focus

359
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:39,310
that I know that there's a law that has

360
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,940
asked NIST so Congress has asked NIST to

361
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:46,480
go into the cybersecurity framework and

362
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,540
actually kind of make it more simple for

363
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,580
your Main Street type mom-and-pop shops

364
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,500
to be able to consume so for their

365
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,020
cybersecurity initiative so so there's

366
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,970
really is a good effort for that we're

367
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,500
brand new really small not a lot of

368
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,230
resources all the way up to we're

369
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,400
working with a Department of Defense

370
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:11,950
okay this risk management project so

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:15,610
these are all of the the documents that

372
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,560
NIST has identified in their risk

373
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,800
management project which is FISMA

374
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,230
whether FISMA is the act that's the law

375
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,270
that created this whole thing with this

376
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,730
risk management but these are all of the

377
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,020
documents that they've created in order

378
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:36,250
to help generate a risk-based approach

379
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:40,889
to cybersecurity that's a lot people

380
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:46,420
look at me really weird I truly honest I

381
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:50,380
love NIST documents I read these like I

382
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,930
read anything else I am as happy reading

383
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,330
a good NIST technical document as

384
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,400
somebody would be reading science

385
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,220
fiction I I kid you not I love these

386
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,400
things if you're like me let's get

387
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,290
together we can have a book club and if

388
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,620
you're not that's okay

389
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,600
you know we forgive you but but if you

390
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:16,090
take a look at these this will step you

391
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,850
through how to develop a risk-based

392
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,990
approach to cybersecurity the importance

393
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:27,550
of this let's go back to our executives

394
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:31,300
executives speak risky's right most of

395
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:35,260
the time they think money money money

396
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,600
okay but ultimately they speak risk ease

397
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,640
if you can learn how to

398
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,070
speak that language you're going to have

399
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:49,870
a better time okay these are the

400
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:54,520
documents to help you do that this is

401
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:58,629
the Forbes this was again in in August

402
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,379
that this came out the percentage of

403
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,750
surveyed CIS o--'s who believe talent

404
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,390
constraints meaning they don't have

405
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,090
enough people to run their program

406
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:13,330
that's the talent constraint have an

407
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,639
extremely high impact on their security

408
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:19,590
organizations we don't have enough

409
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,590
people we need more people on the team

410
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:28,720
three times higher those that have a

411
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,730
strategy constraint meaning they do not

412
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,600
have a strategy that is explicitly

413
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,100
defined to a specific vision or goal

414
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,750
they don't have a strategy and so

415
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,059
therefore they are three times more

416
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:46,690
likely to say we don't have enough

417
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:49,000
people on the team okay so it's really

418
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,400
really important that you have that

419
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,820
strategy because then you know how to

420
00:20:51,400 --> 00:21:01,150
work the resources that you do have and

421
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:05,200
so with all this you know go forth and

422
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:07,150
conquer okay now Richard Moe Richard

423
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,059
Moe's an attorney out of Minnesota he

424
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,370
was actually the chief of staff for

425
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,690
vice-president Mondale

426
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,020
who you know was vice president when

427
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,450
Jimmy Carter was president okay but he

428
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,960
also went on and I've got his little

429
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,150
notes here he was the he was also the

430
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,240
president of the National Trust for

431
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,039
Historic Preservation so it was really

432
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,059
important for him this idea of

433
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,370
communities okay and and development and

434
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,678
preservation of communities okay so

435
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,629
communities can be shaped by choice or

436
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,630
by chance okay

437
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:47,320
I just want to say maybe we can shift

438
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,920
that a little bit security cyber

439
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,860
security can be shaped by choice or

440
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,760
shaped by chance we can keep on

441
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:01,030
accepting the same kind of security that

442
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,660
we get or we can start creating the kind

443
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,430
of security that we want I guess I

444
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,180
should have put a line through his name

445
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:12,430
it but my name in there right so so the

446
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,940
question though is you know what are you

447
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:18,130
going to do okay you have to be able to

448
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,370
speak with the executives you have to be

449
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:25,240
able to you know communicate with them

450
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,879
on their level okay it's not an easy

451
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,660
task I know remember how I was talking

452
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,410
with the the owner of the law firm that

453
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:38,170
guy I learned a lot from him and I'm so

454
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,370
grateful for the opportunity but I

455
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:44,890
affectionately say that he was so

456
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:48,159
miserly that he made Scrooge look like

457
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:51,660
he spent like a drunken sailor okay and

458
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:56,320
so to get him to open up to any

459
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:59,230
initiative that I had was was a battle

460
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,820
and so you have to learn how to speak

461
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,760
with the executives that you have and

462
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,370
you have to be able to help them to see

463
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,680
what that vision is and the best way

464
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,870
that you can do that is to be able to

465
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,810
walk in on an annual basis ma and you

466
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,570
know whatever that the timeframe is with

467
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,250
a report to say here this here's the

468
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,899
framework we're following here the

469
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,610
standards that help us put this together

470
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,980
here are the metrics that we've

471
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:28,330
collected we have done our assessment

472
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:30,040
this is the risk that we have what are

473
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,429
we going to do about this this is what I

474
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,920
would like it to look like can we can we

475
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,410
do this together

476
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,740
okay so you have to be able to have that

477
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,780
conversation and develop a good strategy

478
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:49,710
something that they are going to be able

479
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,710
to consume Thanks

480
00:23:49,830 --> 00:24:00,149
I have ten minutes you're absolutely

481
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,559
welcome to ask questions if you if

482
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,178
people wanted to leave it's the end of

483
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,730
the day that's fine thank you for

484
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:08,399
sticking around you can come up here we

485
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:12,389
can talk more you can leave me alone to

486
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:14,809
my own devices yes sir back up one slide

487
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,809
yes

488
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,120
