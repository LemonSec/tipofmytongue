1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,379
so the joke is why spider-man so good at

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,830
comebacks with great power comes great

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,830
responsibility

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:25,109
we're good all right so you guys are

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,189
lucky if you're here you get to see the

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,480
slides if you're watching on YouTube

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,430
sorry you don't get slides so let's get

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,420
started really quick a little bit of

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,880
background about me

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,820
this is who I am I'm zodiac if you've

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,870
seen me on slack or on comm somewhere I

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,219
put the pictures I'd rather be out

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,038
riding my bike and stand in front of you

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,879
guys but I sadly have to play the adult

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,770
game way too much in life by the way if

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,539
you came to my 9 a.m. presentation does

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,309
it's gonna sound very familiar I'm sorry

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,250
I am a broken record and that's all you

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,959
get the next bit is why I like to ride

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,470
my bike because I'm a sucker for hot

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,600
chocolate and donuts being in Provo I

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,270
feel morally compelled to point out that

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,770
true ice-cream is of the Aggie variety

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,520
and it has nothing to do with the BYU

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,890
Creamery if you could if you complain my

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,860
argument back is to look at the stats

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,470
you look at Dairy Sciences programs and

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,570
out of the Usui the Aggie ice cream

29
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,548
program has come a still far from FAR's

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,220
ice cream and the Snelgrove ice cream

31
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,100
shop as far as I'm aware BYU's number

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,810
sits as a big fat zero

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,360
they have zero successful ice cream

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,400
ventures out of their program so anyway

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,789
that's what I've got to back that stat

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
up next I'm a little i've trent i do a

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,530
little a lot of red teaming of my

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,259
responsibilities now so I do pin tests

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,840
and auditing and things been on the

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,590
saint con committee for I don't actually

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,450
know like six or seven or five or eight

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,110
years or something a long time earlier

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,320
this year

44
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,380
help help found the dc4 3:5 group get

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,508
that rolling we're going to talk about

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,879
local hacker and Def Con groups and

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,380
other things like that so if you don't

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,769
have one then start

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,260
it's not that hard put us you up there

50
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,620
cuz I do work up at Utah State my title

51
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,670
systems administrator I am a recovering

52
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,200
VMware and storage admin I now mostly do

53
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:33,149
information security do less and less

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:37,079
what's this admin side anyway that's me

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,910
mostly I am also not artistically

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,850
inclined you'll see my slides and

57
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,450
realize that my art ability is like this

58
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,950
is the prettiest slide I've got all day

59
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm also not a hot I am not by any means

60
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,049
the most skilled or accomplished or

61
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,040
practiced cetf person I'm just the

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,960
sucker that said I can present on that

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,579
so I this presentation I really want it

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,050
to be a discussion I wanted to be topics

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,810
there's a few things where I list out

66
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,190
tools and ideas and I know that I don't

67
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,360
know all of them I don't have all the

68
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,079
answers I don't have all the solutions

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,730
so please please PLEASE shout out raise

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,100
your hand whatever and say you didn't

71
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,010
put this up there because I wrote these

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,260
slides at like 3:30 this morning and I

73
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,019
am positive that I forgot a whole bunch

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,359
of stuff and I don't know a lot and what

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,750
little I do know I I forgot because I

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,370
was should have been sleeping I'm also

77
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,910
not the smartest person in the room and

78
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:42,150
I'm also not a really great presenter so

79
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:43,710
you take what you get so let's get going

80
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,660
and start talking a little bit about

81
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,910
what is a capture the flag

82
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,370
I googled this that picture in the

83
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,710
background apparently that is

84
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,080
legitimately a wikiHow article on how to

85
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,700
play capture the flag outside and you do

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,650
need to look like someone just kicked

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,709
you in the back or something I don't

88
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,590
know what's going on with those kids

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,270
but capture the flag is it's a pretty

90
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,630
generic and vanilla term that gets

91
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,290
applied to all kinds of things is you

92
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,180
know is it people think of the all

93
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,219
different kinds of things some kid

94
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,049
playing video games it's some it's you

95
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,989
know it's Matthew Broderick and war

96
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,659
games and war dialing and everything

97
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,948
no it's all this defense it's planning

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,750
the defense and getting everything going

99
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:33,520
for that no it's I remember his name in

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,419
the Italian Job Seth Green his character

101
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,190
but there's a whole bunch of things but

102
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:42,080
pretty much captured the flag is a term

103
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,330
that's used to apply to a whole bunch of

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,000
different type of information security

105
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:51,229
related competitions and events there

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,729
are hope these are some of the different

107
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:55,430
examples and types of capture the flag

108
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:57,710
events that people have jeopardy is kind

109
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,150
of like the the hackers challenge game

110
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,680
we have here where it's a board just

111
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,599
like a Jeopardy board and there are

112
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,340
columns and and different sections of

113
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,570
retro and potent poni bowls and

114
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,840
different things like that within the

115
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,669
columns there is attack and defense if

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,859
you've ever done pros versus Joe's of

117
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,049
b-sides or you've if you've did the red

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,710
versus blue in past years here at Saint

119
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,289
Con these are events are usually scored

120
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,090
but your your score goes up by keeping

121
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,159
your services up and your competitor

122
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,780
scores to go down by you taking their

123
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,139
services down so you're both attacking

124
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,280
and defending sometimes or some a little

125
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,169
bit later we talk about some of them are

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,729
more attack based some are more defense

127
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,710
based I took I mentioned the sink on

128
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,500
Labs those are attack based downstairs

129
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,989
they have the threat hunting village or

130
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,199
threat hunting event threat hunting

131
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,060
something but threat hunting is more

132
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,169
defense based defensive base there's

133
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,430
some of them that are just one or the

134
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,289
other

135
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,030
there are wargames which are like you

136
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,000
defend or exploit a vulnerability to

137
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,440
prevent access or these are often ones

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,460
you download and just do what your own

139
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,919
time and at your own pace

140
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,479
there are simulated pin tests which is

141
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,889
just what it sounds like it's kind of

142
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,030
like the same kind of labs but there are

143
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,860
different things some of these are just

144
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,289
bad challenges like if you've been to a

145
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,240
conference and been a badge did anyone

146
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:25,159
go to b-sides this year 2019 b-sides I

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,409
don't see I don't see professor plum in

148
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,539
here but he did like the single greatest

149
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,400
badge hacking badge I've ever seen at

150
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:35,229
besides this year I see your beside

151
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,229
shirt do you did you play the badge

152
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,150
these badges are more than just a badge

153
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,590
this one included I haven't done the

154
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,150
challenges here so I can't speak for if

155
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,950
this was how good the challenges on this

156
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,280
one are but I know that there are some

157
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,870
badges that are fantastic like the the

158
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,260
b-sides badges this year taught you how

159
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,930
to do buffer overflows and how to find

160
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,639
Canaries and and bypassed canary checks

161
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,620
on your buffer overflows and things like

162
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,290
that and that was just from a badge that

163
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,560
came out at the conference so some of

164
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,880
this ETFs our badge based a lot of them

165
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,440
are crypto based some of them are

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,210
certification based like the osep

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,610
certification is pretty much just a

168
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,690
giant CTF challenge that they give you

169
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,190
24 hours to do this big to compromise

170
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,080
these systems and write a report about

171
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,940
it and then most CTFs are mix and match

172
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,800
their combination some of this and some

173
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:32,560
of that and some of call me and some of

174
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,290
call um be so next let's talk a little

175
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,550
bit about who should place ETFs and I

176
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,350
think this slide was supposed to have a

177
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,080
picture but then I went to sleep so it

178
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:47,440
doesn't but so for who should place ETF

179
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,479
let's talk a little bit oh it's slow

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,880
animation it does have stuff so

181
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,580
everybody should play CTF so everyone in

182
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,770
here should take time to play it and no

183
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,500
seriously I really mean it everybody

184
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,180
should play CTF that's your boss that's

185
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,560
your wife that's your kids that's

186
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,530
everybody the whole point is to educate

187
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,000
and learn and wouldn't it be better if

188
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,400
all these people knew a little bit more

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,560
about what a CTF was so let's talk about

190
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,330
why should all why should everybody why

191
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,750
should ever all these people be involved

192
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,550
in CTFs these are some of the different

193
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,660
things as I was reading about this and

194
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,820
as I've talked to people and thought

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,490
about it these are what you can some of

196
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,139
what you can get out of CTFs getting

197
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,510
started in cybersecurity is a very

198
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,459
common thing tons and tons of people use

199
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,809
CTF to get their start to get their foot

200
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,699
in the door to start the learning

201
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,689
process

202
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,610
everyone says go to college and get a

203
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,860
degree I think that opens a lot of doors

204
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,479
for you but honestly they aren't going

205
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,520
to teach you anything about your day job

206
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,160
and if you're not doing CTF to learn

207
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,420
about your day job then

208
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,490
you're not gonna do very good at your

209
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,479
day job day one when you start so you

210
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,399
might as well start learning these

211
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,519
real-world skills sooner rather than

212
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,519
later

213
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,690
professional development I told you I

214
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,029
was a system administrator I did VMware

215
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,430
and storage administration I did Linux

216
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,399
administration before that and I wanted

217
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,229
to do more in the security realm and I

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,629
needed to develop those skills so that I

219
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,600
had appeal and value to my employer and

220
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,100
that role and so I played with CTF they

221
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,300
did things like that to develop those

222
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,709
skills to learn CTF literally are

223
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,800
learning if you're if you're playing

224
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:30,239
you're probably learning to get a job

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,810
whether it's a better job or your first

226
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,170
job

227
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,849
there are tons and tons of CTFs that are

228
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,889
out there that companies use them as a

229
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,040
recruiting tool companies use them as a

230
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:44,220
tool to weed out the candidates they do

231
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,719
and don't want to hire and there are

232
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,110
competitions that happen like that in

233
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Utah several times a year

234
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,779
I know Lucid puts them on I've heard of

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,069
like three in the last since the summer

236
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:04,589
that these different companies do to

237
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:08,310
recruit and weed out applicants I put to

238
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,750
get married that's up there because as I

239
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,569
was listening to a podcast about this

240
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,050
does anybody know who parliament had a

241
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:19,079
plaid Parliament pony that PBP know who

242
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:22,740
they are so one thing I see started PvP

243
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:25,109
he actually met his wife on PvP and they

244
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,899
got married because they were on the

245
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,000
same CTF team together if you don't know

246
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,029
who PPP are they are Carnegie Mellon has

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,990
a CTF team they're the people behind

248
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:38,339
picot CTF if you've ever played that but

249
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,309
they are also the people who have won

250
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,730
the DEFCON CTF like five times six times

251
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:47,339
something like that they pretty much

252
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,779
that right now according to the rankings

253
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,220
they're the second best team in the

254
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,370
world but they're pretty much

255
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,279
historically and traditionally the best

256
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,750
CTF team in the world but yeah the guy

257
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,089
one of the guys who started that got

258
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,830
Marek met his wife on the team and got

259
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,540
married to her so

260
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,040
you know it can go anywhere you can be

261
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,000
friends you can get married you do all

262
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,589
kinds of stuff with the CTF let's just

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,060
take a second is anybody in here how

264
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,040
many people got their start in cyber

265
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,599
security what CTF how many of you have

266
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,819
done professional development through

267
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,589
CTF how many of you have learned a

268
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,579
little bit through a CTF I mean this

269
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,760
should be everybody who's done what I

270
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:32,449
hope anybody in here found a better job

271
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,860
through CTF I was as I was preparing

272
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,529
this presentation I was talking to

273
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,640
people I had at least three people tell

274
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:43,459
me stories about how they started the

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,810
game to play and have fun and then after

276
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,099
playing for a little bit somebody

277
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,920
approached them and they got a different

278
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,269
thing and it led to much different

279
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,860
career paths and they have received

280
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,600
gotten jobs there are people at this

281
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,670
conference that are here and have their

282
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,470
job because of CTF everyone in here i if

283
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,709
you've done how many people have met

284
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,060
friends and met new people through CTF

285
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:08,540
is there anyone who's gotten married

286
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,709
through a CTF in this room all right I

287
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,520
didn't really expect that one to be

288
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,520
there but you never know

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,470
so to get started in CTF the first thing

290
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,820
you need to do is you need to find a CTF

291
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,959
you need to find something to

292
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,490
participate in and get going with it and

293
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,640
there are literally hundreds of these

294
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,720
that you can go and do I definitely

295
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,890
don't have all of them this is one of

296
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,380
those slides where I'm hoping for

297
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,180
feedback and comments but really the

298
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,579
low-hanging fruit for you is you're here

299
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,989
at st. Conn get pull up the hackers

300
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:42,469
challenge board and start working on

301
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:46,160
those the uber board it gets really hard

302
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,660
really fast but it's not a race you

303
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,360
don't have to be the best you just have

304
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,800
to play it and you have to try it so try

305
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,149
the challenge as you can if you can't

306
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
get them then don't give up go

307
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,779
downstairs there's a whole area all the

308
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,430
couches downstairs on the first floor is

309
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,560

310
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,849
around you and get help and figure these

311
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,619
out and learn if you want to do more war

312
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,690
game things you've got vuln up you've

313
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,180
got on the wire or over the wire

314
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,620
you've got hacked this site you've got a

315
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,680
whole bunch of things like this you have

316
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,279

327
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,180
bit more guidance and direction

328
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,040
Neverland is built for first-time CTF

329
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,040
errs and it's awesome that they're here

330
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,990
yeah

331
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,180
that's later in my slides but yeah

332
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,950
that's perfect that just shows you all

333
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,599
of the upcoming CTS and it shows you the

334
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,250
rankings of what teams are scoring the

335
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:01,089
best and doing the best there it's an

336
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,470
awesome site CTF x org o we Chow I don't

337
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,850
think that one's in my side deck but yes

338
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,920
I've been there

339
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,130
we child out nets also a site that has

340
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,899
some of the stuff anyone else want to

341
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,790
throw something out there there there

342
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,170
are literally if you just Google for CTF

343
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,959
there are literally hundreds of sites

344
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,219
that pop up and go to them and play with

345
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:25,890
them and see what you can find about

346
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:25,890
them wait for it wait for it

347
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:39,550
okay I guess I can see it over here kind

348
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,740
of so the next thing is pace yourself I

349
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,599
talked a little bit about how there are

350
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,770
different

351
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,100
CTS come in all different varieties they

352
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,150
also come in all different skill sets

353
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,770
part of it is you need to acknowledge

354
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,199
your skill set a little bit and have a

355
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,670
little bit of an honest conversation CTS

356
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,560
are about challenging yourselves and

357
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,050
learning more and getting to the next

358
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,430
level but at the same time if you jump

359
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,680
right in and try to go off the deep end

360
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,839
you're gonna give up and walk away and

361
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,280
hate them and think they're stupid

362
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,860
I mentioned Neverland is a great

363
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,300
beginner one it's set up for that but to

364
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,070
give you an idea of where you can really

365
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:18,010
go with this and how crazy they get for

366
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:21,520
the DEFCON 2017 CTF they literally wrote

367
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,540
their own processor but so you guys all

368
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,300
know what little-endian and big-endian

369
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,069
are right I guess you may not the way

370
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,420
your computer reads bits is it it reads

371
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,310
it from the right or reads it from the

372
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,910
left and ones it ones little-endian ones

373
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,229
big endian well for DEFCON 2017 they

374
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,650
decided that was too easy

375
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,270
so they made Middle Indian where it

376
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:44,140
starts in the middle and goes out to the

377
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:48,069
edges does did anyone do any of the pre

378
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,230
con challenges this year you remember

379
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:54,280
how you had to use gdb to figure out

380
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,840
pre-con - was it free con - you had to

381
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,860
use the debugger to go in and figure out

382
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,440
the binary

383
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,270
yeah they decided that was too easy so

384
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,130
they purposely broke that by writing

385
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,140
their own computer architecture so

386
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,750
before you could do the challenge you

387
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:12,640
had to write gdb then you can work on

388
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:15,550
the challenge after that CTFs go so far

389
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,090
down the rabbit hole it's insane so part

390
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:22,810
of it is acknowledge your skillset and

391
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:28,540
don't don't say tomorrow I'm gonna go do

392
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:32,619
the DEFCON CTF because you're not there

393
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,180
are people who are that very very deep

394
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,820
down the rabbit hole and so start easy

395
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,949
be successful start where you can go do

396
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,040
the neverland CTF do the Pico CTF

397
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,149
download some voltages do things that

398
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,680
you can

399
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,300
complete and be accomplished and

400
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,040
accomplished so that you don't get

401
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,579
discouraged and just frustrated and hate

402
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,399
it if you want to learn about it the DEF

403
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:56,529
CON 2017 CTF clemency is the name of the

404
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,259
architecture they made but they had to

405
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,860
make emulators for KVM so that they

406
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,019
could run

407
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,650
they ran virtual computers off of this

408
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:09,459
and processor architecture they like

409
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:11,470
full-on from a competition standpoint

410
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,630
it's mind-blowing to me that they were

411
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,829
successful in creating this architecture

412
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,449
and everything that went with it but

413
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,668
then from a competitor standpoint I

414
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,140
can't imagine what it was like to show

415
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:22,149
up and realize that all of your tools

416
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,770
were totally useless and you had to

417
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:27,520
write them all from scratch before you

418
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,230
could even start competing anyway that

419
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,760
was the clemency story really cool if

420
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,720
you want to hear about that you can

421
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:39,190
research about a little bit the next

422
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,950
thing with CTF is don't do it alone like

423
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,350
find a friend talk to the guy next to

424
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,899
you if you are working on a hacker's

425
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,779
challenge right now it's at Saint Con

426
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,219
there are hundreds of people working on

427
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,809
it there are people working on the exact

428
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,059
same challenge you are don't be afraid

429
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:58,149
to walk up to them and say hey let's

430
00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:00,460
let's talk about this I'm gonna pick on

431
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:03,219
my son he's I might I have a 15 year old

432
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,809
boy that came to con this year and I had

433
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,990
the laugh at him yesterday because you

434
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:11,559
guys all know SJ he's on the committee

435
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:15,700
for st. Conn anyway Seth was he was

436
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:19,389
there and Seth walked up and we were at

437
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,490
the the community ops table our ops

438
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,679
platform down there and Seth locks

439
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,149
Annan's and I hear him walk up to

440
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,270
somebody and say hey I don't know you

441
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,949
I'm Seth and I laughed because I had had

442
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,679
that exact discussion with my son like

443
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,570
two hours before saying what you need to

444
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,480
do is walk up to them and say hi I'm

445
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,480
Noah what's your name and if you're not

446
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,250
doing this you're not doing it right one

447
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
of the things is the networking aspect

448
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,559
the meeting other people the developing

449
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,120
friendships developing relationships

450
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,860
because nobody has all these skills

451
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,379
there's nobody right now that can sit

452
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,389
down and get everything on the hackers

453
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,750
challenge board without any googling or

454
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,049
any help or anything else

455
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,760
so rather than reinvent the wheel on

456
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,770
your own find somebody who does know

457
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,679
that stuff meet up with people be

458
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:11,629
friends with them get to know them and

459
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:15,130
so just remember the phrase is hi I

460
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,130
don't know you I'm Seth

461
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:24,110
with that join a team or join a group or

462
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,640
join a crowd of people doing this if

463
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,408
you're joining a team if you want to

464
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,600
competitively compete if you want to be

465
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:32,450
competitive with CTF if you want to

466
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,158
challenge people and move forward then

467
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,289
you need to really be on a team and

468
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:39,200
really train like a team like you think

469
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:42,129
of sports teams and how they meet for

470
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,059
three hours a day every day and they

471
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,250
practice and they go through and they do

472
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,590
things so that it becomes natural to

473
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,390
them they figure out what each person in

474
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,789
the team brings they learn the strengths

475
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,440
and weaknesses they leverage that they

476
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,990
find people who are different from each

477
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,270
other they you know the football teams

478
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,150
aren't all defensive linemen football or

479
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,789
basketball teams aren't all centers

480
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,320
soccer teams aren't all goalies you find

481
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,030
different people with different skill

482
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,250
sets that have something to come and

483
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,480
bring to their there are some positions

484
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,830
where you need two or three people in

485
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,110
that position there's some positions

486
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,939
where you only need one so as a part of

487
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,918
this find people that are different from

488
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,830
you and work with them and use them to

489
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:26,270
help you with this process and

490
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:28,250
strengthen the team find what you like

491
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,980
and specialize if you really find that

492
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,840
you're drawn to the reverse engineering

493
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,970
aspect and do that if you find that

494
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,010
you're really interested in the

495
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,929
cryptography do that whatever you like

496
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,140
do that just go down that rabbit hole

497
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:44,210
become the expert in that area and even

498
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,039
if you're not doing competitive CTF

499
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,549
these things still work because if you

500
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,379
come here I know that as I know I think

501
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,720
of the people that I've done CTS with

502
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm helped with saint's con hackers

503
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,270
challenge before I can tell you who I

504
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,059
see a crypto challenge I know okay I

505
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,168
need to go talk to this person I see

506
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,330
reverse engineering I need to go talk to

507
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,669
this and you get to know these people

508
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,418
and they know you as you build these

509
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,419
relationships

510
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:17,600
the next thing is don't stop I don't

511
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,629
know if anyone remembers Forrest Gump

512
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,279
from the 90s where he talks about how

513
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:26,988
for no particular reason I just kept on

514
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:28,940
going don't stop when the competition's

515
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:30,679
over keep keep working on it keep

516
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,960
learning about it one of the examples

517
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,129
was again that PPP was talking about one

518
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,440
of the competition's they did in Russia

519
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:40,969
and one of the challenges for this

520
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,909
competition they had to do some discrete

521
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,340
logarithmic calculations and they wrote

522
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:49,100
some code to do this to do the challenge

523
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,279
and do the logarithmic calculations and

524
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,609
they found their code ran and it took

525
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,830
about ten hours to run it finished about

526
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:59,418
15 minutes after the competition ended

527
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,059
so they got no points for any of those

528
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:05,090
challenges then he talked about how he

529
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:06,470
went back and decided he wanted to

530
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,959
figure out what was really going on with

531
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,940
that and he found some optimization

532
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,220
places work that he had missed and

533
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,769
writing the code and went down from ten

534
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,509
hours to a sorry was three hours not ten

535
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,190
hours I got my numbers based so it took

536
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,929
three hours thrown at the first time and

537
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,249
then he found some optimizations and it

538
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,999
went from three hours down to ten

539
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:27,950
minutes but what's awesome is he now has

540
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,480
these optimization optimizations next

541
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,889
time he hits that challenge he doesn't

542
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,409
have to write the ten hour solution

543
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:34,639
anymore he can write the ten doesn't

544
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,850
have the three hour solution anymore he

545
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:39,379
can write the ten minute solution

546
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,928
don't just complete the CTF for the

547
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:44,748
points complete it for the understanding

548
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,249
if you just go and it would it would be

549
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:48,470
pretty easy to go hang out downstairs

550
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:50,029
and honestly I have been the guy that

551
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,889
did this so I'm not pointing fingers

552
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:54,679
there's no condemnation in this at all

553
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:56,779
but to hang out and shoulder surf and

554
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,369
listen to people talk and hear the flags

555
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,480
and just type the flags in and get the

556
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:03,439
points on the board we've all done it it

557
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,419
it's the easy win

558
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,639
but at the same time you don't learn

559
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:09,320
crap you don't learn anything and the

560
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:13,369
whole point of this is to learn and to

561
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,289
grow so maybe not during the competition

562
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,789
but maybe earmark and say you know what

563
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:17,690
I got the right answer but I don't

564
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,490
really know how that worked

565
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,499
I'm gonna go back to that after the

566
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,730
competition after after hackers

567
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:26,990
challenge is closed I'm going

568
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,970
go back and see what I can do to figure

569
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,320
out what really happened to that don't

570
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,919
just play four points play for

571
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,918
understanding

572
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:42,770
next is two walkthroughs so this is

573
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,030
double sided there's two sides of

574
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,270
walkthroughs the first I'll walk through

575
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,040
as you walk through to gain you use

576
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,990
other walkthroughs already exist if

577
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,450
you're really getting started pick one

578
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,370
of the popular CTF Slyke the Pico CTF or

579
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,260
something and you if you google it

580
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,330
you'll find two kinds of hits you'll

581
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,470
find the hits that are how to get into

582
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,510
the competition and what to do with the

583
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,460
competition and the second kind of hit

584
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,379
you'll find is walk throughs people

585
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,120
telling you literally what to type and

586
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,919
what happens and they explain what each

587
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,889
step does and what happens in that part

588
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,630
of the process so go through and do

589
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,580
these walkthroughs if you're unsure if

590
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,919
you're just starting if you're new and

591
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,780
you don't have a lot of confidence then

592
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,120
don't beat yourself up for not knowing

593
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,860
that do the walkthroughs to learn but

594
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,959
then as you get more skill and you get

595
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,549
more confidence turn around and

596
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,250
contribute back to the community and

597
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:34,090
write your own walkthroughs every year

598
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,470
Josh asks for devlog ask for

599
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,909
walkthroughs for the hackers challenge

600
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,160
game he has for people to write and

601
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,290
contribute this is what I did to solve

602
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,120
that challenge to pay it forward and

603
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,299
teach the next group how they can solve

604
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,280
these problems and what they can do I

605
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,600
know that we all work in IT and

606
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,059
walkthrough sounds an awful lot like

607
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,010
documentation and documentation is kind

608
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:58,190
of like an evil terrible thing that no

609
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,480
one ever does or wants to do but really

610
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,740
you do learn through writing and

611
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,120
walkthroughs and creating this

612
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:08,140
documentation the next thing is there

613
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,030
are there are real-world kickbacks with

614
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,900
with doing CTFs they're not just for you

615
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,760
they're for everybody

616
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,710
personal kickbacks we've talked about a

617
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,330
little bit you get personal development

618
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,190
you get job career opportunities you get

619
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,309
friendships you get relationships you

620
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:25,340
get all these things to benefit you

621
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,720
personally your employer one employer

622
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,659
doesn't want more highly skilled

623
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,940
employees who doesn't want employees to

624
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,940
understand more of what's going on even

625
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,410
if it's not exactly your area nobody I I

626
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,520
personally would not complain

627
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,500
if someone knew a little bit more

628
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,680
outside of their area about these types

629
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,680
of things

630
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:49,340
organizational think about st. Kahn and

631
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,080
how much the hackers challenge adds to

632
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,040
the conference from an organizational

633
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,230
perspective there are benefits to us for

634
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,409
hackers or for cts and for participating

635
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,050
these industry things there are the

636
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,090
there was an ffmpeg vulnerability found

637
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,770
not that long ago through CTF it was

638
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,840
they were using ffmpeg in one of their

639
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,889
CTF sand somebody saw the child solved

640
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,679
the challenge in a way they didn't

641
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,270
understand and it turns out ffmpeg had a

642
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
remote code execution at it that

643
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,139
somebody was leveraging and they used

644
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,640
that to win the CTF and it's awesome

645
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,890
because not only did they win in a

646
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,930
creative way but also they got to

647
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,640
responsibly disclose this bug and patch

648
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:30,920
software that we all use sometimes

649
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,540
you're gonna get stuck we talked about

650
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,380
choosing the right level and choosing

651
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,379
what's good for you

652
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:42,200
but make sure that the challenges you're

653
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,000
doing are appropriate for you and your

654
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,320
group that you're competing with but

655
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,110
sometimes you're gonna get stuck and

656
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,730
you're gonna get in over your head and

657
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,169
that's okay that's part of what this is

658
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,340
and that's part that's when you learn

659
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,280
the most least that's when I learned the

660
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,110
most is when I get stuck so join a group

661
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,370
and like I mentioned before the hackers

662
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,979
lounge is downstairs where all the

663
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,229
couches are in the expo space the whole

664
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,790
point of this is to help people and get

665
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,520
to know each other but again the secret

666
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:10,370
code where it is hi I'm Seth I don't

667
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
know you you need to talk to these

668
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,580
people don't just sit there and see

669
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,470
someone else and wonder if he's working

670
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,740
on the same thing as me we're gonna be

671
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:21,050
like hey have you solved

672
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,790
reverse-engineering 200 hey have you

673
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,080
solved this one and talk to them and get

674
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,920
to know them and see where they're at so

675
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,480
you can work together there are groups

676
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,480
at elementary schools high schools

677
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,000
colleges I mentioned DC 4 through 5 ni

678
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,330
men there's DC 208 there's 801 labs

679
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,880
there's loads of these groups all over

680
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,580
if there's not then start one it really

681
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,540
was Pope and I sat and talked at besides

682
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,800
a year ago and said he said hey I'm

683
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,789
moving to Logan do you guys have any

684
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,408
sort of defconn

685
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,299
or hacker groups at meat and I said no

686
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:55,789
let's do that let's get together let's

687
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,918
let's get a group going and now we meet

688
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,330
once a month and we have about 35 people

689
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,369
that show up and we talk about this kind

690
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:06,320
of stuff every month month in and month

691
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:08,869
out so find these groups find slack if

692
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,539
you're here at st. Con and stuck on the

693
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:13,369
hackers challenge zebb lag loves to help

694
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,899
people the reason he does this is

695
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:16,369
because he loves to teach people he

696
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,529
wants you to he wants to be there and

697
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:20,299
help you so reach out to him if you're

698
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:22,039
afraid and you don't know anybody use me

699
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:24,289
as your excuse come talk to me and I'll

700
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,369
talk to anybody and you want you wanna

701
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:27,109
find somebody I'll help you find

702
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,309
somebody to help you I probably can't

703
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:30,739
help you because like I said I'm not the

704
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,908
most skilled at these but I can probably

705
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:34,940
point you in the right direction for

706
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:37,700
someone that can help you but talk to

707
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,960
people and that one of the downsides is

708
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,809
we try to come to these conferences and

709
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,269
hide and not talk to anybody but really

710
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:45,590
the in my mind half the point is the

711
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,739
relationships and the people have the

712
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,728
reason to come to the con happens to

713
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:53,809
everyone even the big boys get stuck

714
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,099
don't feel bad don't get down on

715
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:56,389
yourself just because you're getting

716
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,979
stuck on a challenge it doesn't mean

717
00:28:56,389 --> 00:29:00,649
you're bad doesn't mean you're not smart

718
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:05,389
it just means that the gamemaster wrote

719
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:08,330
a good challenge next I want to talk a

720
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:11,959
little bit about giving back and so with

721
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:15,109
giving back as we as you get better at

722
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,849
these and as you want to do more it's

723
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:18,139
great to give back and to share some of

724
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:20,178
what you've learned with the community

725
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:23,629
to build it and make it better for

726
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:25,879
people behind so and I have all honestly

727
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:28,099
learned more giving building things that

728
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:29,330
I have participating them but parlous

729
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,389
because I've spent more time building on

730
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,999
that anyway but things you can do is

731
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:37,939
every CTF knees challenge is zev like

732
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:40,369
every year asks for more challenges for

733
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,899
the hackers challenge game you can

734
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:43,609
create challenges for the hackers

735
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:44,840
challenge game and participate the

736
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,478
hackers challenge game it does not

737
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,099
exclude you from participating he has a

738
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:51,619
couple of rules about how you can do it

739
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:54,229
but you can create you can contribute

740
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:56,119
puzzles and still participate every year

741
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:57,769
I'm looking for content for the labs if

742
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,590
you want to make environments for people

743
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,519
to attack and compromise then let's do

744
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,720
it let's get this going

745
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,789
organize a game I mentioned in Neverland

746
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,159
CTF guys though that was literally a

747
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:12,440
group of high school kids they went I

748
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,899
they went to a conference learned about

749
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,309
a CTF and had a lot of fun doing it and

750
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,869
thought this is awesome we should do it

751
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,658
more and there they couldn't find

752
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:22,789
anything so they built their own and now

753
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,259
they take it too they did at Def Con at

754
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:26,509
roots asylum they had a whole room

755
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:30,529
barricade offer them at Def Con for the

756
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:33,350
kids section to talk about or to teach

757
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,989
these little kids how to do CTF and this

758
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,369
was just a bunch of there at college now

759
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:40,220
they're out of high school but these are

760
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:41,600
just you know young guys and girls that

761
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,460
decided they wanted more of this and

762
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,498
they made it happen

763
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,970
create a group of team I mentioned how

764
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,869
easy it is to make a Def Con group and

765
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,690
if you don't want to make a Def Con

766
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:55,279
group then make a make a st. Con group

767
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:56,450
make a left hallway on third floor of a

768
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,649
group I don't care like make whatever

769
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,070
you want but find people to work with

770
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:02,899
these things on you help your neighbor

771
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,730
if you hear somebody struggling you hear

772
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,869
you hear group that's fighting through

773
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,019
something that you've already solved

774
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:11,330
this is not a zero-sum game I mean there

775
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,859
are three people that are if you look at

776
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:16,189
the at least the way I look I look at

777
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:17,869
the board and I was I one time I was a

778
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,580
guy that was competing in the top spots

779
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:22,789
but pretty much I'm a bottom-feeder and

780
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,559
so if I give someone else the knowledge

781
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,600
to solve a puzzle it doesn't it doesn't

782
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,369
hurt me in any way I'm not taking away

783
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,779
my chances of winning by someone else

784
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:33,499
doing it because I already had no chance

785
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,999
of winning but that was we talked about

786
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,379
making walkthroughs that's another way

787
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:37,999
you can give back you can go through

788
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:39,738
later and write up write these up for

789
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:41,929
other people to come behind so that

790
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:43,399
people who don't understand this can

791
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:46,340
then follow in your footsteps and do the

792
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:49,248
same kinds of things this next bit here

793
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,049
other resources this is where I want

794
00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:54,320
more feedback these are some of the

795
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:57,549
things that I've done apparently have a

796
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,600
typo that I didn't pay attention to

797
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,070
these are some of the places that I

798
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,009
watch for things that some of the places

799
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:08,119
I get information about these CTF time

800
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:10,609
that was mentioned over the wire reddit

801
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,249
the Security CTF subreddit is actually

802
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:15,860
pretty good some of the groups I put in

803
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:17,540
there Edelen labs DC 4 3 5 sorry

804
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,178
see too late I didn't know your website

805
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,409
and I was too tired to Google I don't

806
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:24,230
know that's really a thing but that's

807
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,880
gonna have a feel my typo is that's

808
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:29,179
actually supposed to say darknet diaries

809
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,350
if you are a guy or girl who likes

810
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:35,780
podcasts I highly recommend that's Jack

811
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:39,290
reciters podcast and it's fantastic

812
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,540
he basically interviews people who do

813
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,280
CTFs he interviews people who have been

814
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,470
