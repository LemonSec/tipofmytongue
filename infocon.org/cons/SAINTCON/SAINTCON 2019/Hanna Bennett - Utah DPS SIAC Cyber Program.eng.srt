1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,550
good all right good morning everyone so

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,170
my name is Hannah Bennett I work for the

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,910
Utah Department of Public Safety

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,830
statewide information and analysis

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,600
Center so my so I've been working for

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,259
the Department of Public Safety for

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,930
almost ten years in various roles so I

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,160
started to become interested in cyber

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,780
security at about 2014 and since then

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,148
I've been working hard to kind of mix a

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,980
job somehow with Public Safety and cyber

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,809
and now I am at the statewide

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,640
information and analysis center

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:51,360
so the syak and my job is to share cyber

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:54,660
threat information like slide I think

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,420
has a timer so I apologize

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,599
with our Utah public and private sector

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,519
partners so I work at the Utah fusions

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,610
the Utah fusion centers they were

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,110
created after 9/11 after it was

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,030
determined that we needed a better way

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,289
to share information between federal

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,060
state and local law enforcement agencies

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,790
fusion centers are a central location

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,420
that all agencies can come together to

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,290
detect investigate apprehend and respond

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,170
criminal terrorists and other activity

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,250
related to Homeland Security

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:38,430
our main focus is to provide analysis

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,549
and threat assessments for cyber threats

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:47,520
or all threats in fact so there are at

32
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,070
least one fusion center in every state

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,798
this graphic actioning is to be updated

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:02:00,119
we have now 80 fusion centers across the

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:03,090
nation so as far as our agency topology

36
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,509
so I work for the state of Utah that is

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,098
what our fusion center falls under

38
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,009
within the state of Utah we have the

39
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,420
Department of Public Safety within that

40
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,220
we actually have 11 divisions

41
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,440
one of them is a State Bureau of

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,130
Investigation they hand all like like

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,230
handle all of our investigation like on

44
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,930
a state level and assist local

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,670
jurisdictions and then we have the

46
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,770
statewide information and analysis

47
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,109
Center and that is the Intelligence

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,770
Division and so we handle the

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,990
intelligence threats then we have the

50
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,150
Department of Technology services they

51
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,450
handle all of our state of Utah

52
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,130
technology and then within that we

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,690
actually have a joint operation with the

54
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,060
Department of Technology Services and

55
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,700
the state and the Department of Public

56
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,010
Safety we have the Utah cyber center

57
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,329
which is housed at the Capitol where we

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,390
can all work together to share

59
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:06,880
information so within our fusion center

60
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,029
we are in all crimes a fusion center we

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,600
have six main focus areas we have

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,870
domestic terrorism organized crime

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:20,560
violent crime trafficking both drugs and

64
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:25,870
human trafficking gangs and then mine is

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:29,230
cyber we have also our intelligence

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:33,400
liaison officer program this is where we

67
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,840
have point of contacts for all of the

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,970
law enforcement agencies across the

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,280
state which works great if there is a

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,260
threat we have a point of contact

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,910
immediately to go ahead and contact them

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,690
it's also a point of contact for them to

73
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,829
receive intelligence and to share

74
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,620
intelligence that they get my job is

75
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,090
cyber and that doesn't really work with

76
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,910
law enforcement

77
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:05,440
I get indicators of compromise so these

78
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:10,269
are like malware signatures or they are

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,190
other indicators you give that to a law

80
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,239
enforcement officer and they have no

81
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,190
idea what to do with it

82
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,600
so my job is to make contact with IT

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,399
professionals administrators across the

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,640
state so right now

85
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,900
most of my IT professionals that I work

86
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,880
with are this

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,210
from the state of Utah so the Department

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,900
of Technology services both city and

89
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,599
county IT and then a lot of the

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,729
education sector representatives and

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,400
then other major critical infrastructure

92
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,659
warden

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,599
organizations so these are like your

94
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:52,610
major facilities or gas and water and

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,330
electricity Sark provides three main

96
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,210
services to our cyber Aiello's so we

97
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:05,599
have our threat notifications analysis

98
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:08,270
and information sharing the so as far as

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,139
the threaten of notifications so we

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:15,139
monitor open sources that hackers like

101
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:17,990
to post information on so this could be

102
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:22,000
account compromises possible website

103
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:25,520
defacement claims and other random

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,150
vulnerabilities as far as the analysis

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,430
and case support if you have an incident

106
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,840
in your organization and it needs to be

107
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:38,419
escalated to a lot enforcement status we

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,310
can go ahead and provide that referral

109
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,250
wherever it needs to go whether it's a

110
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,849
state level or a federal level with the

111
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:50,539
FBI and then the other thing that we

112
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:52,880
share is just the information sharing

113
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,889
aspect is the ability to share

114
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,659
intelligence products that come from a

115
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:04,039
federal level and give them a Utah

116
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:08,240
context so just a few examples of

117
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:11,389
successes that we have just with in like

118
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,970
since January I've sent out about 1,400

119
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,270
possible cyber threat notifications and

120
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,080
then about 70 intelligence products this

121
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,609
is like like examples could be the

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,880
account compromises or website

123
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:31,610
defacements some examples of that we had

124
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,440
last year we had this major sextortion

125
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,990
scam where people were getting emails

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,690
that had their password in the subject

127
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,370
line and it was saying that you need to

128
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,759
pay us Bitcoin or else we're going to

129
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,669
really

130
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,559
this video of you to all of your friends

131
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,688
and family of course it was fake but we

132
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:50,629
started receiving hundreds of these and

133
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:53,870
so my job was compiling these hundreds

134
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,610
and then actually submitting them to the

135
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,969
FBI and our State Bureau of

136
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,400
Investigation for investigation so that

137
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,610
that was a really good coordination

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,489
effort also data breaches we've had I've

139
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,830
haven't found too many but as far as new

140
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,559
breaches I found about three that the

141
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,399
victims were not aware of so we went

142
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:18,169
ahead and like notified them by phone

143
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,009
that they have been breached and then

144
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:26,270
went ahead and contacted all of the Utah

145
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:29,569
based victims that their accounts were

146
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,789
involved in a breach also botnets our

147
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:35,779
threat stream for botnets is fairly

148
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:38,180
small but it we are working on it there

149
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:41,120
are a few like botnet threat providers

150
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,409
that we have access to so still working

151
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,740
on that as far as exposed servers I find

152
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,688
hundreds of exposed servers with open

153
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,080
ports that should not be so these are

154
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,159
servers that have remote desktop

155
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,229
accessible just open and wide to the

156
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:02,560
internet or any other various threats we

157
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,568
also provide special event support so

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,779
with major events there is always the

159
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:11,930
threat of physical violence so we do

160
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:14,029
monitor social media just open social

161
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,610
media for that as well and then the

162
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:19,219
intelligence reporting increases in

163
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,139
reporting it doesn't just tell us like

164
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:22,969
that there was an attack that happened

165
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,110
but we want to know who and why and so

166
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,629
it gives us the attribution of attacks I

167
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,479
also just want to point out that we

168
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:35,680
understand organizations are hesitant to

169
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,190
share vulnerability information the syak

170
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:43,698
understands that this is very sensitive

171
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,209
information we don't want to out our

172
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:49,729
sources so please let us know we are not

173
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,339
a regulatory agency if you don't want us

174
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,020
to pass it on we don't have to I have

175
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,640
had a case where we had

176
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,540
intelligence community come back and ask

177
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:04,520
me who like who these victims were and I

178
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,319
have the ability to say no so these are

179
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,550
just a couple examples of open source

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,500
information that you can use it's just

181
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,540
information but you can use it to build

182
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,120
an intelligence platform of your own

183
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,680
just as far as open sources so this is

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,460
where I get the majority of my account

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,370
compromises

186
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,800
this is pastebin hackers like to brag

187
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,590
that they have hack things or in

188
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,319
possession of hack things if you don't

189
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:38,030
have pastebin you shut you you can get a

190
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,590
free account and monitor at least your

191
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:44,660
own domain then if any time your domain

192
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,410
pops up it will send you an email and

193
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,980
it's pretty quick to triage through

194
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:56,180
another a good one is a zone H they also

195
00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:00,530
like to brag that they hack websites and

196
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:04,630
have the website defacements so there's

197
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:07,579
a plethora of Mir websites that will

198
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,310
mirror website if it was hacked these

199
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,620
are not necessarily good as like a quick

200
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,770
response as far as like like

201
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,410
notification but it's good research to

202
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,290
like to find out how many times you have

203
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,360
been targeted and then to be able to go

204
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,780
back to to reference or to see if an

205
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,850
actor has been doing this multiple times

206
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:33,530
multiple organizations another one to

207
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,300
show down if you don't have this

208
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,640
definitely get it I know with the free

209
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,680
account you are pretty limited and with

210
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,699
enterprise you can actually search for

211
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,689
like exploits or morale like custom

212
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,220
searches this I'll go ahead and if I get

213
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,680
a hit on something I will go to show

214
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,170
down to verify what everyone else can

215
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,959
see so these are just examples of three

216
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,839
sources of just threat information that

217
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,390
you can build to start building that

218
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,510
intelligence platform that you need for

219
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,439
your own organization so we do this for

220
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,870
our cyber partners so

221
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,610
if you want I can absolutely add you if

222
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,580
you are within the critical

223
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,680
infrastructure domain or part of state

224
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,390
local tribal and territorial but if

225
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:24,959
you're not you can absolutely do this on

226
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:27,120
your own so sharing information is so

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,100
important because that is how we develop

228
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,940
intelligence and I want to stress that

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,100
information is not intelligence

230
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,130
information is your data bases your raw

231
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,870
files your network logs all of those

232
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,750
tables that they were talking about in

233
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,410
one of the keynotes earlier yep from

234
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,900
yesterday that's just information the

235
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,199
intelligence aspect is the evaluation

236
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,030
and analysis of that information

237
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,970
specifically to give to our our key

238
00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,470
strategic decision makers and so these

239
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:04,080
would be like your like see so

240
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,930
legislators any County city officials or

241
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,970
your organisation's administration they

242
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:14,089
are the people that are asking questions

243
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:17,160
what do we do from here what makes sense

244
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:19,620
so they should be asking questions like

245
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,650
these if they don't you absolutely

246
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,300
should in an effort to understand your

247
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,860
own threat landscape the intelligence

248
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,770
cycle is how we answer all of these

249
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,650
questions planning is not only

250
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,410
developing what your key question is but

251
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,670
limiting the question in scope and

252
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,459
determining the resources that you will

253
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,339
need in order to actually answer it this

254
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:47,070
cycle is never complete it's always an

255
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,220
ongoing process we should always be

256
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:57,180
revisiting our questions and trying to

257
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:58,800
figure out what is new so one of the

258
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,859
biggest benefits of the Sayaka cyber

259
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,359
program is the massive amount of

260
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,839
resources that we have available to us

261
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,270
from the intelligence community so just

262
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,940
as a quick kind of overview we do have

263
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,550
the State Bureau of Investigation the

264
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,680
Division of Emergency Management the

265
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,900
Department of Technology Services the

266
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,858
Utah National Guard the Department of

267
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,379
Homeland Security and the

268
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:27,569
Bureau of Investigation we also partner

269
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,569
with the multi-state information sharing

270
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:32,779
an analysis center which is a part of

271
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:38,429
the Center for Internet security

272
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:40,829
so DHS has many functions I work

273
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,410
directly with two of them intelligence

274
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:46,919
and analysis they are the ones that

275
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,389
write reports after it happens so they

276
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,009
would get the indicators of compromised

277
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:53,489
pass it up to the intelligence community

278
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:56,369
to see if we can get attribution the

279
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:58,319
other one that I work directly with is

280
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:02,129
the cyber security and infrastructure

281
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:05,519
security agency they are more just

282
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:08,419
geared towards protecting the Gov domain

283
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,209
and securing our critical infrastructure

284
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:14,220
within there if you do fall under

285
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,868
critical infrastructure so this is the

286
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,889
information technology sector this is

287
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:24,689
the education sector does fall under

288
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:27,720
state local tribal and territorial so

289
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:29,579
you do as well you can get all of this

290
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,459
for free the cyber preparedness

291
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:34,469
strategic messaging and the the big one

292
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,419
is the cyber assessments they will do

293
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,459
vulnerability assessments for free they

294
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:44,129
do take a little bit of time but it is

295
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:49,409
free another resource that we have

296
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:51,089
access to is the FBI we have three

297
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:55,069
investigators with the State Bureau of

298
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:58,199
Investigation they do an amazing job

299
00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:00,029
working directly with the FBI and they

300
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,279
are able to take these smaller local

301
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:05,759
cases and escalate them up to a federal

302
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:09,479
level this is just one example like we

303
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,009
know just from cybercrime that victims

304
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,929
they're usually not in the same state

305
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,209
they're usually not even in the same

306
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:19,039
country and so the great lengths that

307
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:24,478
they have to go to to get prosecution is

308
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:26,579
amazing so huge shout-out to them but

309
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:30,869
what they do is they work with the FBI

310
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:34,680
cyber cyber unit and they will go ahead

311
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:39,389
and investigate not only the state level

312
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,878
also the federal level crimes so if you

313
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:44,339
have a cyber crime occur in your

314
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,249
organization report them report them to

315
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,490
either us or the IC 3 which is the

316
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:52,649
internet Crime Complaint Center it is

317
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,929
not just a database that no one looks at

318
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,910
we actually do look at them what happens

319
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,889
is the FBI will actually look at it see

320
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,579
what jurisdiction it falls under and

321
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:05,160
then send it to that organization or

322
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:07,290
that like that field office I also do

323
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,209
have access to it as well so if anything

324
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,410
happens and you need to submit a

325
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,839
complaint if you let me know you've

326
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,670
already submitted IC 3 I can go ahead

327
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,939
and just pull that so you don't have to

328
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,800
submit the exact same paperwork twice

329
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:27,569
another resource is InfraGard this is a

330
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,040
non-profit partnership between private

331
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:35,759
and public sector and the FBI so this is

332
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,529
how you would get their FBI intelligence

333
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,389
bulletins that are specifically meant

334
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:44,670
for the private sector if you're not

335
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:46,679
already subscribed to us so Isaac's the

336
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,079
information sharing and analysis Center

337
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,410
there is about 20 of them there are

338
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,569
they are sector specific I work directly

339
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,209
with the multi-state and elections

340
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:59,550
infrastructure iStock so I know those

341
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,979
two are free others you do have to pay

342
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,809
but they should have an

343
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,669
information-sharing

344
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:09,569
asset like center that is specific to

345
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:12,419
your organization it's some of them are

346
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,760
hitting missed but it's really good good

347
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:19,079
information that is relevant to your

348
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,179
sector for the most part so in the MSI

349
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,029
Sachs so the multi-state information

350
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:26,130
sharing an analysis Center they are part

351
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:27,839
of the center for internet security and

352
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,860
so you would know them with the CIS

353
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,250
controls so they are actually designated

354
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,500
by DHS as a key resource for cyber

355
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,850
threats for state local tribal and

356
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,600
territorial they do have a 24/7 sock and

357
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,340
it is free for SL t t so if you don't

358
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,520
have this and you are in the educate

359
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,159
or government sector please sign up it's

360
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,010
free and what you get as far as the free

361
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,010
access is the threat notifications they

362
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:04,060
also have a malicious code analysis

363
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,980
platform or M cap that is actually

364
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,129
pretty nice because you can also submit

365
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,320
URLs to it not just files they also

366
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:16,410
offer a vulnerability management program

367
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:19,120
and vulnerable learn vulnerability

368
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,890
assessments and then the best part is

369
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,459
the incident response if you have a

370
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:29,950
major breach or anything they can

371
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:31,990
respond for free so if you are an

372
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,660

373
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,300
