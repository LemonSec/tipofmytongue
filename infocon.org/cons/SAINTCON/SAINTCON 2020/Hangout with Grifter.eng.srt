dragged him out of the car dragged him

101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,120
to like try to stabilize the guy and

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
you know i was covered the guy was

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
covered in blood it was

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
bad um i was covered in blood then bart

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
was covered in blood

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
uh jason was covered in blood because he

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
was helping us carry him across the

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
street

113
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,440
and uh and then we talked to the cops

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
and gave him our names and phone numbers

115
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
and stuff and

116
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,079
then we went to walmart and bought a

117
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
change clothes

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,879
and changed in the walmart parking lot

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
so you can imagine what it looked like

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
to have a

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
three guys walking into walmart covered

122
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
in blood

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,519
um just walk up to the men's clothing

124
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
section pick out some clothes

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
go to the register buy them and then

126
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
change in the parking lot

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,959
but no one said a word to us you know

128
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,918
it's a normal day at walmart yeah

129
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,358
for a normal day at walmart i'm glad you

130
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,320
went to the men's clothing section to

131
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,280
get your clothes

132
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,080
yes you know well i mean that's uh we

133
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,198
were

134
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,599
honestly we probably should have gone to

135
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
the women's section i bet uh a skirt or

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
a dress

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
would have been nicer and more conducive

138
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,400
to airflow for a day we were about to

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,720
spend out in the middle of the desert

140
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
but yeah so that's what we did we um we

141
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,960
pulled some dude out of a

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,520
burning truck and it was incredibly hot

143
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,638
and there was a lot of smoke and it was

144
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
fully engulfed in flames but um

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,919
but yeah it was just kind of one of

146
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,320
those things where we're like if that

147
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,120
guy doesn't get out of there in the next

148
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
you know few seconds he's going to die

149
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,919
and he was literally

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
he was so out of it he was just sitting

151
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
there kind of like pawing at his

152
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,560
driver's side door

153
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,159
and we're like you have to come this way

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
and he was just

155
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
looking at us like we didn't really

156
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
exist um so he would have just sat there

157
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,240
and died

158
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
which we didn't want to um have take

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
place so

160
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
so yeah there we go we got dragged a guy

161
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,280
out of a burning car

162
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,599

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
and um it's really bright because the

170
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,359
sun is reflecting off of it as well it's

171
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,199
super bright

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
but um you know we went out there and

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
flew drones and

174
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,479
hiked around on the dunes and you get

175
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,919
disoriented really fast

176
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,199
um but it was a lot of fun nice

177
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,719
well awesome yeah all right i'll ask the

178
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,639
next next question then we'll just open

179
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,400
it up to the group but uh you know

180
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800

181
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,719
uh

182
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
with defcon black hat and some of these

183
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
other conferences but

184
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
you know one of the questions we often

185
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,400
get asked about saint kahn is

186
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
how do how how do you get involved in

187
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,599
those kinds of things

188
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
and such so what i'd like to do is just

189
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,759
prompt you to talk to us a little bit

190
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,799
about

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
your story about how you got involved in

192
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,759
defcon for the first time

193
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,800
how that worked out and and then

194
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,440
what what it became after that sure

195
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
um so i mean i'll i'll start by saying

196
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,039
like

197
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,080
normally like volunteering to do things

198
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
or

199
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
um i don't know putting myself out there

200
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
in a more

201
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
extroverted nature goes against what my

202
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
normal nature is which is much more

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,960
introverted

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,800
um but i do um i do generally like

205
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,960
hackers um and so

206
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
it actually started out i think it was

207
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,318
defcon

208
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,520
nine where i um

209
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,080
i met russ rogers who was the at the

210
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,120
time the lead vendor goon for the vendor

211
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
area which was

212
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,840
very very small at the time um but i was

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
selling t-shirts so i always made a

214
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
t-shirt

215
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
every year from defcon 8 i think defcon

216
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
21

217
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,960
i would make a t-shirt and go sell them

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
and it helped you know fund the trip and

219
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,239
and then some for some toys and stuff

220
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,000
like that um

221
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,080
and you know uh just from

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
from chatting with russ again as a goon

223
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
and stuff he was like

224
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
he's like oh man you know have you ever

225
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
thought about gooning or doing anything

226
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,080
like that and i'm like

227
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
yeah it sounds like um you know it's

228
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
it's one it sounds like work

229
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,799
um two it sounds like socialness um and

230
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,800
being outside of my comfort zone

231
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,319
uh but you know he he kind of

232
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,599
convinced me that it would be a good

233
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,479
thing um at the time at defcon it was

234
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,039
much more like you know a much smaller

235
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,318
group

236
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,000
i think there were probably 20 something

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
or 30 goons at the time

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,520
um which is now like the size of my team

239
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
at defcon

240
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
let alone all of the goons i think we're

241
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,159
closer to like 300 goons

242
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,479
um so i ended up getting an invitation

243
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,080
to come and goon

244
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,080
back then when you started out you

245
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,758
always started as a security goon

246
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,758
so for the first year that i was at

247
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
defcon i was a security goon and just

248
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,840
patrolled the pools back and forth

249
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,318
between the alexis park

250
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
pools which was interesting to say the

251
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,720
least

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,199
um if anybody was there in the alexis

253
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,919
park days they know what i mean

254
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
and um and yeah it was just a good time

255
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,838
and then eventually i moved over into

256
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
being a vendor goon with russ and with

257
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
chris hurley

258
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
chris is was the one who started the

259
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,399
worldwide war drive

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,560
um contest and um you know

261
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
wrote the first war driving book and

262
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,518
that kind of thing so he was

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
the other vendor going in it was just

264
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,640
myself and russ and chris

265
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,120
and then um honestly i kind of

266
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
i started to get burnt out a little bit

267
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
on um

268
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
on all the things that i was doing like

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,440
i was like i said a vendor

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,480
at defcon from eight onward i was a goon

271
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,720
from you know nine onward i was

272
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,600
um a speaker at defcon 10 11

273
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
12 10 maybe 10 11 12 and 13 it might

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,959
have been

275
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,800
and then um i also

276
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,399
uh what else was i doing i was running

277
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
the scavenger hunt with um

278
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
with luke with wi-fi luke who's on here

279
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
and conf

280
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,200
um if you guys know comp from st khan as

281
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
well um

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
so luke conf deadhead

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,600
and myself um and you know a couple

284
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
other 801 guys we ran the scavenger hunt

285
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
for defcon from

286
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,319
defcon 10. i don't correct me if i'm

287
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,160
wrong luke

288
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,600
um yeah i think it was 10 to like

289
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,800
13 or something like that um

290
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,040
and so being a contest organizer a goon

291
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
a vendor a speaker and all whatever just

292
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,000
started to

293
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,640
be too much and so after defcon 13 i

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
told um dt that i was going to be done

295
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
gooning

296
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,920
and he was like no don't don't do that

297
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
like you know stick around

298
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
um and he's like we're we're moving to a

299
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
new hotel

300
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
next year which nobody had known at the

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
time and that was when we were moving to

302
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,720
the river

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,079
and he's like and we're gonna have these

304
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
things um

305
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,120
that are called sky boxes and i'll take

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,399
you over and show you those sky boxes

307
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,160
um and you can basically

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,920
decide how people get to earn one of

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
those sky boxes because they looked out

310
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,479
over the contest area and ctf area

311
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
and they were really cool if you have

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,600
attended a def con at the rib

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,120
and so it was my job to one

314
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
convince people that they wanted a

315
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,760
skybox um and then

316
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,760
have them try to earn it essentially

317
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,439
and then manage the the parties that

318
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
inevitably would happen in them

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,839
at night so the way that you could get a

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,319
skybox to partying at night

321
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
was by doing some type of content during

322
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,680
the day to get it

323
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,279
and it's actually that um like defcon 14

324
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,199
the first year at the riv

325
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,720
that spawned um the lockpick village

326
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,320
um so those guys from the guys that most

327
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,600
of them were from tule at the time

328
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
wanted to have a party and they were

329
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
like

330
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
okay if we want one of these spaces we

331
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,800
have to do something during the day what

332
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
if we just bring in a bunch of locks and

333
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,439
then we'll like teach people how to pick

334
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
locks and we'll do whatever and we're

335
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
like that'd be great that'd be awesome

336
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,720
and then the wi-fi um the wi-fi village

337
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
followed

338
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
and then um the hardware hacking village

339
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,079
followed

340
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,279
and um the 303 folks they wanted to have

341
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,640
a party they wanted to have a three or

342
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,200
three party in a skybox

343
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,639
and that is how the sky talks started

344
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
which is why they're called skytalks

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
because they used to be

346
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
in the sky box um they're not so much in

347
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
the sky anymore but

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
but that's how the name carries on so

349
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,160
yeah it like just started out as like

350
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,079
talking to people eventually like

351
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
volunteering to do something

352
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,120
saying oh yeah we can do that oh and i

353
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,800
also forgot

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
um one of the other things that we were

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,639
doing um between like again like

356
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,680
wi-fi luke comp and myself were

357
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
um we also ran the defcon movie channel

358
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
at the alexis park which was essentially

359
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,319
like pirate television

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
it started out where um somebody just

361
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,600
hijacked the

362
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:36,000
um the um the feed into the hotel

363
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,959
television network and was just playing

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,560
like dumb videos and like random stuff

365
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,160
on it and we were like oh we could

366
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,319
actually do something with that

367
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,639
and then so for years um 2600 slc you

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
know

369
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,680
dc801 whatever we ran the um

370
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,920
we ran the movie channel for con as well

371
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,079
so we would stream movies off of a

372
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,719
server that we brought with us

373
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,959
that um that played all kinds of hacker

374
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
movies and then we'd have like uh matrix

375
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,319
at midnight or like the anime hour and

376
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,560
like every

377
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839
like every day there was just different

378
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
content and it was published in the

379
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,680
program like what times different movies

380
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,439
were gonna show and that was super super

381
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
fun but again it's just one more thing

382
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
to do

383
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,079
so i guess that's a very very long

384
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
answer to

385
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,399
never stop never say no

386
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
like i guess that's what it is

387
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,000
unpunished that's what that is

388
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,959
exactly and so yeah we um

389
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
utah was very very much a big part of of

390
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,479
the early defcon days and the utah crew

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
again some of whom still are around and

392
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,880
are now part

393
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,639
of the saintcon staff it uh

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
we've always had a really good community

395
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,320
here and people who wanted to get

396
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,600
involved and just do

397
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,600
cool stuff um also like there used to be

398
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
a voice bridge that was the defcon voice

399
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
bridge

400
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,399
where um and i used to call into this

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,120
back when i was like a kid like i was

402
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,680
like

403
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,279
12 13 14 years old whatever calling into

404
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,079
this voice bridge that was the def con

405
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,760
voice bridge

406
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,519
and it was actually hosted out of aurum

407
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,360
it was an 801

408
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,480
um so when i eventually moved to utah

409
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,639
um i was like oh 801 i know 801. that's

410
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,639
where the defcon voice bridge is so

411
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,160
um utah's got um a lot of defcon routes

412
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
as well

413
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,000

favorite anime give me a couple

439
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
favorites

440
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
okay i'm with you it's hard to pick

441
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,160
there's there are anime that like

442
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,959
there's one that like really really

443
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
hooked me

444
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,758
when um when i initially got into anime

445
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,399
um and it was death note like i know

446
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,720
that that

447
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,160
is is when it comes to anime that's a

448
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
pretty basic answer

449
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
right it's like what a basic it

450
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,240
might as well be death note pumpkin

451
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,560
spice right

452
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
um because death note is a really really

453
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,079
popular anime

454
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,480
but um but it was travis kerlock who was

455
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,160
one of the technical leads at um at

456
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
black hat who

457
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,600
who actually got me into anime both him

458
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
and dt

459
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,759
we took a trip to um tokyo

460
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
in 2006. um that's actually where i met

461
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,480
el cantaro for the first time

462
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,079
um and they were way into anime

463
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,920
now i wasn't i was totally down with

464
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,479
going to japan because i feel like

465
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,399
a trip to japan or a trip to tokyo is

466
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
kind of like going to mecca for a nerd

467
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,759
right you must make a pilgrimage there

468
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,480
at least in one point in your life

469
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,920
um and so i was really stoked to go and

470
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
we were doing a bunch of cool stuff and

471
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,839
then eventually

472
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,279
um eventually they dragged me into this

473
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,480
place called animate

474
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,560
and it was a store that was

475
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
i didn't realize how big it was we went

476
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,758
in and we were looking at stuff and we

477
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
were in there for probably like 45

478
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
minutes to an hour

479
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
and then i was like all right well

480
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,079
should we go

481
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,359
do something else like we've been in

482
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,959
this freaking store forever and as

483
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
someone who wasn't into anime i was just

484
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,479
like

485
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
i don't know what you guys are so

486
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
excited about they would just run from

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
aisle to aisle like screaming oh it's

488
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,320
this oh it's this

489
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,520
um and then um

490
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,039
when they did uh uh

491
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
what they did was they said what do you

492
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,280
mean we're going somewhere else they're

493
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839

494
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,119
this is only one floor and i'm like well

495

496
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,958

497
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,480
six i was like oh i'm done and i went

498
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,520

my camera i was like

500
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,119
tell me when you guys are done um and

501
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
and then on that same trip i went back

502
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,918
to my hotel

503
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,840
at some point and i was just just had

504
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
the tv on and there was this anime that

505
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,959
was

506
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
um that was on the tv and i was like oh

507
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
this seems kind of cool there was like

508
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
this

509
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,400
i really like the animation style it had

510
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
this like old

511
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,200
english kind of there was like magic

512
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,080
elements and different stuff and i'm

513
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,640
like what is this

514
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
so i called dt in his hotel room and i'm

515
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,880
like hey turn on channel 2

516
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,880
tell me what this anime is he's like i

517
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
have no idea and i'm like you are no use

518
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
to me

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,400
um so i hung up with him and i called

520
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,280
travis's room and i'm like hey channel 2

521
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
what's this anime no idea um so i ended

522
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
up waiting until the show was over and i

523
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,760
wrote down

524
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,120
any english word like anything that

525
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,440
would have written in

526
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,479
our alphabet you know like that i could

527
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,080
understand

528
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
um on a piece of paper and i was like

529
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,559
i'll just google it and see what i can

530
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,520
come up with

531
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,200
and i got nothing and then um probably

532
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
about a month later i came across that

533
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
piece of paper again and i googled it

534
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,760
again

535
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,200
and what had happened essentially was i

536
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,400
was watching the first

537
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
episode of the first ever airing of a

538
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
new anime which was called d

539
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
gray man and if you are into anime and

540
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,240
you

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,520
um and you know d grey man you'll know

542
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,840
it's a great show

543
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,960
but i had just stumbled upon something

544
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
brand new

545
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
and and anime is just like on tv you

546
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,639
know like it's on

547
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,120
normal network television in tokyo so um

548
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,400
so i was like oh crap i'm gonna check

549
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,559
this thing out and it is

550
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,919
also an incredible anime but i've

551
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,520
watched so much anime

552
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
i turned into the biggest anime nerd

553
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
over the course of that year because

554
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
then i

555
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,320
started watching d gray man and i was

556
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,840
like oh that's really good and i said to

557
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
travis what should i watch and he's like

558
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,879
watch death note

559
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,160
i watched death note and i was like holy

560
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,559
crap like that was amazing

561
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
and i was hooked and i just got online

562
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,918
essentially and i was like

563
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,200
top 50 anime and i watched all of them

564
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,720
like top 50 movies top 50 series

565
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,440
and i just went through them

566
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,320
systematically like a lunatic hacker

567
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
does right

568
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
um like this is the type of thing that

569
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,400
we do where it's like okay

570
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,600
this is a thing and i'm gonna learn

571
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,919
about this thing now it is my obsession

572
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
and i started speaking at anime

573
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,200
conventions

574
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,280
and like i volunteered at anime bonsai

575
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,760
which is the local anime

576
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,399
con here in utah like of course like

577
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,679
anything else i just take things too far

578
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,799
but um but yeah death note was was

579
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,200
what really hooked me hard

580
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,160
but there's incredible stuff out there

581
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
um

582
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,640
tokyo magnitude 8.0 is super super good

583
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,480
um if you want to watch a really good

584
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,880
anime that's like surviving in a

585
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,600
disaster like scenario

586
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,120
but my favorite right now is called food

587
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,399
wars

588
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,959
and i know that um

589
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
it's the weirdest freaking show i love

590
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,640
that show

591
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,320
thank you for also loving it um

592
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
i've only watched a couple episodes i've

593
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,120
read them from a manga though so

594
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,880
dude it's like beautifully done and all

595
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,479
well it's like a food battle show it's

596
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
like iron chef but with

597
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
with students who all go to a school and

598
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,120
they battle it out with each other

599
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,960
um and it is an incredible show

600
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,479
there's a really weird aspect to it

601
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,600
though which is like when somebody

602
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,240
eats food that's like really good

603
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,000
in in not in reality but like in their

604
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,200
mind or in the mind of the character

605
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,480
when they're eating it

606
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,559
they like will like essentially it

607
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,720
sounds like they're reaching orgasm

608
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,000
and their clothes like shred off and

609
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
they're still in like their underwear

610
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
or whatever but it's always something

611
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,200
absurd

612
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,640
like that or some absurd situation and

613
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,000
so you just can't watch it with like

614
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
other people around because they're like

615
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
what the hell are you watching you're

616
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,520
like i swear it's about cooking

617
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,840
um but i highly highly recommend food

618
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,840
wars

619
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,559
nice

620
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,360
all right who else has got stuff mean

621
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,320
this is the grifter

622
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
you you like

623
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,360
that so how do you

624
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,959
avoid burnout with all the things that

625
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,760
you do

626
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
um how do i avoid burnout with all the

627
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,799
things

628
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
i do because how do you just keep going

629
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,080
with it instead of just

630
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
walking away saying i'm done i need a

631
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,439
break

632
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
i i guess i i mean the real answer is

633
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
like i haven't

634
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,918
avoided that um there have been times

635
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,600
in in my career or in just my time

636
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
within the hacker community and some of

637
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,559
that where i'll like completely step

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,240
back

639
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,918
um from things and that can either be

640
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,320
because something else is going on in my

641
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,360
life

642
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,918
and that takes priority or

643
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,399
or because of just that like i get um

644
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,559
burnt out and so

645
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
it it is important to sometimes take a

646
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,918
step back and do something else the

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,159
unfortunate thing for me

648
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
is that beyond like you know watching

649
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
some anime or something like that like i

650
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,360
don't have

651
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:37,039
other hobbies like security has been my

652
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,479
hobby since i was a kid and so

653
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,919
for me this is what i love and

654
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,840
i would do this for free anyway um

655
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,520
but it just so happens that an industry

656
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
grew up around it and i'm lucky enough

657
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,360
to be part of that

658
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:56,320
um but i would say the best way to

659
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,918
avoid the burnout is to do i mean

660
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,399
exactly what we're doing right now which

661
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,799
is like spend time with other hackers

662
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,600
um the relationships and the other

663
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,280
people

664
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,959
that you interact with like i always um

665
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,399
i try to surround myself with people who

666
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,200
are smarter than me

667
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
um because then i feel like i still gain

668
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,039
that

669
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,840
um like i get that rush of like learning

670
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,440
something new

671
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,039
or when somebody talks about something

672
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
and you're like you're like wait what

673
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,840
and they explain

674
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
something and the light bulb goes on for

675
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,879
you for the 3000th time on

676
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
but just on something different i just

677
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,960
love that

678
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,959
and so it's kind of

679
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,480
i guess the people that that kind of

680
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,080
help you avoid it

681
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
but like i said there have been times

682
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
where i've gotten burnt out like i said

683
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
toward that you know after defcon 13 i

684
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
was ready to just like walk away from

685
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,678
gooning and then

686
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,120
um we did stop doing the defcon movie

687
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,640
channel just because then we were going

688
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,239
to a casino hotel and they weren't

689
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
really cool with us throwing a bunch of

690
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
like pirated movies all up on the

691
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
um the hotel channel for everybody in

692
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
the entire hotel to see

693
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,039
or hanging out in their switch closets

694
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,520
yes

695
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
they're not they were not fans of that

696
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,279
either

697
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,640
um and ziviyak was willing to take over

698
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,840
the scavenger hunt

699
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,799
right and then that that same year

700
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,439
we handed the scavenger hunt off um and

701
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,720
then

702
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,240
my my gooning gig was to like go to all

703
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,279
the parties you know so

704
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,520
it's like i i dialed some things back or

705
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,120
stepped away from a few things

706
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,480
um i was really heavy into

707
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,158
you know 2600 slc and and dc801

708
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,559
and running all the meetings and chasing

709
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,640
people down to do talks at every meeting

710
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,158
and updating the website and taking

711
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
pictures of everybody and doing all

712
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
whatever

713
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,760
from 2000 to like 2007.

714
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,360
and then 2007 my first kid was born

715
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,799
and i was like i just i can't i can't do

716
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,918
all of this stuff and then also

717
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,879
like be a dad like one i'm just tired

718
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,720
all the time

719
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
and anybody who's a parent or a new

720
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
parent knows exactly what i'm talking

721
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,399
about

722
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,640
um but it was you know like uh

723
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
essentially like a passing of the torch

724
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,039
um for

725
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,158
a little bit um it just

726
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,679
died um the i was like i can't support

727
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,320
doing the meetings all

728
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,279
trying to organize everything by myself

729
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,320
and

730
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,400
it took until i met metacortex where we

731
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,600
worked together at juniper

732
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,520
um and he was like oh man

733
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,719
like i would love to take over the dc

734
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,279
801 meetings

735
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
and i was like that would be amazing and

736
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,960
i transferred him the domain

737
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
and started you know attending the

738
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,880
meetings but not having to run

739
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,480
everything and so sometimes you just

740
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
have to pass the torch you know and then

741
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,400
eventually like you know

742
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,240
he passed the torch as well and like it

743
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,159
has continued on and so um

744
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
yeah i don't know i guess you just start

745
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
to step away from stuff

746
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,918
as you need to and you can always step

747
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,760
back in and even like the hacker space

748
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,039
like i was very involved in the hacker

749
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,158
space for years

750
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,000
um but in the last two years i

751
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
haven't been at all and that's mostly

752
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
just because i've been super busy with

753
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
work

754
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,039
and now obviously the quarantine but one

755
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,159
thing the quarantine made me realize

756
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,760
is that i super super miss um the hacker

757
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
space and so i'm like well as soon as we

758
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
can

759
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,320
go back safely and spend time together

760
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
and stuff that i'm like oh i need to get

761
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,720
back there

762
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
because it is one of my happy places

763
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,520
cool

764
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,439
all right then i'll ask another question

765
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,000
since it's been slow on on some of these

766
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,520
questions

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,840
but can i ask a question uh no yeah

768
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,559
of course go uh you can go first if you

769
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,918
need

770
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,440
no no no no mr fame mr the famous alex

771
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
go right ahead yeah that's a stupid

772
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,159
youtube handle um anyway

773
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,158
uh i just wanted to know what uh

774
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,760
advice you would have for somebody who

775
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,919
is i would say

776
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,600
mostly a script kitty like very very

777
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,240
beginning script kitty

778
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,678
uh as far as getting into the cyber

779
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,919
security

780
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,960
space uh just any advice you would give

781
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,640
um i think i don't know like that my

782
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,919
advice there is just to like dive in

783
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,679
i think um there's a lot

784
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,960
it's a lot different from i think when

785
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,960
when some of us who were

786
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,159
in in this um you know chat started out

787
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,799
um we were much more generalists like we

788
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,720
had to

789
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,320
know a lot of different things you had

790
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
to know all of the you know every

791
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,600
operating system and how they all work

792
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,039
together you had to know everything

793
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,959
about networking and every different

794
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
protocol and all the different whatever

795
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,080
and then you know it was like oh now

796
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,639
there's wi-fi so you have to learn about

797
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,639
that too

798
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,799
and also hold on to that and then you

799
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,640
know be an expert in all the things

800
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,918
and and now the industry's so large and

801
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,559
there's so many different technologies

802
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,840
and stuff that

803
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,360
that you can focus on something right um

804
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,120
you know like obviously like like luke

805
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,240
became wi-fi luke you know like i know

806
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,439
lucas a

807
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,559
um the letter a um but

808
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
uh you know it was like that when when

809
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,240
wi-fi

810
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,639
came out and it was a huge pain in the

811
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,320
ass

812
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,000
for a lot of us because we're like wait

813
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,678
a minute we're gonna do what like we've

814
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
spent all this time trying to secure our

815
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,399
networks and now we're going to

816
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,440
broadcast them

817
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,840
outside of our walls this is insane like

818
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
we're setting security back 10 years

819
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,279
um but then you have people like you

820
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
know like luke or like dark matter or

821
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,039
whatever that just

822
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,799
see this one particular technology and

823
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,520
they're like i'm just going to

824
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,720
attack that thing um because what for

825
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,080
whatever reason

826
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,000
it resonates with them and they're

827
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
excited about it and so

828
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,520
um i would say just try a bunch of

829
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,080
different things like and figure out

830
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
what your

831
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,760
niche is like what's the thing that you

832
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,799
want to be um

833
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,279
for me at least

834
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,639
you know more recently as things have

835
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,640
like splintered off and stuff like

836
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,960
threat hunting is my thing like i really

837
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,799
really enjoy going into environments

838
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,880
trying to you know figure out my way

839
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,279
around and then looking for

840
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,559
uh you know the evidence of attackers

841
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,000
you know persisting within the

842
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,120
environment that we didn't know were

843
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,120
already there

844
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,000
um it lends to my skill set pretty well

845
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,158
just because i

846
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,520
am somebody who grew up doing this and

847
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,880
is really like a

848
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,279
a like a broad range of topics um

849
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,120
i have some knowledge of a broad range

850
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,520
of topics right like an inch deep

851
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,639
mile wide um which is perfect for threat

852
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,960
hunting because

853
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
um you know you need to understand how

854
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,760
protocols work and find

855
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,360
anomalies and things like that so

856
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
um just start messing around with stuff

857
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,918
like go if you're you know

858
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,440
into um you know reverse engineering

859
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,399
stuff then it's like okay maybe spend a

860
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
little time doing that

861
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,439
if you're focused on a different

862
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,520
technology then

863
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
uh you know spend time working with you

864
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,918
know wi-fi and see what you think of it

865
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
or

866
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
um if you're into physical you know pen

867
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
testing then

868
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
you know pick some locks and clone some

869
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,918
you know

870
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,520
rfid stuff or nfc stuff like find out

871
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,080
what's the thing that makes you actually

872
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,918
get excited and then just read

873
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,720
everything that you can possibly read

874
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,080
about it

875
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,360
and one thing that's nice is that now

876
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
there's enough um online war game style

877
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
things where you can just get on and

878
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,159
start

879
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,158
you know throwing attacks at different

880
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,919
systems that are set up specifically for

881
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,039
that or you can fire up your own virtual

882
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,320
environment and do it

883
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,399
where um when i was

884
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,320
starting out it was literally like your

885
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,639
only choice was really like oh i wanna

886
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
you

887
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,000
learn some munich stuff i have to break

888
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,799
and do it university

889
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and so that's what we did um yeah just

890
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,760
find the thing

891
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,960
try a little bit of everything and then

892
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
when you find the thing that makes you

893
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,480
genuinely excited

894
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,000
just dive head first into it and learn

895
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,840
everything that you possibly can and

896
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,480
then

897
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:57,439
become that guy for your

898
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,440
group of friends or or co-workers

899
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:09,200
nice i really like that thank you

900
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,199
all right somebody else got a question

901
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,960
it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to

902
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,200
be computer related too you guys can ask

903
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
me like random crap i don't care

904
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,399
yeah well i'll keep spurring the

905
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,399
discussion for a little bit

906
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,840
the question that i was going to ask a

907
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,678
few minutes ago was

908
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,760
almost every single one of us as either

909
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,960
an i.t or a security person

910
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,080
has that at least one of those

911
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,760
aha moments you know where like we we

912
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,760
discovered something that totally blew

913
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,120
our minds and we went down the rabbit

914
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
hole of doom

915
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,399
uh as it were to to like figure all this

916
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,559
stuff out just like you were talking

917
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,239
about and it'd be cool to hear like what

918
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,360
are some of the things that

919
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,120
that really got you excited or or or

920
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,519
tipped that scale for you and

921
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,959
led you down those kind of rabbit holes

922
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,320
um sure i mean like

923
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,600
i guess one of the things for me was um

924
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,519
like what actually brought me to more of

925
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,678
a defensive side of the house

926
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,440
like not um like i was i was much more

927
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
offensive focused i liked breaking stuff

928
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,200
i like breaking into things

929
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,559
um and then i was working with

930
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,960
um with deadhead actually at the time

931
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,678
and uh and we were doing consulting for

932
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,440
a company

933
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,080
that had experienced a breach um

934
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
that wasn't what we normally handled but

935
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
they had heard

936
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
word of mouth from another customer or

937
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
client of ours that um

938
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,240
that we might be able to help them and

939
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
so they were like hey can you come in

940
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,640
here and like help us clean this mess up

941
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
essentially

942
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,320
figure out how this attacker got in and

943
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,679
all this and this is probably

944
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,039
man i want to say like 2002 or something

945
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,080
like that i don't know

946
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,360
um so a while ago

947
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,960
and um and we went in and we sat down

948
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,479
and we just started like

949
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
carving through things right we were

950
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,320
looking at logs we're

951
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
trying to figure out like what systems

952
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,120
had been accessed where

953
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,199
additional accounts had showed up that

954
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,039
hadn't been there before or where

955
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,960
accounts had privilege escalation and

956
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,080
different things and going and piecing

957
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,159
together

958
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,760
what this attacker had done within the

959
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,200
environment and we ended up spending

960
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,158
quite a bit of time there our first

961
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
night there

962
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,279
we literally we came in at um

963
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,880
we came in at 9 00 a.m like when the

964
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,519
when the place opened

965
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,720
and we left i think at like 10 30 the

966
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,279
next morning

967
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,919
to go get some sleep um and then came

968
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,159
back so we

969
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,080
pulled like a full 24 hours like just

970
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,519
doing this investigation

971
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,439
and in the end we were able to like

972
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,600
trace it back to what looked like the

973
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,399
attacker was coming from somewhere in

974
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,080
in italy in the area of rome and like we

975
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,239
saw all the places that they went to

976
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,600
and we um you know had to go out and buy

977
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
some additional like

978
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,439
equipment for them and you know they

979
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,120
didn't have the best firewalls and

980
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,120
whatever and so we

981
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,639
went and sourced some stuff and got it

982
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,709
all configured and set up

983
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,039
but um man it was so much fun

984
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,079
[Laughter]

985
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,199
and so i was like holy crap

986
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,200
like this is really really fun like i

987
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,879
really enjoyed that and i was like maybe

988
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,480
we should do this every once in a while

989
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
instead of just always breaking stuff

990
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,520
we'll um

991
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,879
we'll try to to become the investigator

992
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,040
right because this would have felt like

993
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,000
like i'm a big sherlock holmes fan and i

994
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,599
was like ooh we're

995
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,199
we're getting we're being like sherlock

996
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,639
holmes we're going in and trying to

997
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,799
piece together clues and figure out

998
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,919
what's going on and that was

999
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,280
really exciting like we um we had a lot

1000
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,799
of fun and so

1001
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,960
um you know it became

1002
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,159
part of uh you know a part of my

1003
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,679
my psyche that i didn't realize um

1004
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,240
i really wanted to to explore and so

1005
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,720
you know that was that was my first real

1006
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,118
investigation and it made me

1007
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,319
really excited about it i mean we still

1008
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,440
um didn't do a lot of like ir

1009
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,200
type of things and um but and and

1010
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
most of my career continued to be

1011
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,919
offensive related

1012
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,119
and until only i don't know eight years

1013
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,440
ago or so

1014
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,599
um but but that was a big like oh

1015
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,119
the blue team side of this is actually

1016
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,640
super fun

1017
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:31,839
um so yeah that was big for me

1018
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,839
awesome cool who else has got questions

1019
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,320
nobody trevor

1020
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,880
trevor oh little buddy

1021
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,960
so you're you're you're talking about

1022
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,040
the blue team stuff a lot

1023
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320
and uh you know i i worked on a red team

1024
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
and loved it that was the time of my

1025
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,800
life

1026
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,598
uh and like you have switched over to

1027
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,720
blue team and i have a really hard time

1028
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,320
finding venues where i can share what

1029
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,680
i've learned what i've discovered

1030
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
what kind of tips would you have for

1031
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,399
people who are on blue teams trying to

1032
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,040
get the word out

1033
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,000
and you know show what we're doing on

1034
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,119
our end of it not just the red team side

1035
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,240
yeah i think um i think it's a in some

1036
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,359
some cases it's about um approach like

1037
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,200
the way that you approach it because i

1038
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,160
noticed the same thing right everybody

1039
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,960
wants to hear about the crazy sexy hack

1040
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,680
that like requires you to you know take

1041
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,440
a server

1042
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
and dip it in liquid nitrogen while

1043
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,599
you're on a boat that's moving along the

1044
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,400
equator

1045
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,200
in september right like those types of

1046
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,680
attacks are

1047
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,799
are really like cool to read about to

1048
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
hear about to

1049
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,760
watch on somebody demo that kind of

1050
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,160
thing um but there's some really elegant

1051
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,280
defense solutions as well and so what um

1052
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,440
what i find will will often get folks to

1053
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,320
um to pay attention to the defensive

1054
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,920
side

1055
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,320
is to lay out the offensive attack that

1056
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,000
you are defending against it is it is a

1057
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,480
great hook it's always a great hook

1058
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,800
it's the same thing as like you don't

1059
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,960
watch a heist movie from the perspective

1060
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,640
of the cops usually right you watch it

1061
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,119
from the folks who are conducting the

1062
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
heist

1063
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,880
because that's the more interesting

1064
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,880
thing to watch um and so you just kind

1065
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,440
of have to frame it in the same way when

1066
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,280
you're discussing like a new defense or

1067
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,160
a new like for me like hunting technique

1068
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,920
or whatever

1069
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,520
i'll say like here's what attackers are

1070
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,200
doing here's how they're

1071
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,280
you know approaching these types of

1072
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,359
systems they'll use this type of attack

1073
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
and this is how we can detect that type

1074
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
of thing so they think they're being

1075
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,280
slick they're doing this

1076
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,359
that um or something else and um

1077
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
and this is our approach to defend

1078
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,640
against that so they're getting smarter

1079
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,440
so we have to get smarter

1080
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,480
and that is um you know like i said it's

1081
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,720
usually best framed with like laying out

1082
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,320
what the um what it exactly it is that

1083
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,279
you're defending against and why it

1084
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,640
matters

1085
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,400
um i think venues like

1086
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,118
um like black hat has gotten better

1087
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,720
about um adding more defensive stuff to

1088
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,000
it as well as defcon

1089
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,680
with things like the blue team village

1090
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,280
and whatever now i personally my

1091
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,640
personal belief with with both blackout

1092
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,720
and defcon is they are

1093
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,560
they always have been offensive focused

1094
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,759
and so they are primarily

1095
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,720
going to be offense focused or red team

1096
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,760
focused

1097
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,879
um and that's okay but um

1098
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,800
but yeah i think it's just creating a

1099
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
you know a defensive talk that makes

1100
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,839
people want to listen to it

1101
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,839
um or a blog or whatever it is

1102
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,000
anything else

1103
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:55,200
what what are you wearing

1104
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,520
what am i wearing um i will i will

1105
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,839
give anybody else you get one guest to

1106
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,839
guess what i'm wearing right now

1107
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,640
black v-neck black hat jeans

1108
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,880
boots okay so

1109
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,640
um black crew neck so yes a black

1110
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,960
t-shirt but it's a crew neck

1111
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,040
um so he has a black t-shirt with

1112
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,240
nothing on it just a plain black t-shirt

1113
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,920
jeans a black hat

1114
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,040
no boots because i'm in my house and i

1115
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,119
take my shoes off when i come inside

1116
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,240
there's legends that grifter roams

1117
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,240
defcon wearing

1118
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,000
shorts a white t-shirt and a white hat

1119
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
just to not be noticed

1120
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,520
i did that once i did that once at an

1121
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,279
rsa um

1122
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:44,240
event that was a company event

1123
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,680
i was talking to what was he was like

1124
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,118
ah man i can't remember what his

1125
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,399
position was somebody pretty high up in

1126
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,960
the organization

1127
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,800
and they were like oh yeah you know um

1128
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,119
whenever i see grifter he's always

1129
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
wearing this and the event was in

1130
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,000
orlando

1131
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,359
and another thing that um i think many

1132
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,560
of you probably know at this point is

1133
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,598
that like i love

1134
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,640
disney stuff like i am like a

1135
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,359
um i'm like a utah housewife

1136
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,279
in in the amount that i love disney and

1137
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
so i go to disney parks whenever i get

1138
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,000
the chance i have an annual pass to

1139
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,919
disneyland

1140
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,319
i've been to all the parks in the world

1141
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,400
um so if events happen in orlando you

1142
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,279
know i'm going there but when i go

1143
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,720
especially if it's august and i'm in

1144
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,040
florida

1145
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,078
i wear white like i have a white hat and

1146
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,160
a white t-shirt

1147
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,319
and i i don't wear shorts i never wear

1148
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,799
shorts so i'm still in jeans but i had a

1149
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,200
white

1150
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,480
shirt and a white hat so um

1151
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,960
i think what they don't appreciate is

1152
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,160
that you go by yourself

1153
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,280
oh yeah i totally do buy in early to go

1154
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,680
to

1155
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,119
everything yeah i don't care i don't

1156
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,759
care if i look creepy

1157
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,599
i don't care it's i i enjoy it like

1158
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,960
that's another thing like you know

1159
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,800
i just don't care what people think

1160
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,880
about you it makes life a lot easier

1161
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,720
i can't i'm not super super good at that

1162
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,400
sometimes i still get my feelings hurt

1163
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,040
or whatever or i'm like oh that guy was

1169
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,520
normally right um but uh and so i've

1170
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,520
just gotten used to being alone and

1171
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,960
going to museums alone or doing other

1172
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,680
stuff by myself

1173
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,200
so yeah i just go by myself but this one

1174
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,640
particular guy was like oh you're always

1175
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,240
in always wearing black always wearing

1176
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,078
black and i'm like yeah well

1177
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,160
whenever i present i wear a black

1178
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,960
button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled

1179
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,680
and i wear jeans and that's how i roll

1180
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,599
you know

1181
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,520
i said now it's kind of become like a

1182
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,119
branding thing i'm like people just

1183
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,119
recognize me

1184
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,240
in that and so if i wear something else

1185
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,640
then they'll be like where

1186
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,078
why that guy looks familiar where do i

1187
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,920
know that guy from but if i was wearing

1188
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,440
my normal stuff they'd be like grifter

1189
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,440
right so

1190
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520

1191
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,960

so i went up in this like circle of

1200
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,240
folks who were talking and i just stood

1201

for quite a while

1205
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,400

downstairs we rented a big cabin up and

1239
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,040
up in a canyon somewhere so we could be

1240
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
as

1241
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,560
distance from the rest of the world as

1242
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,920
we could um and i came

1243
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,319
downstairs in a white shirt you know

1244
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,640
like a white t-shirt and the white hat

1245

1248
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,759
burning truck and i was

1249
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,279
covered in blood and the shirt is

1250
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,800
covered in blood and they just thought

1251
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
that that was like the funniest thing

1252
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,319
ever

1253
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,520
that like the day that grifter wears a

1254
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,560
white shirt

1255
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,920
he ends up covered in in you know

1256
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:16,960
soot and blood and other whatever

1257
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,960
um yeah it was it was insane

1258
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,280
i should have too stumper cut himself up

1259
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,040
when he dove into the cab to get that to

1260
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
like start dragging that guy out

1261
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,040
he went across like a seat covered in

1262
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,960
glass so his hands were all cut up from

1263
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,240
the glass and everything like

1264
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,000
and the fire was so hot um

1265
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,759
but he just like went straight into it

1266
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,760
and i'm like leaning in and i'm like

1267
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,839
squinting my face it feels like it's

1268
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,359
freaking already on fire i was like holy

1269
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,520
crap this is hot

1270
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,119
um and he's like oh i didn't even feel

1271
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,480
it i just like went for it

1272
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,720
i was like damn dude i was like ow ow

1273
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,720
ow

1274
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,040
yeah situation like that you must not

1275
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,078
think much

1276
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,560
about yourself as much as

1277
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,319
getting someone else out of trouble yeah

1278
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,839
i guess that just makes me more selfish

1279
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,079
or something because i definitely felt

1280
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,240
the heat man

1281
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,920
i was like oh my gosh this is so hot i

1282
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
mean i still leaned into the thing and

1283
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,680
grabbed the guy out of it but i

1284
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,640
definitely knew like you are sticking

1285
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,000
your head

1286
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,359
into a bunch of smoke and it feels like

1287
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,160
you're already on fire

1288
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,640
like i was like man this is hot but that

1289
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,560
dude

1290
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,160
was he already had flames rolling up his

1291
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,960
back and he was getting burnt up so it

1292
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,078
was

1293
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,839
it was a bad situation but um

1294
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,599
but yeah i guess stumper is just more

1295
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,520
selfless or or

1296
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,720
less self-involved than i am that he was

1297
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,800
just like oh

1298
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,240
i didn't even pay attention to how much

1299
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,640

1358
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,040
um china is a really cool country it's

1359
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,960
like one of those things where

1360
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,960
um you don't have to agree with what

1361
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,760
their government is doing

1362
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,480
to still have an appreciation for one

1363
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,839
the

1364
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,680
the culture and our differences and

1365
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,680
stuff like that but also

1366
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,480
the people are just absolutely

1367
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,240
incredible so you can have all of the

1368
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,480
disagreements you want to have about the

1369
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,839
way that that china runs its country or

1370
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,920
interacts with other countries in the

1371
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,119
world or with their own people

1372
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,000
and still appreciate the people that you

1373
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,119
do get to go

1374
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,800
and interact with and i got some

1375
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,079
flack honestly from some people who are

1376
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,839
like oh i can't believe you're going to

1377
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,680
go to china

1378
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,520
and do defcon china you know you should

1379
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,680
boycott it because it's china and china

1380
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,440
sucks and in my opinion if you disagree

1381
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,359
with a country in the way that they do

1382
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,359
things um

1383
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,279
probably the best people that you want

1384
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,000
to associate yourself with is their

1385
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,240
hackers

1386
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,079
because if um something hits the fan um

1387
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,200
it's really hackers who are gonna be the

1388
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,400
ones who

1389
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,520
one can either hack together um

1390
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,640
you know communication and um

1391
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,240
secure communication at that and and

1392
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:08,240
make the changes that are necessary to

1393
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,319
to uh i don't know i don't want to say

1394
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,040
overthrow it's a strong word but um

1395
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,319
to fight against an oppressive regime

1396
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,640
and so

1397
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,119
if you ask me to go to any country and

1398
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,640
to sit side by side with their hackers

1399
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,440
and talk to them about

1400
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,960
um you know the best techniques and best

1401
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,720
ways to defend yourself and

1402
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,800
that kind of stuff i'll do it every

1403
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,839
single time

1404
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,839
yeah sure

1405
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,160

1437
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,520

1441
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,960

oh no and then i don't know if lean um

1445
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,240
i mentioned it to you guys but like his

1446
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,520
first post was a picture of me sleeping

1447
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,520
on a couch

1448
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,960
and there was so much interaction with

1449
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,599
the first post the account

1450
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,880
ever posted that it got flagged by

1451
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,119
twitter as like

1452
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,000
potentially something bad which i think

1453
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,760
is pretty funny

1454
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,440
but that just spurred lean on because

1455
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
then he was like clearly the demand for

1456
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,280
this is great

1457
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,880
we must continue i'm like whatever dude

1458
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,079
you'll get bored of it in a week i'm not

1459
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,880
i'm not scared

1460
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,240
nobody got bored of it yet well don't dm

1461
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,800
him pictures because then he'll run out

1462
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,799
of content

1463
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,200
on a serious note i was wondering if he

1464
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,960
had any books podcasts any

1465
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,839
anything like that that that you would

1466
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,880
recommend security wise

1467
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,558
um let's see

1468
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,920
you know this is gonna you know most

1469
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,520
people are gonna recommend the same kind

1470
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,640
of books the same podcast you know

1471
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,920
things like you know the

1472
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,960

1474

1476

people

1478

um and it's about reading body language

1489
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,720
and so like understanding when people

1490
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,558
are lying and what the cues are when

1491
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,240
they start to lie or when you can tell

1492
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,119
when somebody's uncomfortable

1493
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,399
or um if they're like excited about

1494
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,800
something but they're holding things

1495
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,760
back

1496
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,480
and like reading those like small cues

1497
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,200
and that

1498
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,280
has been useful in one in just like

1499
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,960
average everyday interactions like you

1500
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,880
can tell when somebody's lying to you

1501
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,640
and now like knowing the techniques that

1502
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,359
are in the book like i'm like holy hell

1503
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,558
like things stand out like a sore thumb

1504
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,160
there are people that i meet and i'll

1505
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,960
have like a conversation with them about

1506
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,200
something

1507
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,559
and i'm like this person is a case study

1508
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,799
for what

1509
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,760
it looks like when someone lies like all

1510
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,280
of the different

1511
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,800
shifts like the way they shift their

1512
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,480
eyes or the way that they look off to

1513
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,400
the side or the way that they move their

1514
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,599
arms and that kind of stuff so

1515
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,400
um yeah what everybody is saying is good

1516
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,319
um

1517
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,680
and then i always recommend this book

1518
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,279
and i'm just gonna keep recommending it

1519
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,200
forever but if you haven't read

1520
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,240
exploding the phone

1521
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,160
um exploding the phone is more

1522
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:31,118
um it's like a history of phone freaking

1523
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,799
and so um that's really where a lot of

1524
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,079
like the hacker culture comes from and

1525
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,680
where it started out

1526
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,920
was people were messing around with

1527
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,680
phone systems and then it eventually

1528
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,599
moved to computers once we started to

1529
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,440
hook computers up to the phones but

1530
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,160
exploding the phone goes from like the

1531
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,160
creation of the first telephone systems

1532
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,480
like all the way through like modern day

1533
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,200
like freaking and it's an incredibly

1534
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,559
good book

1535
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,759
and so i highly recommend that one um

1536
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,640
but yeah i think um

1537
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,319
you know there's a couple of good um you

1538
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,000
know streams that you could follow on

1539
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,558
like twitch and stuff too where

1540
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,160
because everybody's quarantined uh you

1541
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,160
know folks like rando

1542
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,078
