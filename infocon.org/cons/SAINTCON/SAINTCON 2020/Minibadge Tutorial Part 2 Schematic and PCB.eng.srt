1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,880
all right so

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,880
i'm going to open up kai cad here

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
so the first thing you'll want to do is

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,040
create a new project it's this first

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,720
button on the top left here

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,198
pick a place where you want to save it

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,560
uh i created this folder inside

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,800
my documents folder so i'm going to call

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,799
this

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,279
my mini badge and click save

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
and it will create its own folder for

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,519
inside wherever you picked

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,280
and create a schematic and a pcb file

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840
so the first thing we're going to do is

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,879
click right here on schematic layout

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,079
editor

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,079
the schematic is where you

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
design how you want your circuit

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,559
connected

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
so first thing we need to do is grab

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
those libraries that we

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
downloaded so click up on the top on

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,679
preferences

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
and manage symbol libraries

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
now there are two types of libraries you

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
can have you can have global libraries

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
that will be there for any project you

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
ever create and then there are project

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,679
specific libraries

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
go ahead and click there if you click

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,840
this little folder icon

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,119
it'll ask you to pick an existing

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,840
mini badge library so let me go ahead

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,840
and grab that

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,240
so this is the downloaded

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
library from github you notice there are

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
two folders in there one

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,000
for eagle and one for kycad we want the

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
kycad libraries

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,479
double click in there and then here

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
the saintcondeskminibadge.lib is

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
the library we want here for the

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
schematic the other one the dot pretty

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,280
folder is for

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,799
the circuit board so select that

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,520
click open that's there now

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
click ok and now we're ready to start

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,359
putting parts

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680
in our schematic so

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
over here on the top right this button

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
with a little triangle

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
looking symbol is called place symbol

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
click that

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
and then click anywhere in your

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,840
schematic

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
and it's going to load up all the

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,800
libraries that it knows about

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
and give us a list

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,319
so first thing we're going to do is

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,120
search for

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:40,079
our mini badge library so

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
type in many still a lot of things mini

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
badge there we go

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,958
so this is the default library that luke

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,840
jenkins created

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,519
the simple version has only eight pins

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
the minimum required to make a mini

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,440
badge here

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,000
so select that click ok and we'll set

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,120
that right there in the middle

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
now if we zoom in on this you can see

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,560
these are the eight pins just in the

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
corners

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
i don't have any of the middle pins here

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,480
this is laid out kind of physically like

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,359
a mini badges so

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
let's click again we've still got the

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
place sybil

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
tool selected here so we click again

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
and this time we're going to place an

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,959
led

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,119
and this plane led right here is what we

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,159
want

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
click ok and now we can place this in

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
here

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
now this may be

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
not exactly the way we want it and we

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
can kind of drag it up here

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,120
so what we're going to do is we're going

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,159
to connect an led and a resistor to pin

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,120
seven and eight here so

92
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,399
with an led yeah i'm going to click to

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,439
place this here

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,560
there's an orientation here and so

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,159
the arrow on an led line points towards

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
the negative side

97
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
and so we want that connected to ground

98
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,159
over here

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
whereas our positive 3.3 volts on pin 7

100
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,798
is over here so this is kind of

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
backwards

102
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,478
so there's multiple ways we can go about

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
this the easiest one

104
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,639
is to put your mouse over the component

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,960
and press r for rotate

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
and that's going to rotate at 90 degrees

107
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
if i push it again

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
now we're at 180 and that's the

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,359
direction we want it

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,840
okay still got my place tool selected so

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,040
i'm going to add a resistor now

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,690
so click again and now we're going to

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,840
search for

114
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,840
[Music]

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,119
resistor

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,119
in here we're going to have to scroll

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
down a little bit

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
lots of different types of fancy

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
resistors and everything

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,720
the one r is for resistor this is

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
a more generic symbol i prefer the r

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,240
underscore us

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,840
symbol which is more the zag zigzag line

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,120
or the traditional resistor symbol

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,239
so click ok and now we've got a resistor

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,520
here

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,039
and i'm going to place it just like that

128
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,639
okay so

129
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
throughout these tutorials you're going

130
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
to see me i use a lot of keyboard

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,159
shortcuts

132
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,560
it makes this quicker and easier

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
but it doesn't show up on screen as well

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
so

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,919
i've got this little thing that pops up

136
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
the keys that i'm pressing there

137
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,359
hopefully that helps a lot i'll try to

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,199
say what i'm pressing when i do it

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
so anytime you press escape it's going

140
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
to go back to your

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,240
normal select tool get rid of whatever

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,240
thing you were on

143
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,599
so the next thing we're going to do is

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
wire this up

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,680
so over here is the place wire button

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,440
you can also just press w

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,520
to do this so if i select that

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,400
and click on the end of this led here

149
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,520
now i'm dragging a wire

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,758
over to where i want it so in this case

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,400
i want to drag it down to pin 7 here

152
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,039
and you'll notice that once i click

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
there

154
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,039
this wire is connected and there's no

155
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,599
longer this little red circle around the

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
end

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
so you know that it's actually connected

158
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
there

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,479
so now we've got the anode the

160
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
positive side of the led connected to

161
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
our 3.3 volts here

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,680
we're going to take the other side of it

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,600
and connect it over to this resistor

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,880
and then this side we're going to

165
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
connect back to pin 8

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
and hit escape to get out of the wire

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
tool

168
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
and we've created a circuit here it's

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
very simple

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
led and a resistor but that's really all

171
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
we need

172
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:05,280
let's save here so i don't lose anything

173
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
all right so now that we've got our

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,239
circuit here

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,240
we're ready to move on to the next step

176
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,719
so up here starting with this little

177
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,599
paper and pen

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
icon here this is the the next set of

179
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
things we're going to do

180
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,479
so this one is called annotate schematic

181
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
symbols

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
and what that's going to do is all these

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,799
uh

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,119
components here don't have numbers yet

185
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
so this all the question marks are going

186
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
to change into numbers

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,039
so when we click this you don't really

188
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,440
need to worry about all these options

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,479
here

190
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
just click annotate and it's going to go

191
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
through

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
the schematic sheet systematically and

193
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,080
number

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
all these things starting top left

195
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,240
bottom right and it'll

196
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,638
automatically number everything in our

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,680
case we've only got one diode here

198
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,840
so d1 one resistor is r1

199
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
and one mini badge here is x1

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
so we've got that done the next thing

201
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,159
we're going to do

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,560
is this one is called assign pcb

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,639
footprints to schematic symbols

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
so this is where we're going to tell

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
kicad

206
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,919
what actual parts we want to put on our

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
board for each of these components

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,840
so we click that it's going to load up

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,840
all the footprints

210
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,839
alright now that we've got those loaded

211
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,080
here in the middle is the components

212
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
from our board

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
and then on the left are the libraries

214
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
that are available to us

215
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,519
and on the right are the footprints in

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
the selected library

217
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,080
so the first thing we need to do is add

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,719
the one that we downloaded before

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,760
we go to preferences here at the top

220
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,000
manage footprint libraries

221
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,439
same type of deal as the libraries

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
before for the schematic

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
right you have global and project

224
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,040
specific

225
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,080
we're going to go into project specific

226
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,279
click the folder

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,800
to add an existing library

228
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,760
and we are going to

229
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,160
select the one that we downloaded

230
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
earlier

231
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
okay so i've got that selected

232
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,320
this is our mini badge underscore

233
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,319
cad library click ok

234
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
and now that library is in here

235
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,199
mini badge icad and now here again we've

236
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
got the normal mini badge designed by

237
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
luke jenkins

238
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,920
and then the simple version so right

239
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,040
here in the middle

240
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,079
in the select x1 our sync on mini badge

241
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,719
and then over here double click on

242
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,120
the footprint we want and it's going to

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,560
apply it there

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,360
now for our led on the left

245
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,479
there's a library called led underscore

246
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,279
smd

247
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,040
smd stands for surface mount now the

248
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,079
leds that are in your badge pack are

249
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,199
surface mount leds

250
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,000
so we've got d1 selected here and then

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
on the right

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,279
we're going to come over here and we're

253
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,519
going to choose

254
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,399
led 1206

255
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
now 1206 is the size of led that's in

256
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,600
your badge pack

257
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,479
and the the 12 1206

258
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,480
it's the

259
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,560
it's in it's not metric the 3216 is what

260
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,079
it is in metric

261
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,518
that's 3.2 by 1.6 millimeters

262
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,279
this one's in inches this is 0.12 inches

263
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,120
by .06 inches

264
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,480
to make this easier since we're going to

265
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,959
be assembling

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
these mini badges by hand there's one

267
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,959
down here

268
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
called hand solder so what that is is

269
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,040
basically the pads are just a little bit

270
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
bigger

271
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
and they extend a little bit further

272
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,640
past the led to make it easier to solder

273
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,800
it by hand

274
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
but if you're having a machine solder

275
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,439
these selecting this one wouldn't be

276
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
good

277
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,959
there's too much solder paste and it

278
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,959
tends to cause problems for assembly

279
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,279
in our case we want this it's going to

280
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,439
make it easier for us to

281
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
do it by hand so double click that it

282
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
assigns it here

283
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,119
moves to the next part and this is our

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
resistor

285
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
so over here on the left we're going to

286
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
go to

287
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,519
resistor underscore smd and

288
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,560
same thing down here 1206 but we want

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,560
the hand solder one

290
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
and it looks like there are two of them

291
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
select the bigger one

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
again make it a little bit easier on us

293
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
so

294
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
double click that and now all three of

295
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,320
our components have

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,160
footprints assigned so we're ready to go

297
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,760
click apply save schematic and continue

298
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
that'll save it click ok

299
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,959
so now we've given our parts numbers

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,440
we've assigned them footprints

301
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,839
now click this generate netlist button

302
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
and click generate netlist and what this

303
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,120
is going to do

304
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,680
is create the file that the

305
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
actual circuit board side of this needs

306
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,239
to know how everything is connected

307
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
so leave it where it's at it's

308
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
automatically going to put it next to

309
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,639
your other files

310
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,920
click save and now we're ready

311
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,880
to actually make a circuit board

312
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,319
so up here it's one was kind of looks

313
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,639
like a circuit board

314
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
click that and this is going to open

315
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,720
circuit board program so

316
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,480
first thing we're going to do here is uh

317
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,880
click update pcb from schematic

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,079
and this is going to grab everything

319
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
that's in the schematic

320
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,160
and pull it in here along with

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,959
footprints everything's green here

322
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,719
zero errors so click update pcb

323
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,160
and click close so now

324
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
it's wanting us to put these parts

325
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,199
somewhere so

326
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,000
go ahead and click and now see

327
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,719
everything looks a little

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
bit highlighted here so everything right

329
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
now is

330
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,680
selected so if we hit escape and

331
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,560
deselect everything

332
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
now if we zoom in you can see this is

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,239
our

334
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,760
mini badge outline along with the

335
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,800
holes for the pins then we've got our d1

336
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,160
and r1 here

337
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
our led and our resistor

338
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,399
now what we're going to do

339
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
on save this and then

340
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,680
now we're going to move on to our

341
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,439
artwork because

342
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
doing our artwork first makes placing

343
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
these a little bit easier and then we

344
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,880
don't have to move them again later

345
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:49,519
so now we're going to move to

346
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,519
inkscape and do our artwork there

347
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
all right so we're going to open

348
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
inkscape

349
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079
and the first thing we need to do is

350
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,680
install that svg

351
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,839
to shenzhen plugin so

352
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,800
on that website there's a nice

353
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,079
on how to install it step by step and

354
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,680
i'm going to take you through that right

355
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,160
now

356
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,199
so in escape the first thing we're going

357
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,360
to do

358
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,680
is click on

359
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,320
edit go down to the bottom and select

360
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,319
preferences

361
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,758
and over here select system

362
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,959
and the thing we're looking for is

363
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,839
user extensions so if you click this

364
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,439
nice little open button here it's going

365
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,480
to open

366
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,399
right to the extensions folder now i've

367
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,920
already got this

368
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,000
clicking installed i'll go ahead and

369
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,719
delete this and show you guys exactly

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,720
how this works

371
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
all right so here i've got the the

372
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,079
extension

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,839
that we downloaded from github unzip it

374
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,599
and then you're gonna select everything

375
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
in here

376
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,279
copy it and then we're gonna paste it

377
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,399
right into this extensions folder

378
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,519
paste that in there and that's it

379
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,880
it's installed so you can close these

380
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,040
close this and then we'll need to

381
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
restart inkscape to finish that

382
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,839
installation

383
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,839
close that reopen inkscape

384
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,240
okay and now under the extensions menu

385
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,719
you've got svg2 shenzhen

386
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,920
and there are a couple options here

387
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
we're going to start with prepare

388
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,120
document

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,519
click that and so

390
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
right here we're going to put in what

391
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,320
size we want our

392
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,799
board to be and 20 by 20 millimeters

393
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,039
is pretty close to the 0.8 inches square

394
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,639
for a mini badge

395
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,240
and then you select which layers you

396
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
want to use

397
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,039
i believe the default has edge cuts

398
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,039
selected

399
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,240
might be deselected make sure all these

400
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,319
are selected

401
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,520
and we shouldn't need any of these in

402
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,959
other

403
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,120
so 20 20

404
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,559
make sure all these are selected and

405
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,360
click apply

406
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
and close that

407
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,199
so there's our little mini badge board

408
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
um

409
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
in inkscape to zoom you can't just use

410
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
the scroll wheel that'll just go up and

411
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,760
down

412
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,520
you have to hold ctrl in order to zoom

413
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,840
now this looks a little funny like

414
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,400
there's no top and left hand side of

415
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,399
this square

416
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,240
over here on the right on layers

417
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:14,559
and if these layers aren't showing up

418
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:17,840
they're up here

419
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,520
under layers that's where it is layer

420
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,399
and click layers and that'll make this

421
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,400
show up over here

422
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
you can see these are all the layers

423
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,080
that we had selected in that previous

424
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,320
dialog

425
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,918
so we scroll all the way to the bottom

426
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,200
this fixed

427
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,720
one we click the eye on that

428
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
that'll turn that off and it's out of

429
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
our way and we can see the edge of our

430
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
board here

431
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,039
so this is where we're going to create

432
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,480
our artwork

433
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,600
so first thing we need to do is decide

434
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,480
what we want on our board so

435
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
for this one for this tutorial um my

436
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,120
daughter really likes cats

437
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,559
so i'm going to create a cat face on

438
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,159
here

439
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,120
so i'm going to select this f dot silk s

440
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,080
layer now all these ones with an f in

441
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,678
the front are for

442
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,399
front and the ones with a b are for back

443
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,200
and so the f is going to be front or top

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559
of the board

445
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,480
b is the back or bottom of the board

446
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,240
so silk s is short for silk screen

447
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
and that's going to be on a traditional

448
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,799
board the white

449
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,320
color that you get mask is short for

450
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
solder mask and that's going to be the

451
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,600
colored part of your board

452
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,640
traditionally green but it can be lots

453
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,240
of different colors

454
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,919
dot cu is the copper

455
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,960
that's the actual circuits on the board

456
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,960
you can do some artwork there and then

457
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
the same three for the bottom

458
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,360
and then we've got edge cuts and that's

459
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
for making cutouts in your board or for

460
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
making

461
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,480
the outline and drill

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,400
is for putting holes in your board and

463
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
then drawings.user is something you can

464
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
use

465
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,280
just as a placeholder for things stuff

466
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,760
that's not going to end up actually on

467
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
your board

468
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,799
okay so select the f dot silk s layer

469
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,320
and then there are lots of different

470
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,360
ways to get

471
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,200
your artwork in here you can of course

472
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,799
create artwork right in here you can put

473
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,559
text on here you can draw

474
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,559
shapes you do all kinds of stuff

475
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,479
i'm going to import a file

476
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,559
i got this cute little cat picture i

477
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,080
downloaded earlier

478
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,440
so open we're gonna yeah

479
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,480
pretty much just select defaults here

480
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
and now we've got this giant image in

481
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
here

482
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,240
so we're gonna need to shrink this uh by

483
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,240
default it's gonna

484
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,960
do some weird stuff here if you hold

485
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,799
ctrl it'll make it so it keeps the same

486
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,520
proportions as you do this

487
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,039
i'm going to shrink that down drag it

488
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,158
over here

489
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,000
and zoom back in here

490
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,280
now when you're doing your artwork

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,039
you'll want to keep in mind

492
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,639
that there are those pins out here in

493
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,400
the corners

494
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,120
that you don't want your artwork to

495
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,840
overlap those

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,158
so i've got this here and it's on my

497
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,760
front silk layer

498
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,000
you can verify by clicking this little

499
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,000
eye here to turn layers on and off

500
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,879
so the way this works you don't want to

501
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
do any color stuff

502
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
in inkscape when this gets sent over to

503
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
kycad

504
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
anything that's black is what's going to

505
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
show up on that layer

506
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,440
anything that's white will not show up

507
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,559
any colors in here

508
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
aren't going to help anything

509
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,559
so since this is the silk screen and

510
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,678
silk screen on my board is going to end

511
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,520
up being white

512
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,880
anywhere that there's black there will

513
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
be white on the circuit board

514
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
anywhere there's white there won't be

515
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,520
anything there on the circuit board

516
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:18,080
so that looks pretty good we got that

517
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
so i'm gonna save this

518
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
and i'm gonna save it along with my mini

519
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
badge

520
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,960
project from kicad here

521
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
all right we got that saved now we want

522
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,520
to send this over to

523
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,520
kycad so if we go back to extensions

524
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,039
svg2 sends in

525
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,039
and click export to kaicad

526
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,240
so the folder we're going to want to

527
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
select

528
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,679
right next to where we created the

529
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,559
project

530
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,559
so let's do that

531
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,039
okay so here's my mini badge project

532
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,320
and we're going to select that

533
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,080
so now it's going to save it in my menu

534
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,678
badge project

535
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,678
export as you want module

536
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,039
you can leave thresholds and dpi

537
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,960
make sure this first checkbox is

538
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,760
selected

539
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,679
and leave these others unselected and

540
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,280
click apply

541
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,600
now this is going to generate the files

542
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:41,360
that kicad needs for the artwork

543
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,320
okay click close now we can go back to

544
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,520
kaicad

545
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,399
and import our artwork

546
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,400
go back to kaicad

547
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,840
and we're going to click on this

548
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,840
footprint editor button

549
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,279
okay and we're going to click on file

550
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:11,039
import footprint

551
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,039
and now now we're going to select our

552
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,799
footprint right here that came out of

553
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,439
inkscape

554
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,440
so we click open there's our artwork

555
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,039
so this green color see over here all

556
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,080
the layers

557
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,400
and this is our front silk screen

558
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,399
layer

559
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
and verify that's that's the only thing

560
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,480
we've got in here

561
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,080
so if we click this purple plus button

562
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
up here

563
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,240
then that is going to insert this into

564
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,239
our circuit board for us

565
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,200
so we go back to our circuit board now

566
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,559
and if we zoom out see there's our

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
artwork

568
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,480
now there are two ways to go about this

569
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,279
you can move your artwork

570
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,279
over to where your mini badge is or the

571
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,840
way i prefer to do it is to move this

572
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,440
back over here and that'll make sense in

573
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,879
a bit

574
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,799
so you can right click things and click

575
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
move you can see the shortcut here is

576
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,158
just m

577
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,559
so if i have my mouse over this press m

578
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,720
then i can move this part so i'm going

579
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,120
to move it up here

580
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,400
and then i'm going to drag and select

581
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,918
these two parts

582
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,440
over here again press m and move these

583
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,039
over here

584
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,279
okay i'm going to zoom in on

585
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:46,960
my mini badge over here

586
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,480
and we're gonna fine tune some of the

587
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
placement here

588
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,440
so i'm gonna move this again press m

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,240
and that looks pretty good

590
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,760
okay and then we're going to decide

591
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,279
where we want our led

592
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,640
and our resistor now right now

593
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,919
you can see these are red pads

594
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
and over here in the layers see red is f

595
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,039
for front copper

596
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,400
which means these parts are on the front

597
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,799
of the board right now

598
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
and if that's where you want them great

599
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,679
get them where you want

600
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,320
if you want them on the back of the

601
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,640
board then we need to flip them

602
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,080
to the back side and to do that hold

603
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,880
your mouse over it and press

604
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,678
f for flip and it'll put them on the

605
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,559
back of the board

606
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,720
you can see now this is green like these

607
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,320
the bottom copper layer here

608
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
so we can move them both to the back of

609
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,480
the board and then they'll be on the

610
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,480
bottom there

611
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,639
for this simple one we're going to leave

612
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,080
them on the front

613
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and i think we're going to move the led

614
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:56,480
over here and make the cat's nose glow

615
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,880
so got that centered about on the nose

616
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320
and then the resistor we're going to put

617
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
it

618
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,120
say down here that's not in the cat's

619
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,120
face

620
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,760
okay let's go ahead and save this

621
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
now we can

622
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,320
[Music]

623
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
finish this off what we've got to do

624
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,039
these white wires here

625
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,520
are called air wires and

626
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,200
what that's showing is just a connection

627
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,679
that needs to be made

628
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,600
all right these are generated by that

629
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
netlist file that were created from the

630
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,840
schematic

631
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
that tells us what needs to be connected

632
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
where

633
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,320
so again multiple ways to do this

634
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
there's the route tracks button over

635
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,080
here

636
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,879
or you can push x for routing don't know

637
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,320
why it's x

638
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
but that's what it is so if we click

639
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,000
that

640
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,879
then our our little crosshairs here are

641
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,520
going to snap

642
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,440
to the different points that need to be

643
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,240
have traces put on

644
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,480
so we click there and if you click you

645
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,320
see now we're dragging a trace around on

646
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
the circuit board

647
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,600
and it'll also highlight not only the

648
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
air wire

649
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,039
but also where it needs to connect to

650
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,919
and it'll snap there and then you can

651
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,720
click

652
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
and now we've got our circuit trace

653
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,799
right there

654
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,080
i'll do this with the rest of them

655
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,279
select that one

656
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,279
drag it down to there and click

657
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,640
and same with this one i'm going to

658
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
select there

659
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,440
drag this over and you'll notice it kind

660
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,199
of tries to be smart about this

661
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,799
and make the tracks as nice as it can

662
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
it's not always the smartest about how

663
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,399
it does it

664
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,240
the other thing it can do is push other

665
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,239
tracks out of the way so if you get

666
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,600
in the way of this previous one we made

667
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
it'll kind of push it

668
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,000
out of the way as you go it's gonna be

669
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
really handy so you don't have to move

670
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,640
those manually

671
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,640
so we're gonna drag this back up and

672
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,960
click there

673
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
and now this is a circuit board this is

674
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,000
a circuit board you could send off to

675
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,000
be manufactured right now

676
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,799
so escape to get out of that routing

677
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,200
mode

678
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:18,320
we're going to save this so

679
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,919
now that thing's ready to go we're going

680
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,000
to click this little bug

681
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,559
up here and that's going to do a design

682
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,480
rules check

683
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,840
you leave the defaults here that's all

684
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,679
fine click run drc down here

685
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,199
and it's going to check all these

686
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,799
different things and let you know if

687
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,320
there are any problems or any

688
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,360
unconnected

689
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
uh wires and we have none of those

690
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
so we're good

691
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,440
the other thing you can do in kycad

692
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
that's really nice is there is a

693
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,919
built-in 3d viewer

694
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,919
so on your keyboard if you press alt 3

695
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,200
it will open up the 3d viewer and show

696
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,520
you in 3d

697
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,440
what your board is going to look like so

698
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
you can click and drag

699
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,320
and see what this is going to be what

700
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,320
it's going to look like

701
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,719
now you may notice we've got our d1 and

702
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
r1

703
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
indicators there for our parts and this

704
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,080
one's pretty hidden there

705
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
and that one i don't know if we really

706
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,158
want it there it's kind of ugly

707
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,159
right in the middle of the cat's face so

708
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,440
i'll show you how to change that

709
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,960
so you can close the 3d viewer

710
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,600
now if we zoom in here here's the d1

711
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,159
and again you put your mouse over

712
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,439
anything

713
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,120
and push m for move now we're moving

714
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,480
that thing around

715
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,719
so you can move it wherever but like i

716
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,399
said it's kind of ugly

717
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:51,760
so instead we can right click

718
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:55,678
and do properties or e for edit

719
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,760
okay and here there are multiple ways

720
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,519
to change this we can change it from a

721
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,320
front silk layer to like a front

722
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,600
fab layer and a fab layer doesn't get

723
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,678
produced on the board

724
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,559
it's just there for instructions for

725
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,840
the fabricators and here again if you're

726
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
having this board professionally

727
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
assembled

728
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,640
they would need that information right

729
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,880
what parts go where

730
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,640
for us the easiest way is to uncheck

731
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,320
this visible box

732
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,600
so i click that click ok

733
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,600
now it doesn't show up

734
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,279
for the r1 down here and again

735
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,279
push m

736
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,840
and move that maybe over here

737
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,840
a little bit better and save

738
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
and

739
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,240
here again up three or under view 3d

740
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
viewer

741
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
and now we don't have that d1 there

742
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
there is still the box around the led

743
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,840
that shows you which way it goes

744
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,120
that's still pretty handy it's not too

745
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,439
obtrusive

746
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,279
so this could work um

747
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,000
like i said this is the board ready to

748
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,519
go you can send this off right now

749
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
we're going to do a couple other things

750
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,679
to it just to make it a little more

751
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,679
personalized

752
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,080
so one of the things we can do

753
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,919
right from kicad is insert text

754
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,760
so this t right here is the text tool

755
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,200
and over here we'll want to select what

756
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,120
layer we want it on

757
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,240
and here i want it on the bottom silk

758
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,158
layer

759
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,559
so i'm going to select that little arrow

760
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,650
there that one's selected now

761
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,399
and then click here and say

762
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,390
[Music]

763
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,478
designed by

764
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,479
[Music]

765
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,720
me okay so it's on

766
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
bottom silk layer uh it automatically

767
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,720
selects mirrored here because it's on

768
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,200
the bottom we want it backwards

769
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,440
okay center justified should be nice

770
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,399
because we got two lines here

771
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,880
so we click ok and now i've got this

772
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,479
text to place on the back of the board

773
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,760
i'm going to put it about right there

774
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,559
okay save save it again

775
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,960
and now if we go back to our 3d viewer

776
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,639
you turn this over now we've got some

777
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,360
nice text there that says who it was

778
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,360
designed by

779
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,320
all right this is looking pretty good

780
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,440
okay so that's one way we can do this

781
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,720
um so let's go back to inkscape and i'll

782
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,760
show you a couple other things you can

783
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
do with your mini badge

784
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,039
if we go back here

785
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,960
one thing people like to do on their

786
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,080
boards is cutouts

787
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,279
so over here on your layers

788
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,480
go down to your edge cuts layer

789
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,480
we can do some cutouts

790
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,000
again this is going to be a very

791
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,040
personal choice on how you want this

792
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,079
to look what you want it to be like

793
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,279
um so

794
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,639
maybe i want a

795
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,800
star cutout um

796
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,599
so i'm going to click and drag this star

797
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
cut out here

798
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,280
and this is on the edge cuts layer which

799
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,320
happens to be underneath

800
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
this other layer so over here i'm going

801
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,839
to

802
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,719
click the little eye button on the front

803
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,599
silk layer

804
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,759
so we don't have to see that now i've

805
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,960
got this star shape

806
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,679
and maybe i want it

807
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,679
right in the middle

808
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,800
okay so let's see

809
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,160
that's going to be maybe we don't want

810
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,520
it quite that big that's going to be our

811
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,359
whole

812
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,480
cat face so i'm gonna

813
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,480
shrink this down

814
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:17,839
and try to position it maybe over the

815
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,839
nose and mouth there

816
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,480
all right i think that'll work so now

817
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,520
we've got this on our edge cuts layer

818
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,119
which is going to make a cutout now this

819
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,920
shape

820
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,079
uh we're going to be limited by what the

821
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,359
board manufacturer can actually do

822
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,400
so they're going to take a little tiny

823
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,839
router bit

824
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,240
and put it in here and cut this outline

825
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,480
now

826
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,160
these router bits that are going to cut

827
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,599
this are round

828
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,118
so you're not going to get these sharp

829
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,800
points in the corners they're going to

830
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,760
be rounded off

831
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,400
if that's okay with you then great

832
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,640
otherwise

833
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,240
maybe pick a different shape something

834
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,240
circular with soft edges

835
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,040
okay so we've got that now

836
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,200
i'm going to save this and then go back

837
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,960
up to accessories and

838
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
you know what before i do that i'm going

839
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,520
to add some other text

840
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,079
on this maybe something better because

841
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
the options in kai-cat aren't that great

842
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,280
so

843
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,240
i'm going to go to my bottom silk layer

844
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,359
here

845
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,040
actually i'm going to turn off this

846
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,440
front silk layer again so it's not in my

847
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,320
way

848
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,280
so bottom silk layer and then i'm going

849
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:41,839
to select

850
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:41,839
text here and i'm going to do

851
00:36:50,640 --> 00:37:00,720
and we'll put 2020 on there all right

852
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:05,599
so zoom out a little here

853
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,598
and shrink this down

854
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,479
and we're going to want this centered

855
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,480
on the text here

856
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
we go text and then click text and font

857
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,000
up here

858
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,720
that'll give us the text and font tools

859
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,640
over here

860
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,640
so normal is good

861
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:38,078
and what are other options here

862
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:51,839
i apologize i am not a master at

863
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:51,839
inkscape it's not my forte

864
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,839
all i want to do is center the text

865
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:16,560
i can at least make it bold that's good

866
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,560
change to a better font here

867
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
um

868
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,480
maybe something like that

869
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,279
and then again because this is going on

870
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,520
the bottom we'll want to mirror it

871
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,520
so

872
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,040
in here

873
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,200
this one is the horizontal flip

874
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,920
button so if we click that now it's

875
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,919
backwards here

876
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,720
so we've got that on our bottom silk

877
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
layer and it's out of the way of our

878
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,359
cutout here

879
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,800
so that's good turn back on our front

880
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,680
silk

881
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,720
that's good okay so go back up to

882
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,480
extensions

883
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,319
sgg to shenzhen export to kaicad

884
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,520
and everything's the same we can just

885
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
click apply

886
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,359
and that's going to overwrite our

887
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,480
previous file

888
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,680
close that now if we go back to kai-cad

889
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,680
if you've still got your footprint

890
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,200
editor open go ahead and

891
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,480
click on that and now back to

892
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,000
file import footprint

893
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,960
and it's going to ask if we want to save

894
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,320
this previous one and we don't

895
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,000
a discard and then we'll reimport

896
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,359
the new file open and now we've got all

897
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,359
kinds of stuff here

898
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,359
so now we've got our bottom silk screen

899
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,119
there we've got our cutout

900
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:53,119
on our yellow edge cuts layer here

901
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:57,839
so now what we can do is

902
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,839
go back to our board here we can select

903
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,599
our previous artwork here

904
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,240
now i should have explained what

905
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,160
happened there when i clicked

906
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,000
it gives me a notification to clarify

907
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,799
selection so what that means is where i

908
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,119
clicked

909
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
it doesn't know if i selected either of

910
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,160
these two things

911
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,680
so it asked me to select which one i

912
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,319
wanted x1 if you remember is

913
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,720
the name of our mini badge footprint out

914
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,759
here

915
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
so i'm not trying to select that so the

916
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,280
default for

917
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,000
an imported piece of artwork is just

918
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
this ref

919
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,440
because it doesn't have a reference from

920
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,560
the schematic

921
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,480
it's blank so select that

922
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,200
that'll be our artwork and we're going

923
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,200
to delete it

924
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,040
so now we go back to our footprint

925
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,440
editor

926
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,759
and we click this purple plus again

927
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,040
that's going to insert the new artwork

928
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,079
into our circuit board

929
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,920
and this is where it's really handy to

930
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,680
move your parts to your artwork

931
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
rather than moving your artwork to your

932
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,520
parts because now anytime we want to

933
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,319
change something in the artwork

934
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,079
we can just re-import it throw it right

935
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,680
back in here and it's exactly in the

936
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,280
place it was before we don't have to

937
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,000
bother moving it around and trying to

938
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,079
put it back where it was

939
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,839
so now that i've got my fancy text in

940
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,920
there i'm going to select

941
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,680
the one i made in head and delete

942
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,599
that

943
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,078
and now we've got a cutout in our board

944
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,640
which means that this led i don't want

945
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,480
it there

946
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,078
on it can't go there because there's no

947
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,040
board gear

948
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,400
so i'm going to click m and again it

949
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,680
wants to know what i'm trying to move

950
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,440
here

951
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,240
and d1 is our led

952
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,480
so i want to move that somewhere else

953
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,959
now

954
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,040
because i've got a cutout here and mini

955
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,240
badges are designed to have

956
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,319
a shiny part behind the board i can

957
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,479
actually put this led on the bottom

958
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,599
of the board and the light will shine

959
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,160
through that cutout

960
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,960
in my circuit board so to put it on the

961
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,078
bottom again

962
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,359
f for flip now it's on the bottom

963
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,800
and i think i want this one

964
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,119
the led down here underneath that cutout

965
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,480
i'm going to put that there now i've got

966
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,319
these tracks

967
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,760
all over here and you can click on them

968
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,960
one by one

969
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,880
and press delete that's kind of it takes

970
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,079
a while it's kind of a pain

971
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,480
you could put your mouse over it and

972
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,000
press delete

973
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,960
um if you select the the tracks button

974
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,680
here

975
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,640
and then put your mouse over it when you

976
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,000
press delete

977
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,640
it will delete the entire string of that

978
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,599
trace

979
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,839
from end to end which makes it a little

980
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,760
quicker

981
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,160
if you're trying to delete a bunch of

982
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,160
tracks

983
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,480
okay so now i'm going to move this

984
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,359
resistor

985
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,359
again press m

986
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,000
select your r1 and i'm also going to

987
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,880
flip this

988
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,880
and put it on the back

989
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,319
and now on the back it doesn't matter so

990
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,079
much where i put it right i've got my

991
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,240
my lettering up here so i don't want to

992
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,560
cover that up but i'm not worried about

993
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,279
the

994
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,560
cat artwork that's on the front so i'm

995
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,319
going to put it

996
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:34,720
say right there now

997
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:39,119
you can see that the air wires here

998
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,919
are going to the weird side of this led

999
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,599
that's maybe not as nice for having to

1000
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,079
actually put these traces in here we

1001
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,200
could definitely do it

1002
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,079
but maybe we want to rotate this led so

1003
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,240
we can just push

1004
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
r it's going to ask us which thing we

1005
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,399
want to rotate again

1006
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,598
d1 and we're going to do that one more

1007
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,319
time

1008
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,079
e1 it's rotated and now you're going to

1009
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,359
take this trace and put it around this

1010
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,200
side of this cut out

1011
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,720
and this one right here and that one up

1012
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,960
and we're done

1013
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,240
so let's go ahead and do that again push

1014
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,520
the button over here or press

1015
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,399
x and select this and now if you'll

1016
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,040
notice

1017
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,760
kycat is smart enough to not let us go

1018
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,839
through

1019
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,079
that cutout so we're going to go around

1020
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,599
here

1021
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,640
and if you i clicked there so that i can

1022
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,960
kind of

1023
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,279
save that progress of the trace and then

1024
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,319
continue it over here

1025
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,240
click there and then this one

1026
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:42,240
select there up here and click

1027
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:46,078
and do this one click

1028
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,118
and now our board is routed again okay

1029
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,960
escape save now

1030
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,920
we're gonna go back to our 3d viewer and

1031
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,920
see what this looks like

1032
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,119
okay so you can see now we've got that

1033
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,359
star cut out of our board

1034
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,400
now if we rotate this around now our

1035
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,520
parts are on the back

1036
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,960
as our led there's our resistor

1037
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,359
the nicer font we got out of inkscape

1038
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,040
and you'll notice this part of the silk

1039
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,119
screen is still showing up there over

1040
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,079
the cutout

1041
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,640
now most board houses you send them your

1042
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
board

1043
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,440
anywhere there's a cutout or there's a

1044
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,280
exposed copper pad like this

1045
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,880
they will automatically just remove the

1046
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,000
silk screen from that so you don't need

1047
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,040
to worry about it

1048
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,839
just leave it like it is so now if we

1049
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,839
were to create this

1050
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,640
we would have that cut out there and

1051
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,040
then this little bit of the whiskers

1052
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,118
suck screen sticking out there and then

1053
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,920
our cat's nose would glow

1054
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,319
with the reflected led from the shiny

1055
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,520
back

1056
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,319
that's on whatever you're plugging the

1057
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,319
mini badge into

1058
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,680
all right in here you can

1059
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,119
change all kinds of things if you want

1060
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,759
under preferences

1061
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,640
you can choose colors you can change all

1062
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,000
these colors

1063
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,759
to whatever you want since we're having

1064
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,359
these boards made at osh park

1065
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
they're gonna end up being purple silk

1066
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,359
screen or you can choose the

1067
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,279
they've got a different option that's

1068
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,560
kind of a black and

1069
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,920
copper color so just for fun

1070
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,240
we'll show what that looks like so

1071
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,040
solder mask is the color the green here

1072
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,799
that's going to be purple from osh park

1073
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,160
click that and

1074
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,720
define colors select purple

1075
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,440
okay and now it's going to show us what

1076
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,439
this would look like

1077
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:46,800
pretty cool all right

1078
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,680
let's close that so

1079
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,560
that's it that's how to design a mini

1080
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,279
badge

1081
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,279
from here it's all just making the

1082
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,359
artwork exactly the way you want it

1083
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,400
tweaking things and that's about it

1084
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:08,880
the next step for this is

1085
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,880
sending it off to have it be produced
