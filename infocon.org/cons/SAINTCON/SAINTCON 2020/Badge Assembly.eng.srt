1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,480
all right today i'm going to show you

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,398
how to assemble the saintcon 2020 badge

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,160
so you should receive this kit of parts

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,800
as well as the 8 pin headers in your

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
choice of color

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,239
let's see what we've got here

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,919
so i've got the lanyard

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
this piece of paper is very important

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,759
don't throw it away

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
here instead of this test code will be a

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
unique code

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,679
that is your gift code for creating your

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
own mini badge on oshpark.com

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
and we'll talk about that in another

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
video

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,519
hang on to that so these are your mini

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,879
badge holder boards

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,960
that'll go around the outside of the

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,559
ball got

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,520
pins led resistors battery holder

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,760
eight red leds this is the main board

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
there are two horizontal boards that are

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,599
the same

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
and then one vertical board here i also

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,879
have

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
the official saint con 2020 mini badge

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
and

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,960
this is the daughter board that has the

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,158
microcontroller and the brains for the

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,479
badge

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,760
so first thing we're going to start with

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
is the main board here

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,400
and we're going to solder this on now

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,839
if you look closely here on the edge

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
there are these little scalloped

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
kind of half holes on the side here and

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,679
that's what we're going to solder onto

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,920
the pads here so this line's up there

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
let me zoom in on this for you

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
so there's a white outline where the

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
board goes

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
just line that up and now we're going to

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,320
solder each one of those pads

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
so if you haven't soldered before this

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240
is surface mount

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,240
and the best way to do surface mount

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,640
is to put some solder on one of these

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
pads

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,679
and then move the part into position

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,840
over the pad

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,840
and re-melt it

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,160
okay and then check your alignment

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,920
mine's a tad bit off here

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,359
okay so now that they're all aligned we

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:37,839
can go ahead and

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:37,840
solder all these up

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
um

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
okay now that's soldered on next thing

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
we're going to do

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
is these leds

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
you can just pull them right out of here

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
out of the paper

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:47,840
or you can also cut them off with some

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,840
side cutters

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,680
okay so there are multiple ways to

66
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,120
figure out which way these go into the

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,200
board

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,080
so the shorter of the two legs

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,159
is the cathode or negative side of it

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,080
which is going to go into the square

71
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:13,280
hole here on the board there is also

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
a flat side of the led a little hard to

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
make out on camera but one side is

74
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,358
flattened

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
and that lines up with the flat side of

76
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,758
the silk screen here on the board

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,120
so go ahead and put these in

78
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,000
the way i like to do this is to put in

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
the four from one side and then when you

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
flip it over

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
the board will sit nice and flat on all

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
four leds at once

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,040
so kind of hold on to the led pins in

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,560
the back when you flip it over

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,320
and make sure they're standing straight

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,080
up so the leds are straight

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,000
on the back and then

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,440
go ahead and solder i like to solder one

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
pin on each one

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
and then flip it over and make sure that

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
all the leds are flat and aligned and

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,359
not

93
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,359
pointing a weird way

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,840
and these all look pretty good so we'll

95
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,840
solder the other side

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:39,840
okay now take your cutters

97
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,840
trim off the excess leads here

98
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:53,840
and now we're going to put in the other

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:53,840
four leds

100
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:35,840
those ones look pretty good

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,080
okay so at this point we want to test

102
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,919
this board and make sure that all our

103
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
leds work before we put all the other

104
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,840
parts on

105
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,120
and then we can't get to it anymore so

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,159
there are multiple ways to test this

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
right now since we don't have the

108
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
battery holder on yet if you have a

109
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
micro usb

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,639
cable you can plug that in and test

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,880
it okay so those four are working

112
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,840
just back those four are working good

113
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
so that's it for that

114
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,840
now we'll go ahead and put the battery

115
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,840
holder on

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,000
battery holder goes on the back of this

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
board

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,840
solder those two leads there

119
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,360
and it's also a good idea to go ahead

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,599
and put some batteries in this

121
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
to check it real quick just to make sure

122
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,840
that it works

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,840
with batteries

124
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,679
okay it's working pretty well test that

125
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,758
your button works and changes the

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
led modes around to all the different

127
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,080
things

128
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,440
cool all right now

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,000
it's time for the fun part move on to

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,320
putting the sides on this thing

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,360
so direction does matter on these parts

132
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,959
so we're going to grab this

133
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,159
vertical board here and if you'll notice

134
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,919
there's a notch here

135
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,760
cut out of it and there's a notch cut

136
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,439
out of the main board here

137
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,560
and so those are going to slot into each

138
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,600
other now

139
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,359
it's a direction matters on this so

140
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,519
you notice there are silver pads here

141
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,640
on the sides that should line up when

142
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
this is

143
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,199
put in okay and then there are lower

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,720
ones on the other side

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,720
put this and backwards

146
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,440
then those pads

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,000
don't line up maybe a little hard to see

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,920
on video let me see if i can

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
zoom in a bit here and focus on this

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
and of course the shiny reflects those

151
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,279
pads

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
but right now they definitely do not

153
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,959
line up

154
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
so if we flip this over

155
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,440
you can see those two pads line up

156
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
and then on the back side

157
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,839
they line up there okay

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
so now we got that the right way

159
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,599
just kind of leave that there for now

160
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
don't solder it yet

161
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
and we're going to put these on now

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,120
these ones

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,959
direction also matters here and

164
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
there's letters on the back and there's

165
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,839
these circle patterns on the top

166
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,839
so those go up right here

167
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,839
slot this in

168
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
and here again where it's connected to

169
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,399
the main board

170
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,439
you'll notice the pads line up here if

171
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,279
they don't you've got it backwards

172
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,600
okay now put the other one on the other

173
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
side

174
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,240
that in so

175
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
this is now the ball structure now you

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,600
notice there's a little bit of

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,880
movement in these parts right so

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
when we're soldering this we're going to

179
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,439
try to hold it so that everything is

180
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
straight

181
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
as much as possible and lines up

182
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,279
okay so using a rubber band or something

183
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,360
like that would be helpful here

184
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
to kind of hold things together

185
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,200
but if you kind of set it down

186
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:43,839
you may be able to find a place where it

187
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:43,839
holds together well

188
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:57,839
all right so the rubber band here

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
just gonna kind of

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
put this around the ball and see if

191
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
that'll

192
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:11,839
hold it in place a little better here

193
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,839
make it easier to solder it

194
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
okay

195
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,880
so in alignment that looks pretty good

196
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:38,800
so i'm going to start with this pad

197
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:40,480
right here

198
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,479
i've got that soldered and now i'm going

199
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
to look here and see

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,959
how we're looking on alignment looks

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
pretty good

202
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
so now we're just going to go around and

203
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:07,839
solder all of these

204
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:07,839
on all the different parts here

205
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,990
[Music]

206
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,320
okay that's all of them

207
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,599
so now the structure of our ball is

208
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
complete

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
now we'll go on to the mini badge

210
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,839
holders

211
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,560
so these are all in a panel

212
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
but the individual boards have been

213
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,839
scored and v-cut

214
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,839
so you can just snap these apart

215
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,839
now as you're doing this you may notice

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,160
that some of these are a little bit

217
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,160
different so

218
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:30,880
there are four of them that are

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:34,560
different than the others

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,519
so if we say that the

221
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,399
rows of holes are top and bottom then

222
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
you've got a bunch

223
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,959
that have these slots in the middle

224
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,199
vertical these four are horizontal

225
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,119
so when you're when we're putting the

226
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,719
ball together with these on it

227
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,920
pay attention to that so we get these

228
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
all in the right orientation

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,279
so now go ahead and grab your headers

230
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
and the laborious part of this begins

231
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
where we got to solder

232
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:13,839
all these headers on to all 17 of these

233
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:13,839
mini badge holders

234
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,759
again i solder one pad and flip it over

235
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
to see

236
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,399
these aren't quite straight so

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,839
i'm gonna hold them and re-solder to get

238
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,839
these nice and straight

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,839
and once they're straight go ahead and

240
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,839
solder the rest

241
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,839
all right only 16 more to go

242
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:44,880
all right so now we've got all

243
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,360
17 of these with our headers soldered

244
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
onto them

245
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,320
now when we go to put these on the ball

246
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
all right i said these four have the

247
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,200
horizontal ones

248
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
and get all the others out of the way

249
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
do these four first so we don't put them

250
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,480
in the wrong spot

251
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,320
so these four are going to go on these

252
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,360
horizontal boards here

253
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,360
these four places

254
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,320
now if you look at these one of those

255
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,960
slots is wider than the other one

256
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,399
and that lines up with these different

257
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,280
sized tabs here

258
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,679
try to put it on backwards one tab will

259
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,000
fit

260
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,600
one won't and it just won't fit on right

261
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,760
so make sure you've got these the right

262
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,159
orientation they should slide on just

263
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
fine

264
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
you'll see both tabs sticking up there

265
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
and then

266
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,120
you can go ahead and solder this

267
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
there is a little bit of wiggle here so

268
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,399
just like before

269
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
it helps to put solder on one of these

270
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
joints

271
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
and then check it make sure it's

272
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,879
straight

273
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,840
if it's not go ahead and re-melt it and

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
adjust it

275
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,559
and once it's the way you want it go

276
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:11,840
ahead and put solder on the other

277
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:11,840
three joints

278
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,879
now just 16 more to go

279
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:39,840
we'll do these horizontal boards first

280
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:39,840
let's get those done

281
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
all right so now we've got those four

282
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,720
soldered onto the horizontal boards

283
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,000
just got to put on the other 13. now

284
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:07,840
order here is completely up to you

285
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,840
they just all have to go on

286
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,760
can be a little trickier getting these

287
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
ones soldered since the

288
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,799
headers are a little bit in your way

289
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,399
when you're doing this

290
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,918
normally you want to go sideways against

291
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
the pad but

292
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,159
a little hard with the big plastic

293
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,158
header stick in there

294
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,840
so just take your time

295
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,520
all right there we have it it's now

296
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,720
complete

297
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,480
so now we need a mini badge to test make

298
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,400
sure this thing works

299
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,400
so let's go ahead and assemble that mini

300
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,600
badge

301
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,000
all right so here's this year's mini

302
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
badge

303
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
this was designed by my lovely wife

304
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,960
and there's a resistor and an led that

305
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,960
goes on the back of it

306
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,158
now you may notice that

307
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
the parts that you got are more than you

308
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,200
need for this mini badge

309
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,640
that is because they go for the mini

310
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
badges that you are going to create

311
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,200
yourself

312
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,600
as part of this so you've got

313
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,520
four four leds four resistors

314
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,199
and 16 of these pins this is enough for

315
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,200
this mini badge plus three more

316
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,639
so first thing we're going to do is get

317
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,360
one of these leds out

318
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
now on these packs of surface mount

319
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,559
parts

320
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,000
there's this little plastic cover tape

321
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
that's over the parts

322
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,039
so you get some tweezers under there and

323
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,799
kind of pull it back

324
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,799
and reveal one of the leds

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,840
so this led

326
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,199
there polarity matters on this if you

327
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,840
look at the bottom

328
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
there's a little green notch that is on

329
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,039
one side of it

330
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
so that side is going to be the cathode

331
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,520
or negative side of the led

332
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,439
and that is going to go

333
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
right here on this side if you notice

334
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,159
around this there is this

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,639
white border around three sides but not

336
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,679
the other side

337
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,559
that is because that side

338
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,520
is the anode or positive this is cathode

339
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,158
and then it's going to go through the

340
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:36,960
resistor

341
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:39,919
into ground

342
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
okay so just like with all the other

343
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,799
surface mount stuff

344
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,200
we're gonna put solder on one pad here

345
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,039
and pick this up and again make sure

346
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
that the little green notch on the back

347
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
is pointing

348
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,720
towards this side towards the capped off

349
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,400
end of this

350
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,400
here and we're going to solder that on

351
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,520
then we're going to add some solder to

352
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,960
the other side

353
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
now we're going to grab a resistor

354
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,439
and do the same thing solder on one side

355
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,960
and solder there now for the pins

356
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
it's pretty important that these go in

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,240
straight if they're crooked they're not

358
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,240
going to fit in

359
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,679
now trick i like to use is

360
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
if you have something that holds many

361
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,760
badges like the badge you just built

362
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,000
then you can use this

363
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,559
to hold your pins

364
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
while you solder it so i'm going to

365
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,080
stick these

366
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,080
in here

367
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,720
now of course make sure your badge is

368
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,440
powered off before you do this

369
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
you don't want to be soldering this well

370
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,760
there's power

371
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,000
on it so stick your mini badge on there

372
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:29,840
and it's going to hold all your pins

373
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,840
straight while you solder these

374
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,559
okay so there we have it

375
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,879
now let's see if it works

376
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,200
indeed it does our led on our mini badge

377
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
is on

378
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,559
everything on our badge is working

379
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,400
so that's it the only thing left to do

380
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,039
is design your very own mini badge that

381
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:10,320
you can

382
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:10,320
bring to saintcon next year
