[Laughter]

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,679

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,200
all right what are we doing here chris

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
you called us all together what's the

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,920
deal

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,839
absolutely because i'm just getting

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
bored and pope looked like he was having

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
so much fun

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
and the real truth is is that saint

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,599
kahn's around the corner and i'm super

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,078
excited

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,800
just totally missing everybody though

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,640
it's

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
tell you what those uh we usually work

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
from troy's i'm missing that like

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
nobody's business

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
so always good to see people so but

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,520
anyway

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
what we want to do on this one uh

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
specifically is talk about

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
how to mentor and raise the next gen

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,519
next generation of hackers

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
and i use of course hackers in the nice

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
word

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
and not in the malicious word which may

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
run into a few of the answers that we're

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
having

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
we're going to talk about as well let's

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
just do some quick introductions across

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
the room

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,840
i'll start with me i'm chris morgan uh

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
i'm the really big dude

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
and believe it or not troy had to get a

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,199
bigger dude to replace kelly and so he

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,320
picked me um

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,479
it's just how it goes so apparently

45
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
first of all there's no replacing kelly

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,960
by the way

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,479
that's so true yeah i miss that guy

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
yeah we're trying to get kelly on here

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,439
wasn't able to do it um

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
which is unfortunate so we're gonna try

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,720
some more maybe we can get him to send

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,240
some stuff in for us

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,079
um but i uh

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,960
for me i've always just done security

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,360
with my job never 100 security

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
i love it i love mentoring wait wait

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,600
wait wait

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
you didn't give us your handle like how

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,919
who you are like

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,798

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,599
surrash room yep sir did you get them or

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
where'd you get it what's it what's it

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,079
about

75
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,200
sure absolutely um i

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,519
am a giant nerd hence the other one um

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,040
in the days of free email which a lot of

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
these kids don't understand that there

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,319
was such a thing as

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,920
you had to either pay or find free email

81
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
i had to come up with a screen name that

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
was unique because my name is

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
chris morgan and you can't get more

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,799
bland than that

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,679
so here's another side story to this

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,840
story i used to work federal government

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
and they start implementing email for

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,120
life because they kept ticking up too

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
high especially with contractors

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
i was a contractor for them and so every

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
time you go in

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,799
you get a new contract and go get a

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,680
different job and maybe come back be a

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,280
contractor you would get

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
uh an email with your full name so

96
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,480
christopher.morgan.com3400c.gov or

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
whatever yeah

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
yeah yeah and so it just and i'm not

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
even kidding like i did it three times

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
in a row because on bubble contracts and

101
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,879
it went from like

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,000
dot 46.us.af.mill

103
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,079
to 97.

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
and that was within like a total of six

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
months so

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
that is one of the problems with the

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
name like chris morgan

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,760
i love my name why we invented handles

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,958
you know there are a million troy's

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
there's a million chris

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,599
there's a there's a quadrillion daves

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,879
jeremy maybe a little less popular but

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
still there's a lot of those

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
so there's only there's only one therm

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,760
though we know all know that

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,238
that's true um and so i picked something

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
that would be so random

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
that i could get email addresses and

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,480
usernames without anyone else running

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,399
into it in this sir ashram which comes

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,159
from an anime

122
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
i'm not gonna tell you which one because

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
i would love to see if anyone can pick

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
it out if they pick it out i'll send you

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,840
a mini badge

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,840
um okay

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
okay i was gonna say like google doesn't

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
know what this is or

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
or whatever they should cool i would

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,440
hope so but i really want someone

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,880
to have actually seen the series so

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,560
um and that's where that comes from and

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,320
it just stuck forever because it was

134
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
always available

135
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,759
very rarely would i find someone else

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,919
with it on

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,919
a game server or or whatever

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,919
nice so that's what i stuck with forever

139
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,799
and it's been great

140
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,280
um that's that's pretty much how my

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,000
handle comes about

142
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,159
security is just uh coming the security

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,039
world is just a lot of fun

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,800
i always work general i i'm a system

145
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
administrator which just means i do

146
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,160
everything in the world so

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,119
and i work for companies because i've

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,880
worked government

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,880
both federal and public and

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
i've come from places where they really

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,680
narrow down your jobs

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
and i don't like that i don't like the

153
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,199
granularization

154
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
of you're the third ex microsoft

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
exchange

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
server admin and if you do that as your

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,880
job i'm not

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,280
i'm not telling you no that's a great

159
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
job but not for me

160
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,440
and so everywhere i've been i've been a

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
network

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,360
administrator assistant administrator

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,440
and a security engineer

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
and it's a lot of extra work and it's

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,120
all i i find it way too enjoyable

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,479
so cool um i can't remember if i got any

167
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
more questions out of there

168
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,680
but that's what you got if anyone wants

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,599

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
chris's story i was looking for

326
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,880
a handle that uh that that i could

327
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,319
relate to

328
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,160
uh that nobody else had and one of the

329
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
rules was make it as long as possible

330
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,959
right

331
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,800
make it as long as absolutely possible

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,638
and one that i could buy a dot-com for

333
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,639
by the way um

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200

336
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,639
and that was gosh that was a long time

337
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,199
ago

338
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
um and since then there have been a few

339
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
and that's okay

340
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,479
but that have jumped on it but that's

341
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,600
that's my story nice thing for mine is

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,240
most people bailed on my my handle i

343
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,079
don't see it anywhere

344
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
wow it's great that makes it unique

345
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,120
which is cool i love it

346
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,479
this is cool just means i'm old school

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,600
and love a really old anime

348
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,440
so that's all right i'm cool with that

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
nice all right so i think we all know

350
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,040
who troy is i think most people know who

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
troy is

352
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,480
and troy got his handle from the train

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,639
that went through utah

354
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
um

355
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,000
no actually uh so i've brought a couple

356
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,639
of handles over my over the years

357
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
uh jupiter's the one i like the most but

358
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
jupiter because you have a roman god

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
complex and you're going for the god of

360
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
all

361
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,760
right absolutely is that what the

362
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,279
jupiter is the

363
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,399
god of all no so um you know back

364
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,720
the the way jupiter came around is a

365
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
number of years ago when we were hosting

366
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
the the defcon capture the flag

367
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,479
competition

368
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,680
um there was a year where nobody knew

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
who was

370
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,599
hosting the competition who was actually

371
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
running it behind the scenes and so it

372
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
was my job

373
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
to kind of be the front man because i

374
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,959
was kind of an unknown in that space

375
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,560
up until that point it helped out and

376
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
played in competitions and other things

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,279
before that but

378
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,040
um we were i was helping out and all of

379
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,839
the different people inside of our group

380
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,800
picked names of the planets and so by

381
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,800
the time

382
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,199
it got to round to me the only planet

383
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
left was jupiter so you know we had mars

384
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,199
and mercury

385
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,399
and venus and i don't think anybody

386
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,599
picked uranus but

387
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,959
uh you know was this the time you guys

388
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
were both running and

389
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,560
competing in the ctf uh might have been

390
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
that year

391
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,119
that year

392
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,319
but it's been long enough ago no they

393
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
did not win

394
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
uh we didn't cheat that we recused

395
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
ourselves from being able to win but

396
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,920
yeah but yeah so that's that's where

397
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,040
jupiter got stuck and that's what i

398
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,000
started getting known

399
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
by uh in the defcon scene and some of

400
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,480
the broader

401
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,560
hacker communities out there and so that

402
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,519
one's the one i've had to stick with

403
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,800
a three-syllable uh handle is sometimes

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
a mouthful but

405
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,599
hey it works jupiter's jupiter it is

406
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,199
so that's me we'll take it

407
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,399
well again thanks for everyone being

408
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,760
here and having this kind of fun so

409
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,279
let's start with the

410
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,800
the first part though when we talk about

411
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
mentoring

412
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,439
what do you what do you put into that

413
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,040
what would be mentoring to you

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
when you talk about mentoring the youth

415
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,319
of today the next generation

416
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,240
and that's a question for anyone one two

417
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,759
three not it

418
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,199
so for example i have kids that i mentor

419
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,040
and i mentor a couple other people at

420
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,719
work too and they have questions

421
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,599
um especially so i'll start that basic

422
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
level one

423
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,639
is mentoring just the co-workers i have

424
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
new old whatever and then that

425
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,240
generation to understand

426
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
is i think the first thing i think

427
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,639
mentoring starts out for me as

428
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
as i start mentoring people is to get

429
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
the comprehension and understanding of

430
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,880
what this is

431
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,800
and why it's important and i think leads

432
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,839
to the

433
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,758
the interest that little spark of this

434
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,120
is really fun this is cool or this might

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,000
even be scary

436
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
right sir you had something well i was

437
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,120
thinking a majority of what i've done

438
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,560
for coworkers

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,480
is it's encouragement because they feel

440
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
really dumb when they first start

441
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
if they're actually any good they will

442
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,600
come in and be blown away

443
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,479
by the the learning curve that's in the

444
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,759
beginning

445
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,880
i had one co-worker he just recently he

446
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,519
became the splunk dude like the one

447
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,240
splunk guy for a billion dollar company

448
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,680
and he didn't know linux or anything so

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
i sat down the first day i told him like

450
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,239
relax dude

451
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,319
you know we all know that you only have

452
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
a year under your belt straight out of

453
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,120
college

454
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,560
and actually bought him a linux bible

455
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
one of those linux books that i've used

456
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,199
over the years i'm like

457
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,880
here's a starting point and oh in the

458
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,880
last three years that he's been

459
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
an admin he's probably the best linux

460
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,039
guys with that corporation now

461
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,439
um i think just the the encouragement

462
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,618
you know and that we've all been there

463
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,880
and there's my mom's dog

464
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:14,480
[Laughter]

465
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,959
yeah i live with my mom leave me alone

466
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,760
guys nothing wrong with that

467
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
nothing wrong at all you know i it's

468
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
interesting because thurman and i have

469
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,280
just

470
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
recently been talking about this

471
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,319
particular thing haven't we

472
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,360
um and you know as we talk about

473
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,399
mentoring the younger generation

474
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,719
um it's it's really important in

475
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,919
in that that when they start to show

476
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,120
some potential um capability

477
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,000
at a young age that we steer them in the

478
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,439
correct path

479
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,480
um so that that one they don't

480
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,600
you know jump ship and go all the way

481
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,360
down

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,879
the slippery slide at the bottom where

483
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
it's not so good

484
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,360
um but then they also don't feel like

485
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,399
hey that they feel encouraged

486
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,000
um to to continue with those skills and

487
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,960
continue to develop those

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
uh those things that they can do because

489
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,840
so often

490
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
in our in our day if you have a kid that

491
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,520
you know does something that's

492
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,160
considered hacking it's like oh my gosh

493
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,799
uh you know oh we've got to take action

494
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
on this

495
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,160
kid um because you know he's done

496
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,360
something terribly bad

497
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,240
you know in reality his only crime was

498
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
he was curious and just wanted to see um

499
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
and he wasn't really trying to be

500
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,799
malicious in any way

501
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,720
most of the time that's the case now

502
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,000
there there is those occasional times

503
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
when it's not

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,640
um but you've got to be conscientious of

505
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,280
how you deal with those kids

506
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
um so you don't push them to the wrong

507
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,039
direction

508
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,000
um and that you can encourage uh them

509
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,000
building those skills

510
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,918
i like that um when you talk about the

511
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,200
the

512
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
down the right path encouraging the

513
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,280
right path

514
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,640
um that's an interesting one i remember

515
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,399
talking to my sister about it because

516
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
she was kept asking me about saying khan

517
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
as well

518
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,918
she's like what are you teaching the

519
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
kids i'm like we teach them to think

520
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
like hackers

521
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,480
she's like okay what does that mean i'm

522
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
like that means to question everything

523
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
that means to try new things and try and

524
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,639
break things she's like okay i don't

525
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,360
want my kids breaking things you know

526
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
and i get that and subverting right it's

527
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,799
all subversion

528
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
you tell me i can i can't do something

529
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,240
i'm gonna find a new way to do it

530
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
i'm gonna question the way it's done

531
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,840
until i can figure out

532
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
what i can do without breaking

533
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,320
the rules um so when you say correct

534
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,679
path can you expand on that a little bit

535
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,918
for us jared

536
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
yeah well you know there's obviously a

537
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
couple of different ways to go down this

538
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,199
career um

539
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,399
i mean you can you can either go down

540
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,280
the ethical path or the non-ethical path

541
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
and and we certainly want to encourage

542
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,918
people to

543
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,919
to do the right um the right thing and

544
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,840
and be ethical in the way that they

545
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,080
approach those types of things

546
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,360
um because there are plenty of employ

547
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,480
there's plenty of employment on both

548
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,120
sides isn't there

549
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
um but uh we we definitely want to

550
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
encourage

551
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,799
um to do it the right way and so i think

552
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,158
that's what i'm talking about

553
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,520
the the generally when

554
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,159
when you take a kid and you punish them

555
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,280
um for their curiosity and their desire

556
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,600
to learn

557
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,559
um and and all they ever see is

558
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
punishment

559
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,000
there's two ways that can go they can

560
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,158
either rebel

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,080
um which will send them down the wrong

562
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
path ultimately

563
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,480
or could not necessarily but it it

564
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,440
definitely could it's the start

565
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
or or or they'll just stop all together

566
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,799
and

567
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,158
and then that's a that's a loss of of

568
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,840
of talent so that's

569
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,600
i think that that needs to be approached

570
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,240
very uh

571
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
wisely

572
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,360
and i know from you mentioned that you

573
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,280
worked in the washington school district

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,678
for a long time now

575
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,678
um have you seen changes to help that

576
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,000
out

577
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,640
or is it something that you get to see

578
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,039
at all from where you stand

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
yeah i was gonna say i assume that you

580
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,400
have to deal with

581
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:32,320
any kind of issue like that

582
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,240
being the over the network and security

583
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
yeah that is something that is part of

584
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,799
my responsibilities

585
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,399
um and when we have a significant

586
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,799
incident uh involving um a student

587
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
um then usually what happens is i go and

588
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
have a

589
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
sit down conversation with the principal

590
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,840
we discuss what happened

591
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,240
identified kind of you know what the

592
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,080
what the issue was what what was the kid

593
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
really trying to do

594
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,439
we talked to the kid and just kind of

595
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
ask them and

596
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,200
and then and we treat it accordingly so

597
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,280
that we say you know the

598
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
the first part of the conversation is

599
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,399
hey let's not punish this kid

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,080
in any way if this was not malicious if

601
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,840
it was just curious and he was just

602
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,399
trying to figure something out or

603
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
or if he was responsibly disclosing

604
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,120
things

605
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,320
and i mean all those types of things we

606
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,039
want to encourage

607
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,039
um we don't want to we don't want to

608
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
discourage it by punishing them for

609
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,280
something that wasn't intentionally

610
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
malicious

611
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,120
now obviously we we've had kids that

612
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,240
have been malicious and intent

613
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,840
uh we've had kids selling grades and you

614
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
know all sorts of stuff like that and

615
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
those

616
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,400
those things you have to take

617
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,678
differently um but there's

618
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,559
also a great deal number of kids that

619
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,799
that are just just curious um they just

620
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,320
kind of want to figure things out

621
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,639
um which reminds me of myself a lot

622
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,678
um because i can tell you i broke lots

623
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,440
of things

624
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,080
uh when i was a kid and uh including

625
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,039
a vcr that never ever made it back

626
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,559
together

627
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:11,039
um so we've all been there

628
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,879
very much so um that's actually the

629
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,559
hardest things for me and i'll

630
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,799
and i've been trying so hard with my

631
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,080
kids is

632
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,879
i i don't want them to be like me in a

633
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,360
good way

634
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
i'm like you need to be your own person

635
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,639
and i watch them go down and do things

636
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
like i would do i'm like and i have to

637
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
just

638
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,799
sit on my hands and bite my tongue

639
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,840
because it's like

640
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,480
go do it go break it

641
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,360
and my favorite worst conversation i had

642
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,440
lately was

643
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,559
if you're going to do it at least clean

644
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
it up

645
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,480
so i don't find out about it

646
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,080
that's how i work with my wife

647
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,840
gotta clean up stuff before she catches

648
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,879
me if you're going to take something

649
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,199
and go around the rules

650
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,960
you got to do better so you don't get

651
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
caught

652
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,520
awkward awkward conversation to have

653
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,960
but in my opinion incredibly necessary

654
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
in all fronts of mentoring

655
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,440
all right that's a fine line in your

656
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
drawing right there really razor thin

657
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,799
but hey i respect it i mean you know

658
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
different different kids

659
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,080
different strokes for different folks

660
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,678
kinds of things i mean

661
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,360
there are so many different types of

662
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,840
people out there that that

663
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
can learn from the failure in fact i

664
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,240
think that's one of the things that

665
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,439
that's been really

666
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,240
hard in the last decade or so is is

667
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
trying to find somebody who's willing to

668
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,679
learn

669
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,080
by just doing it and failing at it over

670
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,760
and over and over and over again

671
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
i mean i i think i can speak for jeremy

672
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,240
and dave for sure and just say

673
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,120
uh a lot of the experience and things

674
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,080
that we've got

675
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,678
came from that trial and error i mean i

676
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
i didn't learn windows

677
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,000
back in the day from reading a manual or

678
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,080
going to some training class

679
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,600
but i knew that os inside and out i

680
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,520
could write memory register

681
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,039
changes and all kinds of things into

682
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,799
that thing because

683
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,640
i just messed around with it and found

684
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
some article somewhere

685
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
uh that talked about it or somebody of

686
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,439
mine had tried something and checked

687
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,240
this out

688
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,240
you know kind of thing but yeah

689
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,158
i share that story of you know how we

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
all learn to network

691
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,320
quake and doom you know what's an ip

692
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,918
address i literally threw in numbers

693
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,520
till something worked seriously

694
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,679
you know what when we started doing it

695
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
we played this old program maybe some of

696
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,039
you remember it's called descent

697
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
yeah it's like you fly around this

698
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,320
little spaceship and shoot the other guy

699
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,640
kind of thing we learned how to do ipx

700
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
addressing because that's all that game

701
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
would support

702
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,600
and ipx like what the heck is that but

703
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,158
we've gotta play together we gotta we

704
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,678
gotta

705
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,240
bridge this network and then come to

706
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,760
find out you could buy this ipx to ip

707
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,080
translator and encapsulator and things

708
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,520
so cool but yeah that's how we learn

709
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,199
networking and then it's like oh we want

710
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,240
to be able to do this from home well

711
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,679
we're not going to be on the same

712
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,320
network so how are we going to do this

713
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,679
that's right

714
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,240
okay yeah we got to use this thing

715
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,480
called the internet you know hamachi

716
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
and

717
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,719
do all yeah different things back then

718
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,760
right

719
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,360
now and now we have 100 million dollar

720
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,400
networks we work on

721
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,240
you know i think i have 10 million cloud

722
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,640
resources that we that we run for

723
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,919
security for who would have thought that

724
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
it would have come from

725
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,760
a silly game you know in our basements

726
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:49,520
but the fundamentals stay the same

727
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,679
yeah that's

728
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,799
cool come on keep going more topics

729
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,320
let's go

730
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,480
i'm doing great i'm enjoying this

731
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
conversation thoroughly like i i should

732
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,279
have said at the beginning this is meant

733
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,200
to be super loose and fun

734
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,120
there's good i'm not going to be that's

735
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,520
what you're going to get i know

736
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,879
i get thurman and and troy in a room i'm

737
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
surprised that uh

738
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,000
i haven't seen troy take a hit off his

739
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,760
due yet

740
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,279
uh i don't have one in front of me i ran

741
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,799
out today

742
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,919
i'm drinking my monster uh

743
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,559
in celebration of bryce coons that's

744
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,159
he's my secret friend i have never seen

745
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,039
bryce without a monster

746
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,440
um i love that time we actually we went

747
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,000
to

748
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,080
the storage unit and he drove and he had

749
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,799
like two extra monsters

750
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,439
redundancy dude h.a pear that's right

751
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,720
don't mess with him man that price is

752
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,559
literally

753
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,760
he may be the scariest guy i know like

754
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,840
yeah when he was working for three

755
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,919
letter agencies i was just afraid for

756
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,199
everybody else in the world

757
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,919
he was amazing i love him super awesome

758
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
guy

759
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,799
um so

760
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,199
as we are transitioning to be mentors

761
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,600
it's almost our mentors already

762
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
what should we strive to be to be able

763
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,879
to mentor

764
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
what have you found successful as a

765
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
mentor

766
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
in yourself we'll start with troy on

767
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,479
that one

768
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,240
oh me me me because he called not it

769
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
last time yeah i did yeah

770
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
but but actually i've got a good

771
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,720
response to this it's in fact

772
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,279
it's something that i've held uh true

773
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
for myself for a long long time and that

774
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,840
is

775
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,679
um i don't want to make this sound like

776
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,959
i'm tooting my own horn or anything

777
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,559
but here's the thing no

778
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,159
i've mentored a lot of people in

779
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,240
different ways i mean

780
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
when it comes to folks out there there's

781
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
a long list of people

782
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
that i've had interaction with and and

783
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,720
put onto this path

784
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,679
you know kelly guinnessy uh kevin howard

785
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,039
dave therm the list is long and

786
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,520
distinguished

787
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,279
but but but here's the thing they all

788
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,799
had one thing in common

789
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,120
and this is that thing that brings true

790
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,399
for me is they have to have

791
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,000
that spark of interest and it has to go

792
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,760
deeper than just

793
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
ah you know i've been thinking about

794
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,559
that you've got to see them

795
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,039
in the struggle at the moment wanting to

796
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,440
learn that thing however they can

797
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,120
and just failing miserably and that's

798
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,520
when you jump in

799
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,479
that's what you you find that desire to

800
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,600
learn

801
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,200
and you can teach anything with that and

802
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,158
so not only is that carried over in the

803
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
mentoring with

804
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,360
with different people that i've mentored

805
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,360
over the years but it carries through

806
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,760
with how i hire people in my

807
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,639
in the positions that i have uh that i'm

808
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,360
hiring for

809
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
i hire people more often based off of

810
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,719
that

811
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,480
thrive and determination than i do about

812
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
skill sets because you know what

813
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,840
i can teach them the skills but you

814
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,039
can't teach people drive and

815
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,120
determination

816
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,080
and so for me that is one of the most

817
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,199
important

818
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,320
attributes for a mentor to understand

819
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,919
is recognizing when they see that drive

820
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,360
and determination

821
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,080
and and just helping that person

822
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,039
out with that thing blowing their mind

823
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,039
for them it's

824
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,960
a mind blow for you it's just like yeah

825
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,520
i did that last tuesday you know

826
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,120
but for them it's it blows their mind

827
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,799
and then all of a sudden

828
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,239
that you've got them past this big

829
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,200
problem or this big issue that they're

830
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
dealing with

831
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,279
and man it's like a fish on a hook

832
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,840
they're ready to go and and to to learn

833
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,559
a lot of cool and interesting things and

834
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,480
very much so

835
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
change their lives i mean there's a lot

836
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
of folks out there

837
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,320
like dave who have gotten into this type

838
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,440
of thing

839
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,639
by accident kind of i mean how did we

840
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,919
meet and how did i mean

841
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
i don't even remember like i went down

842
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,559
to uvsc one day and i helped this kid

843
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,880
and

844
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,480
and he was like this really cocky little

845
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,559
bugger and oh i was bad

846
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,960
was trying to tell me how everything is

847
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,639
done and everything else and

848
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
i'm just like oh yeah okay yeah all

849
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,880
right sounds good i mean like you flex

850
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,840
those muscles baby

851
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,200
is such an idiot and but it's cool that

852
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,959
they realize that you know

853
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,200
months or years later like oh man i i

854
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
the phrase that i like to use is i don't

855
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
know i didn't even know then what i

856
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,760
didn't know

857
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
you know like there's so much to learn

858
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,679
that i didn't even know what i didn't

859
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,720
know

860
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,600
um but anyways it it's so much fun

861
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,200
to to do that for people and for me you

862
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,959
know one of the things about saint con

863
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,039
and just cut me off if i'm going too

864
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,159
long here but one of the things that i

865
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,240
love about senkon

866
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
the reason why we built it or why i

867
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
built it

868
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,360
and my most favorite thing is to go

869
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
downstairs

870
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,199
into that large arena and walk around

871
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,158
the lock picking table and i'll tell you

872
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,120
what when you see

873
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:49,360
somebody pick a lock for the first time

874
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,360
that is all of the satisfaction i need

875
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,959
to do this for another year

876
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,199
right because i was actually gonna bring

877
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,080
that up that's when they get it

878
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,000
that's that's when they're like holy cow

879
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,080
i just blew my own mind i did something

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,159
that i had no idea how to do

881
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,678
i did it in two minutes or ten hours

882
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,240
however long they spit they're doing

883
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,279
that

884
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
but to see that i don't know

885
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,799
exhilaration

886
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,719
in in their face that is amazing and

887
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,360
that's that's what mentoring should be

888
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
about

889
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,799
it's helping those people learn those

890
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,039
things and

891
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,960
and just fostering that that creativity

892
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
so anyways i've talked long enough yeah

893
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
somebody else taught me well so

894
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,239
going on with the lock pick i did that

895
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,200
work back when we all used to attend

896
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
work

897
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,440
um and i had it on my desk and i taught

898
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
just about everyone in the office who

899
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,039
was willing to try how to lockpick

900
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,519
and you watch that elation

901
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,240
of popping your first lock and they're

902
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,559
just like

903
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,480
whoa and then all of a sudden you watch

904
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
the next click though which is my

905
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,840
favorite part of that click where they

906
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:56,240
go oh that was easy

907
00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:00,000
yep oh

908
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,039
of yeah this sucks for uh for security

909
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,080
and then i just go like this and i'm

910
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,720
like would you like to talk about

911
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,720
something now

912
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
and it's true it's like that's that

913
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,760
moment is fantastic

914
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,439
um we're gonna i'm gonna ask therm that

915
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,879
question again a little bit different

916
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,799
but did you want to add anything to that

917
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,840
jar if not that's cool too no i

918
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,200
i think troy covered it and that that's

919
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,240
the beauty of all of this

920
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,799
is is seeing people actually get it the

921
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,960
vision

922
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,158
see that see the lights come on and they

923
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,559
go oh

924
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,559
i get it and now i understand it and

925
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
then the beauty beyond that is

926
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,360
once they once you catch them it's like

927
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,158
they're hooked

928
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,158
they they love it it's it's like drugs

929
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,919
compromising a box i'll tell you what

930
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,840
that gives you quite the rush

931
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,880
you know how would you know troy we've

932
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,879
never ever done that

933
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,158
well it's like i had a um

934
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,960
so my degree is information systems and

935
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,200
technology emphasis in security

936
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,800
and one of my professors his favorite

937
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,520
thing to do

938
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,040
um was he gave out four major

939
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
assignments and one was to learn about

940
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,639
encryption

941
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,319
and the other one was to play with an

942
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,200
actual virus

943
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,280
not just some script kitty stuff but go

944
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,279
get a virus and compromise a machine

945
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,520
and people were so standoffish of that

946
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,560
and they would just do the the the group

947
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,280
thing thing like

948
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
what one did you get working i tried

949
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
like

950
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,159
six or seven of them just trying to find

951
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,158
out the one i liked the best

952
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,839
and yet i did end up using the same that

953
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,679
a lot of people in the class used

954
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,918
because it was easy to demo yeah which

955
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,960
one was it don't keep it since expense

956
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,279
dude i can't remember anymore and

957
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,359
and while you're degree dropping i mean

958
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,920
can we all degree drop for a minute

959
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,920
be my guest

960
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,240
all right i just i'm just saying you

961
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,000
don't have to have it that's another

962
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,759
thing i think it's important

963
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,440
you don't have to have a degree in

964
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,800
computer information systems with an

965
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,280
emphasis on security

966
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,560
you know what this guy has a degree in

967
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,440
humanities

968
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,320
you know what dave has a degree in high

969
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
school

970
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,800
uh-huh didn't even go to college jeremy

971
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,960
what's your degree in

972
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
information technology with an emphasis

973
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,359
on security

974
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,359
nope so anyways

975
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,000
i guess what i'm saying is you can still

976
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,560
be great at technology

977
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,680
um it doesn't require that special

978
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,320
training

979
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,000
per se now these days it's important to

980
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
go get an education and to learn those

981
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,359
things i don't want to diminish that

982
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,720
at that at all please i'll caveat with

983
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,839
that it depends on what you want to do

984
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
with your career and it's hard for

985
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,560
anyone to talk about this and this is a

986
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,439
huge side track

987
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,839
i want to specifically to be able to

988
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,000
work with three-letter

989
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,599
agencies and you

990
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,520
at that point in time you have to be

991
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,359
able to have some form of formal

992
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,759
education to be able to do that

993
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,920
either as a civil servant or as a

994
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,440
contractor

995
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
now as a contractor you don't

996
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
necessarily need one

997
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,240
but you need 15 years of experience

998
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
to be able to get any kind of job to do

999
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,598
that

1000
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,598
so because that was my whole goal

1001
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,119
i wasn't trying to to uh well that's why

1002
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,560
i want people to understand too off that

1003
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,599
conversation i'm with you

1004
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,839
some of my some of the people i know who

1005
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,119
are so dang good at this

1006
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,560
don't have one college credit

1007
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,240
and you don't need a college grad to be

1008
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,040
a genius

1009
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,839
i will be the first one to to say go to

1010
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,079
college

1011
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
as a portion of learning but if you

1012
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,720
don't want to get a degree don't get a

1013
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,000
degree

1014
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,598
definitely don't go into that i mean

1015
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,119
i see like these people hundreds of

1016
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
thousands of dollars

1017
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,839
i was director of it for a college in in

1018
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,720
nashville that

1019
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,759
the kids were 120 000 in debt for arts

1020
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,919
degrees

1021
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,560
yep and it breaks my heart now looking

1022
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,800
back to how catastrophic that is for 10

1023
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,440
years

1024
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,040
but yeah i would definitely if you have

1025
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,240
a desire to learn

1026
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,040
on your own that's i would recommend

1027
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,959
that

1028
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,800
and then western governors my daughter's

1029
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,160
doing their cs program

1030
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,160
and i think she's two years done in like

1031
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,598
two months but that's all she does she

1032
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,118
wakes up she does college she wakes up

1033
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,200
does college every day

1034
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,040
and she's able to go through it faster

1035
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,799
because it's at your own pace

1036
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,119
so don't invest a lot of money in your

1037
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,119
education if you're going into i.t

1038
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
because everything you learn in college

1039
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,680
it's probably going to be old by the

1040
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,000
time you get out

1041
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,879
or not really practical to whatever

1042
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,720
organization you're

1043
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,160
working in well and that was one of my

1044
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,000
favorite things too like

1045
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,440
you talk about learning an operating

1046
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,040
system at that point in time

1047
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,119
when i went through school my linux

1048
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,079
experience was very minimal

1049
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:07,119
um but you learned always no

1050
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,880
i did that but i bought it myself i

1051
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,000
didn't learn in college

1052
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
hey it's 6 32-bit man i could give it a

1053
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,400
meg of conventional ram

1054
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,839
it's all right no matter where you go

1055
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,359
you'll always run into someone who just

1056
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,560
uh

1057
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,000
does the the pretend glasses push up and

1058
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
talk to you about how awesome linux is

1059
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,839
above everything else yeah i don't

1060
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,040
pretend

1061
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,040
glasses actually do sag same here

1062
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,520
but uh i was doing one and we're doing

1063
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,040
it on

1064
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,320
uh terminal server

1065
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,000
don't ask me what to do with it now

1066
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,839
because i don't need to anymore and i

1067
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
don't want to

1068
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,920
personal preference but

1069
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,599
they were talking about how to use

1070
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,880
terminal server and the basic thing was

1071
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,440
like oh how do you secure it and there

1072
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
was

1073
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
in the class was well you're going to

1074
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,078
switch the port and i

1075
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,279
i looked at the lab went through it i

1076
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,640
went over the teacher and said this is

1077
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,320
it

1078
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,440
you know he's like what do you mean i'm

1079
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,880
like you know terminal server does about

1080
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,599
90 times more than this really

1081
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,000
it's not just rdp'ing into the server

1082
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
it's

1083
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,320
there's a lot more to it and he's like

1084
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,400
can you show me

1085
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,240
like yeah absolutely and he called the

1086
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,920
whole class over

1087
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,879
and i'm not like tooting my horn or

1088
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,839
anything because this is very

1089
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
nerve-wracking

1090
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,599
because you know a lot of us are not

1091
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,119
exactly extroverted

1092
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,000
and you know and i'm like hey guys

1093
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,520
what's up like can you show everybody

1094
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
and he was very cool about it he wasn't

1095
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,640
down my throat about it

1096
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,320
he's like show me what's up show me what

1097
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,520
you can do i'm like okay and i went

1098
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,680
through it and did something i said here

1099
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,320
i'm gonna show you my work systems as

1100
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,919
well

1101
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,760
and you're welcome to look at it please

1102
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,280
turn around while i type my password all

1103
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,920
that fun stuff because people were just

1104
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,160
like

1105
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,079
like hawks right and so i showed him

1106
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,598
like we do this we set it up this way we

1107
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
do this type of things allows

1108
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,119
this and he's like i need to and because

1109
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
of that he's like my lab needs to

1110
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,920
increase you know

1111
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,520
and when it comes to you know you're

1112
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
trying to go through things as fast as

1113
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,920
you can

1114
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,680
i'm with therm um debt is bad when it

1115
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,680
comes to education

1116
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,319
but at the same time i love the fact

1117
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,440
that i have a four-year degree

1118
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,359
and i wouldn't change we're not going to

1119
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,480
hold it against you chris

1120
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,000
please do um but

1121
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,760
and i say that from the standpoint of

1122
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,720
the same thing that our hacker family is

1123
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,079
now

1124
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,879
the people who i s you know we stayed up

1125
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,960
late

1126
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
doing labs going through things running

1127
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,079
home labs letting people

1128
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,839
attach to my home lab because it was

1129
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,960
better than the schools

1130
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,160
um all those different things like those

1131
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,200
group projects

1132
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,040
they have become my support group and

1133
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,598
people that i have mentored myself as

1134
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
i've gone and done things

1135
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,280
and it's just like our group right now

1136
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,319
where i know i can count on

1137
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,240
you know thousands of people

1138
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,759
to help me out if i ever have a question

1139
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,520
or a need

1140
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,119
and if you haven't seen marv's twitter

1141
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,440
on that and one of the stone hallways

1142
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,160
about how marv got a job within a couple

1143
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,920
days

1144
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,078
just because he put it on twitter and

1145
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
his family of his connections right his

1146
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,560
network

1147
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,359
of people who love marv that was amazing

1148
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,520
story

1149
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,000
but again we're going to digress back to

1150
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,359
mentoring and after this

1151
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,880
is huge i remember when we started utah

1152
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,279
saint

1153
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,480
it was mainly troy was the security guy

1154
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,000
for uen

1155
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,599
and he was probably the only security

1156
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,319
guy in the state

1157
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,839
that had the security in his title and i

1158
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,000
was his little padawan learner

1159
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,279
and kind of when we started going around

1160
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,680
and did like

1161
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,800
the little tech things that you even had

1162
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
i can't know what they were called

1163
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
but like steering committee or something

1164
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,480
like that where we'd text summits that's

1165
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,598
what it was that was the precursor

1166
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,680
and we would kind of teach people

1167
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,680
security and

1168
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,759
saint became what we wanted we were

1169
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,319
really worried in the beginning

1170
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,079
but it was everybody helping everybody

1171
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,960
and we had a hard time getting speakers

1172
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,119
in the beginning

1173
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,240
but we were able to get some excitement

1174
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,920
and if you remember that

1175
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,680
and eventually we got more and more

1176
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,359
speakers um

1177
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,520
we still i think you guys still struggle

1178
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,598
getting new people speaking

1179
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,319
uh which is yeah i remember the days of

1180
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,520
coming up with 12 hours of content

1181
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,359
oh yeah sccp class you taught

1182
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
right you know that's a week's one three

1183
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,200
days of troy jessup god says yeah

1184
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:33,119
yep so therm here's the the question

1185
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,000
refactored for you a little bit now

1186
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,000
as the mentee i love that from 30 rock

1187
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,839
by the way if you've never watched that

1188
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
the mentee the one who's been mentored

1189
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,960
what is it that you found was the most

1190
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,040
important thing

1191
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,560
in your mentor like what was the most

1192
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,960
important thing that troy did

1193
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,078
or the quality that he had that helped

1194
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,119
you become

1195
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,560
and learn well the big thing is we're

1196
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,560
still in contact after 20 years um

1197
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,799
i still on occasion i'll reach out to

1198
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,480
troy about stuff

1199
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,160
we've kept that communication you know

1200
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,880
between the two of us

1201
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,200
when o days drop he'll call me and we'll

1202
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,480
vice versa we do some of that

1203
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,759
um but a lot of it was

1204
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,160
troy would give me assignments

1205
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,160
and just kind of let me go and then when

1206
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,359
i got stuck or whatever i would come

1207
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,839
back to him

1208
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,880
um i still i was gonna bring them i have

1209
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,799
them in my garage

1210
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,400
my notes so when troy would teach me

1211
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,319
stuff like vi

1212
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,079
and running x uh windows through an ssh

1213
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,520
port back to your machine

1214
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,119
so after you compromised the book it

1215
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,319
would the box would just

1216
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,680
sh point the shell back to you um i have

1217
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,279
all those notes

1218
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,879
i still do this day they're in a binder

1219
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,920
out in my garage

1220
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,000
uh the fact that he was just you know

1221
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,359
he he may not have had a plan but he had

1222
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
kind of a plan

1223
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,640
where it started off with basics of

1224
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,480
linux

1225
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,920
and then we moved on to more advanced

1226
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,960
stuff and then as a team

1227
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,480
we were able to uh use unsolicited pin

1228
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,640
tests and things

1229
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,160
and we're able to you know learn from

1230
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,560
that way uh

1231
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,279
my favorite is the unsolicited pin test

1232
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,400
but

1233
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,480
yeah do a little bit of that not much

1234
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,200
not much we would never do it now but

1235
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,680
our our server out of troy remembers we

1236
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,680
had a sun box that we would was our main

1237
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,040
box we'd do our test from and it was

1238
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,078
rape and pillage

1239
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,640
so it's r p box

1240
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,880
we did call it r p didn't we yep those

1241
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,279
are those are good days

1242
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,960
i learned a ton i still use that same

1243
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,880
knowledge to this day

1244
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,640
and i've tried to honestly adopt some of

1245
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
troy's you know

1246
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,000
give him a little bit of information get

1247
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,240
him started

1248
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,160
and then you know that back and forth

1249
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,759
and then teach him

1250
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,160
what did we teach you the first thing it

1251
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,040
was rtfm oh geez

1252
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,839
oh jfm yeah which has gotten so much

1253
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,920
better

1254
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,359
kids got so much more documentation than

1255
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
we ever had but listen

1256
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,720
actually you know so that's the way i

1257
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,599
was mentored too

1258
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,560
so i i've had my fair share of mentors

1259
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,319
as well and

1260
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,240
and i'm not sure that i've got their

1261
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,000
permission to share who they are

1262
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
uh but but one in particular the one

1263
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,160
that that i love the most and hate the

1264
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,640
most at the same time

1265
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,160
is the one that taught me what rtfm

1266
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,319
meant i actually had to go out and

1267
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,560
figure out what rtfm meant

1268
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,040
because that was his response to my like

1269
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,599
okay so how do you ssh with the port

1270
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,599
like this

1271
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,359
and the and tunneling the thing and

1272
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,720
everything else and he's like

1273
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,839
rtfm and i'm like what the heck is that

1274
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,160
like you do dash rtfm in this command

1275
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,480
line

1276
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,319
or whatever like it's like i'm like

1277
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,560
like what is going on he's just like

1278
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,000
rtfm dude rtfm

1279
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,759
and and he wouldn't teach me what

1280
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
he wouldn't tell me what it needed to be

1281
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,839
i had to go read it and learn it and

1282
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,599
and such and so dave got a little bit of

1283
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,119
that i mean i channeled my

1284
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,640
my other mentor into dave and rtfm was a

1285
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,640
an often response

1286
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,078
yup for those of you that don't know

1287
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,079
rtfm means read the freaking manual

1288
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,640
yeah it took me i think uh not even

1289
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,240
kidding like

1290
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,240
six months of hearing that to actually

1291
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,520
understand what that was i finally

1292
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,359
broke down and googled it and i'm like

1293
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,720
heck i interview now i did some

1294
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,480
interviews as you know

1295
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,720
this last couple weeks and then ask me

1296
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,079
questions i'm like i'd google it

1297
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,839
i don't i don't know how to configure an

1298
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,480
application and as you're off top of my

1299
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,160
head

1300
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,440
i will go ahead and google that but i

1301
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,759
appreciate you asking me how to do that

1302
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,480
and they gave you the job oh yeah they

1303
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,079
always do

1304
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,520
because you run into the guy that's like

1305
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,040
oh you know how to do that you don't

1306
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,200
want him on your team

1307
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,440
you want the guy that you know is gonna

1308
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,879
suffer a little bit

1309
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,400
and google it i mean and advanced google

1310
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,599
searches are something i use all the

1311
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,640
time as well

1312
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,800
to get the information i really need um

1313
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,040
this last team i worked on sap was the

1314
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,560
devsecops team

1315
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,400
which devsecops means 50 000 things

1316
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,400
but in our case we had a team of

1317
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,560
developers who started doing

1318
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,960
security and then we had a security guys

1319
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,680
which was me who started developing

1320
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,359
and the developers knew how to google

1321
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,720
like python stuff

1322
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,720
and they would give me the answer in

1323
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,399
like five seconds and i'd spend a whole

1324
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,520
day trying to google it

1325
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,880
um i think that with experience in a

1326
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,359
technology or field

1327
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,119
you get better at googling like that's

1328
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,240
all programmers do that was behind the

1329
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,119
curtain for me

1330
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,118
look you guys don't know what you're

1331
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,319
doing any better than i do they google

1332
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,440
it

1333
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,240
yeah well back in the early days

1334
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,119
googling it wasn't that easy you know

1335
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,118
like you had to

1336
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:56,640
dust off your netscape browser and

1337
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,839
and figure out dog pile or grass jeeves

1338
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,240
or

1339
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:05,440
oh yeah or just read the freaking manual

1340
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,479
yeah man pages imagine that

1341
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,480
nothing like an ssh or whatever man is a

1342
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,680
good one until you see the no man page

1343
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,800
exists and you start

1344
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,399
crying on the inside um i can't tell you

1345
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,280
how many times i had to

1346
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,079
solve a problem by finding either a man

1347
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,200
page or

1348
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,880
if that one didn't exist a book

1349
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,879
you know and and digging through the

1350
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,559
index of that book to try to figure out

1351
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,119
how to solve the problem

1352
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,440
um because uh we didn't have google

1353
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,119
yeah i did that as well even in early

1354
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,040
days of google because it didn't reach

1355
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,319
the ends of the earth right

1356
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,920
and that's something of course that we

1357
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,720
talked about that desire to learn and

1358
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,200
fix and

1359
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,879
find problems is i've bought way too

1360
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,598
many tech books

1361
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,559
trying to figure that crap out so i'm

1362
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,839
very grateful for

1363
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,480
most of it being on the internet um real

1364
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,480
quick

1365
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,200
one thing is with and i think that's one

1366
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,920
thing that that frustrates me

1367
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,480
when i see an individual who doesn't

1368
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,160
know

1369
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,640
what how to do what we're just talking

1370
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,319
about can't use google

1371
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,000
to solve a problem because i sit there

1372
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,200
and i go it is

1373
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,680
so easy to figure out your own problems

1374
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,839
these days and if you can't do that

1375
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,759
because quite frankly i i didn't have

1376
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,078
all these tools that you have now when i

1377
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,440
was

1378
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,760
learning this stuff um and

1379
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,720
and yet it's all available all you have

1380
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,480
to do is

1381
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,240
you know type in a query and click a

1382
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,119
button and and spend a little bit of

1383
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,399
time on it

1384
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,520
and so i think more than anything

1385
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,359
um that that ability to do that is so

1386
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,200
critical in this field

1387
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,440
because it's constantly changing it's

1388
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,078
constantly growing it's constantly

1389
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,920
evolving and we have to be able to solve

1390
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,680
problems on the fly

1391
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,200
and the only way to do that is to know

1392
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,598
how to solve problems

1393
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,118
yeah well to get us back into that

1394
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,520
mentor world

1395
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,040
problem solving like real honest to

1396
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,880
goodness problem solving

1397
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,480
is one of those key attributes of the

1398
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,520
mentor and the

1399
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,960
mentee is that what we're calling it i

1400
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,400
think so

1401
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,160
like being able to solve the problem

1402
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,240
that's why i t folks you know that's why

1403
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,240
google is such a valuable resource

1404
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
because yeah you know what there is way

1405
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,598
too much out there

1406
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,960
to learn and to understand to actually

1407
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,599
keep it all in your head there's just no

1408
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,720
way

1409
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,280
now understanding enough about something

1410
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,399
like how it works in general so that you

1411
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,040
can structure a

1412
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
a coherent query to get the result

1413
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,240
that's the important part

1414
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,160
you don't have to know every single

1415
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,959
attribute of a bgp

1416
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,680
uh statement or a you don't have to

1417
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,880
understand

1418
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,879
php down to the variable levels and

1419
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,119
arrays and stack arrays and all these

1420
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,440
other things that's what google's for

1421
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,599
but should you understand hey this is

1422
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,800
generally how php functions or

1423
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:58,079
hey this is generally how bgp works sure

1424
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,200
right another great mentee attribute is

1425
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,680
somebody who can solve their own

1426
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,680
problems

1427
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,839
rtf i have a question for you guys um so

1428
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,800
i've worked with

1429
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,000
like several like family members and

1430
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,319
friends

1431
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,319

1432
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,558
are the guys that you love

1433
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,800

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,319
making twenty thousand dollars a year

1435
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,400
or they're making thirty thousand they

1436

1438
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,000
it's so upsetting like i'm like hey guys

1439
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,440

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,599
i will go through this like if you guys

1442
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,480
looked at like a curriculum or anything

1443
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,480
like i talked to

1444
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,440
uh dana over at uh test out up in

1445
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,839
pleasant grove uh i want to say banana

1446
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,800
white that's not data white

1447
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,359
wrong um but yeah that's something i've

1448
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,960
been

1449
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,480
uh dana fellows that's the dude's name

1450
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,559
he used to work in

1451
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,599
uh k12 in illinois when i was living out

1452
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,680
there

1453
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,520
but i talked to him because he does like

1454
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,240
the test out programs and the education

1455
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,960
things

1456
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,399
have you guys had any success or tried

1457
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,960
mentoring

1458
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,680
that's why i said before the most

1459
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,880
important

1460
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:16,319
attribute in finding somebody to mentor

1461
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,000
is have them having that desire uh that

1462
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,800
drive and determination without

1463
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,680
that it is like beating your head up

1464
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,280
against a wall

1465
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,200
and so family members i've got the same

1466
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,200
thing i've got family members who

1467
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,040
i'm thinking man i got the aptitude for

1468
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,520
this i'm sure my brother could do it

1469
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,160
you know or my sister or or somebody

1470
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,079
else

1471
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,680
and you know it would be a kicking and

1472
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,760
screaming kind of dragon thing

1473
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,879
and if their hearts not in it if that's

1474
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,480
not what they're interested in

1475
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,920
they're not going to be successful well

1476
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,240
i can't say they wouldn't be successful

1477
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,400
but they're not going to achieve

1478
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,240
the same level and that's why you know

1479
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,520
in life it's important to make sure that

1480
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,879
you're focusing on the things that

1481
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,880
interest you the most and whether if

1482
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,960
that's security and i.t

1483
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,079
and solving those puzzles and figuring

1484
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,079
those kinds of things out

1485
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,800
that's great but there's a whole

1486
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,400
different genre of people out there that

1487
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,000
this is the furthest thing from where

1488
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,280
they want to be you know

1489
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
so each to their own but yeah to your

1490
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,839
question

1491
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,440
without that driving determination for

1492
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,558
that specific thing

1493
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,760
it's it's hard

1494
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:20,160
yeah i so i had a family member that

1495
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,280
um it was really hard because he came to

1496
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,279
me and said hey can you

1497
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:28,319
teach me how to

1498
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,640
do like css and things like that i'm

1499
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,160
like

1500
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,279
yeah i can do you want that

1501
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,240
and he said well i don't

1502
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,079
that's okay he said but the problem is

1503
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,598
i'm a graphic designer

1504
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,800
and no one wants to hire a graphic

1505
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,040
designer who can't do css

1506
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,960
this was years ago obviously because i

1507
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,920
dropped the word css

1508
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,359
um but that was that was the biggest

1509
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
thing i said if you're not willing to

1510
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,960
learn it

1511
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,880
and then try and branch into javascript

1512
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,760
because that was coming up and

1513
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,359
i said then i you should not waste the

1514
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,000
time

1515
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:08,078
and that was a hard conversation to have

1516
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,920
because that was my brother

1517
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,119
and at the same time it's been good he's

1518
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,960
respected me for that and he's

1519
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,839
appreciated it but it's really hard at

1520
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,680
that moment

1521
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,960
and that was mentoring of some kind

1522
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,520
right but it was not

1523
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,880
exactly what he wanted at that moment

1524
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,480
because he was having that

1525
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,240
hard time dead-end job and he knew

1526
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,160
other graphic designers were making a

1527
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,558
lot of money just graphic design i'm

1528
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,640
like i don't know what you want me to do

1529
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,119
i can't make people hire you for your

1530
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,118
graphic design capabilities

1531
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,960
i can't i can find you places that can

1532
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,520
get you front-end development work doing

1533
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,480
design

1534
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,920
as well as front end but that's where my

1535
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,200
limitations are at

1536
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,880
and i know people who'll be willing to

1537
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,720
teach you those things if you're willing

1538
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,640
to learn them

1539
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:56,959
um that desire is big big deal

1540
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,960
so with all that fun talk i want to know

1541
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,400
from a fun standpoint what we what's

1542
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,240
been one of your biggest

1543
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,960
challenges of mentoring this generation

1544
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,959
what generation are we talking about

1545
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,160
let's go with this immediate generation

1546
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,359
right now the next upcoming hacker

1547
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,480
oh man what's been the challenges that's

1548
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,160
the question what's been

1549
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,200
yeah what's been some of your challenges

1550
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:25,118
oh man i i i

1551
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,118
go ahead jeremy you take this one first

1552
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,240
uh i mean i've got an answer but i just

1553
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,599
don't want to sound too negative

1554
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,799
that's that's kind of the thing right no

1555
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,520
well i i was just saying a lot of them

1556
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:42,319
i i i've had lots of kids approach me

1557
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:46,480
say can you tell me

1558
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:49,599
and um and i said well

1559
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,520
it's not that simple there's a lot of

1560
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,119
things i can teach you how to do

1561
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,559
but let's start with you know this is

1562
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,000
have you ever done any programming

1563
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,839
before no i don't want to learn how to

1564
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,200
program

1565
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,160
i just want to know how to hack and it's

1566
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,279
just

1567
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,680
there's no easy path into this career um

1568
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,240
there's no easy path into this

1569
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,359
it starts with a little and then it's

1570
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,319
bit by bit

1571
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:17,359
you you start to figure it out and you

1572
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,240
can't just say

1573
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,040
it's not like you know something simple

1574
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,399
that you can just

1575
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,640
do it's a lot to chew off um

1576
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,440
and that's why at centcom we focus on

1577
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,799
things like

1578
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,960
the some of the simple things like

1579
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,720
picking a lock which is actually

1580
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,040
ridiculously simple um because it starts

1581
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,078
to

1582
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,040
to build that desire and that drive and

1583
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,240
they have some

1584
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,480
immediate respon immediate

1585
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,479
you know gratification it's it's it's a

1586
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,359
oh hey i can do this

1587
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,839
and it starts to build it and grow it um

1588
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,359
but

1589
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:56,720
but there's no easy way to just say

1590
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,480
hey teach me how to hack it it doesn't

1591
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,160
always work that way right

1592
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,240
well that's a great segue into my

1593
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,399
response maybe i'll be a little bit

1594
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,759
i don't know if this is a diplomatic way

1595
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,480
to put this but

1596
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,240
the current generation again not wanting

1597
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,160
to sound overly critical but

1598
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,520
man they've grown up with that instant

1599
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,200
gratification

1600
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,960
uh in a lot of different things social

1601
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,279
media and other these these other things

1602
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,000
have created this instant gratification

1603
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,760
instant

1604
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,200
i mean man we used to have to wait for

1605
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,200
games to be released you know

1606
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,200
but but right now you download it the

1607
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,799
week before the release date you know

1608
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,799
and and that's a little bit of a tangent

1609
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,480
to say we used to have to like work at

1610
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:39,359
these types of things

1611
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,079
uh but the this current generation they

1612
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,960
want it

1613
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,000
all at once they want it immediately and

1614
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,280
holistically

1615
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,119
and some of them actually have the

1616
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,760
aptitude and capabilities of

1617
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,400
doing it at that level and that's where

1618
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,599
you

1619
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,680
jeremy thurm chris myself and others

1620
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,359
all of us old-timers i mean you got to

1621
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,680
think of yourself as an old-timer now

1622
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,440
almost right but all of us old-timers

1623
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,118
we're going to be swept under the rug

1624
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,799
but but if you think back we're the ones

1625
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,079
blazing this trail and the people that

1626
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,480
are coming behind us

1627
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,359
are going to do amazing things because

1628
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,920
of that

1629
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,359
quick access to things but it comes with

1630
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,760
a caveat

1631
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,640
they don't learn that low level stuff

1632
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,440
that we

1633
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,000
worked on forever they don't know how to

1634
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,079
do

1635
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,920
memory register ad or they don't know

1636
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,720
how to address memory registers in a

1637
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
windows box

1638
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,759
they just know they can click a button

1639
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,760
and have it do something it's the whole

1640
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,280
script kitty mentality to a degree

1641
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,040
and that's not bad i mean you need

1642
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,280
script kitties you need people that can

1643
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,960
click a button and and take input and

1644
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,000
output and do things

1645
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,520
but the kids the the folks these days

1646
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,799
are not learning at that low level

1647
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,880
they're not understanding

1648
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,640
what i'm calling the fundamentals i mean

1649
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,920
one of the tea one of the classes that i

1650
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,160
love to teach at saint con

1651
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,040
is something sim as simple as ip

1652
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,440
fundamentals

1653
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,440
here's how an ip packet works like

1654
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,319
here's like literally we get down to the

1655
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,079
bits like

1656
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,440
little electric signal came through and

1657
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,119
that made it a one and

1658
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,960
there wasn't an electric signal here so

1659
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,400
that made it a zero and here's how it

1660
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,839
gets all put together and then here's

1661
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,280
how the computer reads it and

1662
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,119
here's how it gets interpreted and

1663
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,319
here's what this means and that means

1664
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,760
they're not learning those kinds of

1665
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,359
things i can't even get my kids

1666
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,599
interested in that kind of stuff

1667
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,680
man i pulled out the ip address or the

1668
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,240
tcp illustrated book one time you know

1669
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,000
that real

1670
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:25,919
thick book in their in their bookshelves

1671
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,680
right i'm like hey son let's

1672
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,040
blow the dust off of this thing and

1673
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,759
let's let's teach you about network

1674
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,599
because he's like

1675
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,040
hey listen i can't get i can't connect

1676
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,640
to my friend's switch

1677
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,880
i can't get my thing to work you know

1678
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,480
and i'm like what if the address is he

1679
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,119
on

1680
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,240
you know anyways the bottom line is uh

1681
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,920
i.t security

1682
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,240
i i think that the the lesson there is

1683
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,920
it all goes back to gaming somehow like

1684
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,279
we learned how to do ip addressing

1685
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,119
because that's what you needed to do to

1686
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,040
make that darn game work right

1687
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,720
but but really what it comes down to is

1688
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,319
things are so simple and easy now

1689
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,759
that they the the people are not having

1690
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,759
to learn those fundamentals

1691
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,000
and i think that we're seeing we're

1692
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,480
going to see a skip

1693
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,920
in that comprehension in our in that

1694
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,520
generation right now

1695
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,359
and it'll come back because it's going

1696
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,160
to have to you can't lose that

1697
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,920
but it might come back in a total change

1698
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,480
on how we do some of those fundamental

1699
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,720
things

1700
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,799
because it's a lost art nobody knows how

1701
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,000
to do ip networking anymore you know

1702
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,200
not that i'm predicting that ip

1703
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,720
networking is going to die but that's

1704
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,598
just the example

1705
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,118
but anyways not to sound overly critical

1706
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,559
i i just don't i think that they want

1707
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,079
too much too fast

1708
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,520
and they want it to just work and

1709
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,240
they're not willing to sometimes put in

1710
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,160
a lot of that

1711
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,000
deep hard work effort to figure it out

1712
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,240
lastly what i'll say again because i

1713
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,280
like to talk a lot i guess

1714
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,839
is i've seen that recently i mean the

1715
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,760
the current person that i would say is

1716
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,680
my closest mentee

1717
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,200
as it were i don't mentor people the

1718
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,000
same way as i used to i

1719
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,960
i'm too busy in these executive level

1720
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,880
jobs and

1721
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,319
and things like that to actually get

1722
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,200
into the into the

1723
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:02,319
nitty-gritty and mentor but there was

1724
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,839
this kid

1725
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:06,319
that i went out and met and it blew my

1726
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,000
mind

1727
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:12,558
how much drive determination and and

1728
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,559
potential that this kid showed and

1729
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,480
started kind of mentoring and

1730
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,160
pointing this kid in the right direction

1731
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,520
and one of the things that became a

1732
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,640
little bit disappointing i don't want to

1733
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,480
overstate it but

1734
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,480
a little bit disappointing is they were

1735
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,079
okay with just achieving a certain level

1736
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,119
and being done

1737
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,640
and not going further um

1738
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,119
why do people end up on the help desk

1739
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,799
and then never leave the help desk

1740
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,119
i've never understood that and the thing

1741
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,720
is no real harsh judgment there either

1742
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,880
for somebody who wants i mean

1743
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,399
for some people that is an amazing

1744
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,240
career and

1745
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,839
and they're more about customer service

1746
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,439
and so i don't want to judge but

1747
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:51,599
you see so much potential in people and

1748
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,880
and you see them kind of get somewhere

1749
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,000
and become comfortable with it and i

1750
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,359
think that's another problem with the

1751
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,200
current generation

1752
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,799
and one that if they can overcome some

1753
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,480
of those types of things

1754
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,920
they'll be amazing they're going to pass

1755
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,280
us by and we're just going to have tire

1756
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,079
tracks up our backs

1757
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,720
because there's some amazing people

1758
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,680
coming up the ranks

1759
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,959
i mean sorry think of this like these

1760
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,200
are the kids that

1761
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,200
are growing up like from first grade on

1762
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,118
that they know a computer just as well

1763
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,839
as we did when we were

1764
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,880
graduating high school or in college or

1765
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,400
whatever like

1766
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,920
they know how to type on a keyboard they

1767
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,559
know how to open up programs they know

1768
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,559
how to save

1769
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,480
things and how to move things and how to

1770
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,680
connect things and install programs and

1771
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,039
do all these things

1772
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,279
at in first grade like it's amazing

1773
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,480
like they're they're poised to do

1774
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,400
amazing things

1775
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,160
they just need to learn the fundamentals

1776
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,480
and sometimes we hide it from them

1777
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,240
jeremy in school and i hate that we have

1778
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,520
to lock all that stuff down because they

1779
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,720
don't ever get to see what's under that

1780
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,240
hood

1781
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,240
yeah there's more stuff under there

1782
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,400
as you said there's a complete time of

1783
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,000
schools government

1784
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:05,200
everyone just for a fun example gluing

1785
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,200
usb protectors in

1786
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,279
no when you talk about that too like

1787
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,879
that fundamental of

1788
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,559
everyone used to have to bring in usb

1789
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,799
thumb drives and

1790
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,079
for kids some of us were zip discs some

1791
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:20,370
of us were floppies

1792
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:24,319
zip dips i always zip this kid

1793
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:26,240
[Laughter]

1794
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:29,200
i've got a really great story about a

1795
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,640
zip disc somebody's floppies right but

1796
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,319
zip dis were amazing compared to

1797
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,000
floppies yeah but you put a whole

1798
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,960
hundred meg on those things man

1799
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,119
250 come on you got up to 250. because

1800
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,880
you're rich that's poor people

1801
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,559
no no that was actually gifted to me it

1802
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,359
was beautiful that's high school money

1803
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:48,640
to me man

1804
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:51,920
eight bucks zip disk was setting me back

1805
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,160
no since i uh i didn't grow up in utah

1806
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,760
but i did high school in utah and i did

1807
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,720
it in weber county

1808
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,680
which is where i omega was at and still

1809
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,558
technically is

1810
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,000
it's only this big now but um it was

1811
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,000
right there and so what'd they do to all

1812
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,079
the weber county schools

1813
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,599
all the refurbished zip drives you could

1814
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,640
you could think of just

1815
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,839
here you go you need a zip disc here's

1816
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,839
450 of them

1817
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,520
and so they would hand them out and i

1818
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,160
had stacks of them

1819
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,038
any color you wanted because that was

1820
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,839
cool

1821
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,839
that was that was cool um

1822
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,359
but yeah it's it was that there's the

1823
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,480
hardware side of it too because you were

1824
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,680
talking about this and i'm going to

1825
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,960
totally throw it on the fans real quick

1826
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,240
for you to think about later and we'll

1827
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,200
get right back to it

1828
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,200
but you talk about losing the

1829
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,520
fundamentals not just networking you

1830
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,000
talk about hardware layer

1831
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,119
from the first time it built a pc the

1832
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
first pc i ever messed with was an 8088

1833
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,599
the first one i ever built was a 486 the

1834
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,839
first one i tried to fix the board on

1835
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,400
was a commodore 64 because i want to

1836
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,720
play

1837
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,000
two player games and my com port 2 was

1838
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,359
broken

1839
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
um speaking of everything comes back to

1840
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,839
games

1841
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,520
it does it i mean the thing is the

1842
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,359
reason why people are building computers

1843
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,079
and learning how to do that is for what

1844
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:11,038
it's for gaming it always has been and

1845
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,240
i'm okay with that we've had this

1846
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,799
conversation a million times

1847
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,558
all we ever want to do is play games and

1848
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:19,119
that's what we learned how to do

1849
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
i mean how about modifying someone's

1850
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,240
cereal cracker to

1851
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,160
function better so you could get

1852
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,759
whatever key you wanted anyway

1853
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,160
um i never did that one

1854
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,400
um but yeah like you talk about

1855
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,078
fundamentals like hardware fundamentals

1856
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,319
the software is there because that's

1857
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,880
what the the drive has been in schools

1858
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,680
and i really look at it going our next

1859
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,640
layer

1860
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,919
and level of hacking honestly will come

1861
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,279
back to hardware

1862
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,760
and networking fundamentals because we

1863
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,319
hide that even building a computer now

1864
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,960
is so

1865
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,240
plug and play as it use before it used

1866
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,280
to be that it's

1867
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,279
anyone can do it

1868
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,520
anyone can build a computer if you just

1869
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,558
try

1870
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,240
and not that it was ever the super

1871
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,799
hardest in the world

1872
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,160
but back in the day you actually had to

1873
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,319
set your front side bus

1874
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,078
you actually had to match processors to

1875
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,319
specific boards

1876
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,160
not just the cpu type but you had to you

1877
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,599
only had like six interrupts that you

1878
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,200
could work with and you had to assign

1879
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,440
them appropriately

1880
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,799
you actually change your irqs to make

1881
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,079
your mouse work

1882
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,359
you had a lot of different things if you

1883
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,119
load the wrong driver you had to

1884
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:35,359
reinstall windows 95 and 98

1885
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,359
um

1886
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,759
those type of things and i that's that

1887
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:42,400
layer

1888
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,200
and you talked about the basics osi

1889
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,799
right

1890
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,640
you talk about those basics that

1891
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,319
physical layer

1892
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,759
that everything sits on is where it's

1893
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,279
going to be forgotten

1894
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,599
and that's where just anyway things are

1895
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,480
going to happen great question

1896
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,160
um so let's so we're going to do a quick

1897
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,960
pivot off of challenges because that's

1898
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,799
hard

1899
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,559
i have a hard time with that as well

1900
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:05,599
just even with my kids

1901
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,599
that i want it now mentality one of my

1902
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,359
favorite things is my previous

1903
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:13,920
uh office

1904
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:15,440
manager in charge of everyone basically

1905
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,119
she brought someone in to see what

1906
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,599
people's jobs were to see if she could

1907
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,559
it was her nephew right kids in his

1908
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,960
mid-20s

1909
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,559
early 20s like come talk to people and

1910
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,200
he came over and she's like so

1911
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,000
what would you describe to him what your

1912
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,279
job is i'm like

1913
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,079
i solve problems and she and me

1914
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,880
went no that is not what you do and i

1915
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,240
went

1916
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,799
i'm not being mean i love

1917
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,118
solving problems that's why i picked

1918
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:45,200
this job i like the challenge

1919
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,319
and i and i immediately told her like

1920
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,359
that's what we do

1921
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:52,880
do you not think that's what we do

1922
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:54,160
it calls it puzzles yeah puzzles

1923
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,400
it's puzzles it's probably a better way

1924
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,680
to put it but it's like you give me

1925
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,160
something that needs to be done we have

1926
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,520
to find a solution

1927
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,118
and one of the best things but it comes

1928
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,160
and it tells people for mentoring for

1929
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,680
jobs i said

1930
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,399
it doesn't matter how much you make find

1931
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:12,078
a job that lets you

1932
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,480
fix puzzles the way you want to fix them

1933
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:16,080
it gives you the liberty to at least

1934
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,920
voice your opinion and have those

1935
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,920
accepted some of the times

1936
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,279
um because if you can fix your problems

1937
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,520
the way you want to or the way your

1938
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:30,000
group wants to you'll be more fulfilled

1939
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:32,239
and that's just so much more fun

1940
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,920
right right so what are what are some of

1941
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,040
the successes you guys had recently in

1942
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,359
mentoring

1943
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,278
have you felt the successes or as you

1944
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,400
remember the successes

1945
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,400
that really helped out

1946
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,880
i watched three months i'm just like

1947
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:53,759
again i've reached out to people

1948
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,400
like cloud tends to be an easy way for

1949
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,000
people to get

1950
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:01,198
unreacted to it aws has released

1951
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,080
great curriculum gcp all these cloud

1952
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:05,278
providers have sweet certification

1953
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,318
programs they got

1954
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,080
free materials and i've had people to

1955
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,960
come to me asking me about getting into

1956
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,880
the system

1957
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,920
or into it and to me cloud is an easy

1958
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,480
on-ramp

1959
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,120
to get into just because available

1960
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,238
materials

1961
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,559
and the demand for people uh when i

1962
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,599
was looking for a job this last contract

1963
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,600
ending

1964
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,880
i got hit up a couple times a day by

1965
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,319
recruiters

1966
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,159
because they need people with that

1967
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,159
experience so

1968
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,599
i think if somebody were wanting to get

1969
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,920
into it

1970
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,359
and maybe start getting mentored cloud

1971
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,839
would be an easy way

1972
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,600
and then jumping into cloud security

1973
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,040
there's maybe five people at no cloud

1974
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,319
security in the world

1975
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:52,000
there is not many people and there's

1976
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:54,320
50 tools that do it um i did

1977
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,520
prisma cloud which is palo alto solution

1978
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,440
there's dome 9

1979
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,560
there's chef there's all these different

1980
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,400
tools

1981
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,800
that perform cloud security as well and

1982
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,679
if you become

1983
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,719
as a new person or want to be mentored

1984
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,960
on these fields

1985
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,640
these are great entry levels for people

1986
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,000
you'd have great success going into any

1987
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,760
one of these tools

1988
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,040
any of the clouds is good nobody really

1989
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,960
cares

1990
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,880
like i use terraform totally eliminates

1991
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,400
all the cause like my last job we had

1992
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,320
five plots that we use

1993
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,400
we were moving into yanzee cloud which

1994
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,120
is russian we already had alibaba

1995
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,360
footprint

1996
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,640
so we were everywhere and once we start

1997
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,239
using terraform

1998
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,760
i just wanna interview i'm just like hey

1999
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,678
guys i don't

2000
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,960
care what cloud i'm in i just terraform

2001
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,679
everything

2002
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,719
and i think that as a new intern bring

2003
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,159
somebody up

2004
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,000
on some of the new guys that we had on

2005
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,759
my last team pointing them in that

2006
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,040
direction these are easy tools lots of

2007
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,080
documentation

2008
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,640
rtfm i'll put a quick one in there

2009
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,880
before

2010
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,320
anyone else answers but juniper has

2011
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,800
thrown out like their whole free

2012
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,799
training suite right now online

2013
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,800
fantastic it's basically the same as a

2014
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,800
ccna and on

2015
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:09,040
it's own i love juniper man

2016
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,040
it's yeah a huge fan

2017
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,599
same here what about you troy you want

2018
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,880
to tell us a few successes

2019
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,520
successes with uh mentoring

2020
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,480
yeah maybe a successful strategy that

2021
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,000
you've had

2022
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:26,400
or or a successful

2023
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,800
i can't rtfm is a great strategy when

2024
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:32,080
you're mentoring

2025
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,640
um encourage them don't let them quit

2026
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,159
uh my mentor never let me quit in fact

2027
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,360
i'd get frustrated and i'd be like

2028
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:39,759
no if you're not gonna tell me i'm just

2029
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,799
gonna leave i'm done for the day you

2030
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,360
know

2031
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,080
um you know don't let them uh give up on

2032
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,239
themselves

2033
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,920
uh things like that strategies for

2034
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:52,000
success

2035
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,199
um or how do you quantify that i i don't

2036
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,320
know

2037
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:57,678
um you quantify it by looking back on

2038
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,719
those that you've mentored and

2039
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,960
and seeing how well they've done

2040
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,120
you know i i've had the honor and

2041
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,560
privilege over my career of mentoring a

2042
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,080
lot of people

2043
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,679
to one degree or another i mean there's

2044
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,920
some like dave here who

2045
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,600
who we literally like if if there was a

2046
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,560
mother hand putting him under his wing

2047
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,159
kind of thing

2048
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,600
that was probably akin to what was

2049
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,440
happening in that case

2050
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,360
and that's happened in more than one one

2051
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,960
case uh for some of the people that i've

2052
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,839
mentored over the years

2053
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,239
um but seeing that they finally get it

2054
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,159
and

2055
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,919
and that people are successful man

2056
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,920
that's an amazing feeling

2057
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,520
uh to go out there and and know that you

2058
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,239
know i've i i played

2059
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,920
at least a small part of of of getting

2060
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,799
dave where he's at and getting kelly

2061
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,159
where he's at

2062
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:45,760
and and and kevin howard where he's at

2063
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:48,080
and many more

2064
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,760
so i i don't know strategies on how to

2065
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,080
get there

2066
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,520
rtfm that's that's pretty much it make

2067
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,920
him learn it

2068
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,000
troy's is rtfm jer you got a successful

2069
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,920
strategy you can think of

2070
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,679
well i i can't think of anything beyond

2071
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,560
what's been mentioned other than one

2072
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,960
thing

2073
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,400
um and and that's been saintcon and

2074
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,840
that's a that's a tribute to

2075
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:13,280
troy um because quite frankly that

2076
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:18,159
has been uh the most successful

2077
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:20,960
uh mentoring uh

2078
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,799
thing that i i think i've ever seen um

2079
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,280
the changes that that has brought

2080
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,480
across the state and the region have

2081
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,759
been absolutely

2082
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,718
phenomenal uh and that is that is thanks

2083
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,960
to troy

2084
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,640
that was his small part like listen it's

2085
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,040
a group effort that that's not a

2086
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:39,840
that's not a troy mentorship that's a uh

2087
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:42,640
there's a lot of people involved in that

2088
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,600
yeah that is you that was your vision it

2089
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,880
was my vision

2090
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,480
but there's no way i could have

2091
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
accomplished that alone so it's great to

2092
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,280
have

2093
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,080
have folks like you that get involved

2094
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,000
and help out

2095
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,360
that's awesome and if if you know my

2096
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,719
story of how i got involved with st

2097
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,559
con and i'll just share that again that

2098
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,560
was the biggest reason

2099
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:03,600
that i wanted to do committee staff

2100
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,520
help volunteer for st con is

2101
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,040
the first year i went was the first year

2102
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,480
in provo

2103
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,560
and i have friends on the committee

2104
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,080
who never let me know about saying con

2105
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,840
which cracks me up

2106
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,840
but yeah luke went to school with luke

2107
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,800
talking to you luke

2108
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,760
and josh galvez worked with josh galvez

2109
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,960

2110
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,960
yeah talking to you josh

2111
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,639
i knew quite a few but it just made me

2112
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,400
laugh because of

2113
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,040
you know who we are and where we are in

2114
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,360

2115
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,880
i'm just

2116
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,719

2119
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,520
we as security geeks we're an

2120
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,640
introverted type of people

2121
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,239
like we we don't we're not

2122

2124
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,320
kind the same the the wonderful

2125
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:59,519
issues the good news the same

2126
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,400
the st con news right but uh yeah like

2127
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,000
it it doesn't surprise me that luke or

2128
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,519
josh or some of these other folks never

2129
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,840
told you about it

2130
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,360
but i also don't do any i don't know any

2131
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,000
social media i sign up for a twitter

2132
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,000
account because

2133
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,920
of saying con and so it doesn't help

2134
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,199
that i don't keep in contact with people

2135
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,880
but anyways to keep you on track you

2136
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,919
were telling us why you jumped back on

2137
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,159
my story but i went

2138
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,840
in the first year with the badges uh i

2139
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,440
wish i had my badges here their work

2140
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,640
um my it was a white board it had a

2141
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,000
little

2142
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:34,080
a little um a little led screen on

2143
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,480

uh some chips that i didn't know and of

2145
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,000
course there's a badge challenge

2146
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,199
involved

2147
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,560
with it and you're supposed to be able

2148

2290
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,638
those gateway drug things man you could

2291
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,678
do anything with the raspberry pi

2292
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:43,760
oh i don't know

2293
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,800
this is the one that i i had way too

2294
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,080
much fun with

2295
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,360
so i used this in school this little

2296
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:55,840
netbook i used it to run

2297
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:58,880
backtrack yeah that's what this pie does

2298
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,920
and so this guy's got no power this was

2299
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,880
their first attempt using windows seven

2300
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,639
strip down and so i i took my my

2301
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,840
eight-year-old and he's way into video

2302
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,920
games right now

2303
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,880
i said hey son i'm gonna load every

2304
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,400
video game

2305
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,840
on this box

2306
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,920
so you could play it on the screen and

2307
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,280
it'll go up through a ps1 on here

2308
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,040
because the video card just can't handle

2309
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,080
anything else

2310
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,920
and so we did that and i grabbed all my

2311
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,360
old ps3 controllers

2312
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,199
got it all hooked up and so i'm mike now

2313
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,639
there's a portable gaming system

2314
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:36,080
which pokemon do you want to play

2315
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,040
wait there's more than one just teasing

2316
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,679
just teasing

2317
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,120
never once in my life have i ever played

2318
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,360
a pokemon game just

2319
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:47,199
replacing actually no i can't say that i

2320
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:50,799
did play pokemon go when it was first

2321
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:52,239
thing i remember that yeah

2322
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,679
you could say you never played a pokemon

2323
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,519
game because that's not a real pokemon

2324
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,400
right

2325
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,760
i never played pokemon and the nintendos

2326
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,920
and the

2327
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,760
the gamecubes and all that other stuff

2328
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,159
if you're not an rpg fan you probably

2329
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,679

2330

2358
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,239

2359
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,679
just going off on

2360
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:16,080

2361
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,639
name

2362
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,639
at the time the keynote we were trying

2363
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,000
to get

2364
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,679
you remember like couple months ago

2365
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,880
we're trying to get her from microsoft

2366
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,440
oh yeah yeah i know who you're talking

2367
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,199
about

2368
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,799
it's always based on our name and so we

2369
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:32,080
dropped off and i was talking to dave

2370
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,239
for like 30 minutes after about

2371
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,199
how gaming changed when we were growing

2372
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:38,239
up

2373
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,678
from on like pc wise and my last name

2374
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,718
was like all right i got one last thing

2375
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,000
to leave you with dave and he's like

2376
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:45,280
what's that i'm like

2377
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,800
optical mice and he's like oh my gosh

2378
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,360
oh those are the enemies man who ever

2379
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:54,159
played

2380
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,159
who went from a ball to an optical mouse

2381
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,919
kept having to lift the mouse up and

2382
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,040
move it yes

2383
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,960
it was this yep well all the kids that

2384
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,960
used to steal the balls out of the mice

2385
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:11,599
those were really cool we have a whole

2386
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,600
drawer full of them

2387
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,719
my favorite thing to do is the people

2388
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:19,280
have the trackball on the thumb

2389
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,719
we would pull that out and get a piece

2390
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,800
of tape

2391
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,600
as clean as we could and we'd put it

2392
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,600
over the sensor

2393
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:30,239
because it would still work the scotch

2394
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,639
tape would let it go through but it

2395
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,959
would

2396
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,480
jump because it couldn't get a clear

2397
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,880
reading

2398
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,599
but you had to get a piece like that oh

2399
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,600
that's bad

2400
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,080
oh we've done so much worse than that

2401
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,440
but that's a video

2402
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,519
well that's that's why i say i want to

2403
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,199
do some war story videos yeah we do we

2404
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,679
need to we need to actually get together

2405
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,440
and

2406
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,679
talk about the things that we can't talk

2407
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,559
about and then we'll censor them

2408
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:57,679
appropriately

2409
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,880
and that'd been called well it's all

2410
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:00,560
past

2411
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,560
it's all been too long ago that doesn't

2412
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,520
matter anymore right getting pope to

2413
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,679

2414
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:11,040
he did in high school is amazing

2415
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:13,280
oh my gosh the the fact that he

2416
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,800

poor kid because he was a jerk to him

2423
