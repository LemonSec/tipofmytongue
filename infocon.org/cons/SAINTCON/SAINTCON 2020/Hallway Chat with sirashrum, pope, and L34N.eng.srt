1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
james pope or as i like to call him pope

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319

we're all just vanilla popes but yeah

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
that's that's a little fair and then we

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
got kevin howard

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,759

what's the word i want for this you're

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
kind of like the prince of saying khan

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,040
because you're just there helping the

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
royalty

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,440
prince of sync i like it i i am one of

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
the youngest of the originals so i'll

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,599
take

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
it not even kidding man like you're

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,399
you're right there

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
it's fantastic yeah thrown into it by

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
accident for sure but uh

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
definitely one of the young ones trying

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,039
to uh uh be that elite hacker

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,320
following around all of the the pros so

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,559
that was the avog i'll

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
say that no there was no that av didn't

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,919
exist it was

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
we think this will work plug it in nope

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,320
doesn't work okay just shout louder

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,080
and then uh when we brought in pope who

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
actually knew some stuff about av

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,320
then that's when we really got av but we

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,039
spent three months in my basement

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,320
what mostly what most people don't

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
realize though is the av

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
i dealt with was movie theater av they

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
were talking like

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,119
80 000 projectors and and

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
putting in you know thx certified

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,000
baffling and stuff like that and this

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
was like

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,799
just no no feedback

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
no feedback and we have with the

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,200
sweepers above right

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
and we have no budget and we need it all

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,920
just to work

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
do you have any equipment by the way do

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
you have any equipment and we did we

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
spent

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,960
forever in kevin's basement testing

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,559
testing testing testing

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,919
only to show up on site and have it blow

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
the hell up anyway when you hooked up a

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,920
macbook

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,798
yeah the the number of ways that we

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
tested

58
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
uh different variables in the basement

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
all came out working great

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
plug it in on site nothing like it all

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,079
just like what

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
yeah that sucked that was a bad thing

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,919
that was years ago man

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
it did force me however to get to know a

65
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,440
lot of people hooking up their av

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,599
because we were literally plugging it in

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,720
and i was praying every time like please

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,760
come on screen

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
please come on screen yep and then

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,440
halfway through and sometimes it would

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
yeah yeah exactly

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,959
well troy would trow troy's the known

73
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,079
for

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,200
nothing ever working on his machine

75
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
so he's pretty good i had a really bad

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,399
run with grifter

77
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
it was like two or three of his talks in

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
a row that av botched and i didn't get

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
his recording

80
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
i felt really pretty bad about that for

81
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,958
a while but we finally got a few at the

82
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,879
end

83
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
as i said what about with aaron thompson

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,640
and his uh

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
his vj laptop aaron and his beach so we

86
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,958
were pretty

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
early and aggressive at least in the

88
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,760
infosec world and i'm not going to say

89
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
the rest of the world of moving to

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
hdmi which was the cause of a lot of

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,640
issues with handshakes and other bull

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
crap but

93
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,440
we went to hdmi pretty quick as a

94
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
backbone which worked for

95
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,280
99.9 of the people but aaron toppins he

96
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,640
held out for

97
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,000
a decade longer than everybody else

98
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,200
i always had to bring in like my

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
personal vga scalar just to get them up

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,280
to

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,280
hdmi but thankfully his laptop finally

102
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
bit the bullet and he had to replace it

103
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,480
and you can't buy a vga laptop anymore

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,040
so that's awesome google usb

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,518
they all are usb now they're just pretty

106
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
much

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,720
dongle dongle life yeah

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,559
drives me crazy all right so this one's

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
just basically war stories which we

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
started

111
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,679
uh already and you got a saint common we

112
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,119
got st common war story for audio

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,159
visual and it's just for some of you who

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
don't know

115
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,000
uh with those in the committee every

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
night we would go to the hotel afterward

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,599
as of recent and we just chill at the

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,760
pool usually

119
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
usually ends up being the hot tub and we

120
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,399
just talk about what went well and

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,000
basically just

122
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,159
sit back and have a good chat and have

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,799
fun and we get something

124
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
to clarify it's the hot tub because it's

125
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,439
cold outside

126
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
correct usually it's not because we're

127
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,359
hanging out in the hot tub with a big

128
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,079
committee

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
yeah and also the moment you said that i

130
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
was thinking

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
those first few years of av we never

132
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,518
spent time hanging out with anybody else

133
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
we were just fixing problems till

134
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,960
three four in the morning back at eight

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
in the morning we didn't spend time

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,039
doing

137
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,280
anything it was just grime set up

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
you finish wrap whenever the venue kicks

139
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,080
you out or as late as you can stay

140
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
you're back at seven in the morning

141
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
trying to do it and that was like every

142
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
day and it was

143
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,479
grind yeah it was rough there was no hot

144
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,599
tub back in those days

145
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,240
it was just this is pretty recent i mean

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
last three

147
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
four years right that we've done the hot

148
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,199
tub con

149
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,039
or pool con yeah i mean back when it was

150
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
in st george there was no hot tub it was

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,199
after dark hang out and doing all kinds

152
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
of hackery

153
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,600
in after hours but no hot tub

154
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
sorry chris i didn't mean to wreck your

155
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
flow there oh stories but i was like av

156
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
used to super suck

157
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,320
no you're those are great war stories

158
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
people don't get to hear that or

159
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
the fact that my favorites when you you

160
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
told us

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
uh what splitters we were using you end

162
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
up finding out that it was using a

163
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,280
a chipset off a dell monitor yeah that's

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
the one that works

165
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,479
so if you ever want to go

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
um stream stuff to twitch that might

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
have hdmi handshake i was thinking how

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
to word that that didn't sound bad

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,479
you could pirate movies or other stuff

170
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
but if you want to stream like your ps

171
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,359
to

172
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,400
twitch uh there's whole forms of like

173
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,160
how to get around it

174
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
that i found and it was all about using

175
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
this this cheap chinese splitter off of

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,919
amazon that was like 20 bucks

177
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,440
and it recognizes as like a dell

178
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,359
monitor and it works great until

179
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,120
4k laptops came out and that kind of

180
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,919
screwed up a bunch of stuff and we had a

181
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
re-architect but yeah i mean it's that

182
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,719
or you can buy a really

183
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
expensive device that does the same

184
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,880
thing

185
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,679
yeah it's pretty awesome that that's the

186
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,960
hack it's literally a hacked monitor

187
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,520
chip onto that splitter

188
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
yeah it's pretty awesome works good i

189
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,159
mean that also broadcasts out to the

190
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
parking lot so

191
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
three letter agencies can spy on it but

192
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,758
whatever that's right still good

193
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
it's cheap

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
all right so i wanna the question i'm

195
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
gonna ask right now is i want you to

196
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
think back

197
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
totally back to high school and here's

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
the or even

199
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
you know before or after college

200
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
whatever so

201
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
i'm gonna ask a question i already know

202
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
the answer to because i want the story

203
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
from pope and i know kevin's probably

204
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,359
got some good stuff too but

205
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,039
hey pope have you ever done anything

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
that possibly would have gotten you

207
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,318
expelled or someone else expelled

208
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,520
uh we're just talking about infosec

209
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
related things right

210
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
yes please okay

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
what kind of a bread box did you just

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,319
open up all right

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
so i mentioned this a little bit in the

214
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
ama

215
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,758
but um there was a kid we were not

216
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
friends we

217
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
we fought all the time everything was a

218
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,880
back and forth

219
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,599
uh he did karate and i didn't so

220
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,039
i had to use other means such as my

221
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
intellect

222
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,719
but i just i mean it wasn't infosec or

223
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
hacking to me it was just

224
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
screw this kid right and we had a

225
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,599
windows domain

226
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,880
and we had computer lab and i realized

227
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,840
like all you would do to log

228
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,919
in was just a four digit pin that was it

229
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
you just put in a four digit pin it

230
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
would log you into a system

231
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
now of course that profile had to get

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
loaded and it took forever

233
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
on each computer but what i would do is

234
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
just hit sign in

235
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
put in a four digit pin sign out sign in

236
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,440
four digit pin and it was

237
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,599
alphabetical and numerical so

238
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
next digit up i'd start with a p it'd be

239
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,039
somebody else with a p p

240
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
p p p go to the next letter and i just

241
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
kept doing that

242
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,799
his his last letter of his name was

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
similar to mine until i found

244
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,080
his letter and his login

245
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
and then i proceeded to go to a very

246
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,758
oh i was smart enough to go to a

247
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,879
different computer

248
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,440
and got there early before other people

249
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:18,960
i logged in as him and i printed out

250
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,120
9999 of illicit sketchy picture to

251
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,758
that printer to that printer to that

252
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,599
printer to that printer to that printer

253
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
and then i logged out and went over to

254
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
my computer

255
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
and then the class was full at that

256
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,399
point and the meanwhile i'm sitting

257
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
there

258
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
i mean i'm not like a sweaty person but

259
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
like that printer's over there just in

260
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,399
the classrooms like

261
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,040
just banging out print jobs right

262
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
and the teacher finally gets up and it's

263
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
it's

264
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
almost two inches thick at this point

265
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,080
she gets up

266
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,439
looks at it kind of like a flipbook all

267
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
the same picture

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,880
and she's like and shuts off the printer

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,920
right

270
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
an older lady i feel bad um anyway

271
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,439
she turns it back on and of course she

272
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
doesn't understand the print spoolers

273
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
sitting somewhere else

274
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
so it just prints out again

275
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
shuts it off grabs all the papers leaves

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
the classroom

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
half hour later he gets called to the

278
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
office and he got suspended

279
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,160
i yeah i mean i never uh i never claimed

280
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
responsibility for that one

281
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
that's why we call you pope classic

282
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,519
i try to be a good person now and maybe

283
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
i shouldn't be saving these for my kids

284
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
but like

285
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
i wasn't i don't i'm not i'm not perfect

286
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,119
and i didn't always make the right

287
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,880
choices in life too

288
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,680
so oh that's that's fantastic that's a

289
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
great story

290
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
yeah anything i was gonna say side note

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,519
was that same pin was used for his

292
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,279
lunches as well it's how you got your

293
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,160
lunches and i might have stolen a lot of

294
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
his lunches

295
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
while he was suspended you ate free no

296
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,640
not even while he suspended

297
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,279
i would intentionally get there before

298
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,439
him

299
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,439
kevin to put in the code to get the

300
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
lunch to sit and watch him put in his

301
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,320
code because it wouldn't work

302
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,240
i mean oh man it wasn't just while he

303
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,320
was suspended and it was like

304
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
years years of stealing lunches

305
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
and just hearing him telling him like i

306
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920

311
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760

i mean how to lock it down actually at

338
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
that point you really couldn't uh so we

339
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
figured out you could send netsend

340
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,640
commands

341
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,200
to any machine uh to broadcast messages

342
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
and so once we discovered that we

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,120
started sending messages to each other

344
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,880
in class to communicate

345
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,079
uh just because we wanted to play on on

346
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,439
our games together and so we just say

347
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,079
hey i'm done with my

348
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,760
my assignment let's get on and uh then

349
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
we realized you could send it to

350
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
different classrooms

351
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
and so we started sending it to each of

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,880
the teacher computers

353
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,480
um and you know we did everything from

354
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,079
you've just got a virus please

355
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
you know shut down an unplugged machine

356
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,680
or you know please rip out the the hard

357
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
drive or whatever and

358
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
but one time we had said uh deleting

359
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
files

360
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
um and it popped up and uh a poor

361
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,399
teacher

362
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
freaked out because apparently she had

363
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,079
been having trouble before unplugged the

364
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,120
machine ran out of the classroom

365
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
and class was over before she got back

366
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,680
and so

367
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,279
so you did not service to your own class

368
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,479
but i mean ultimately they discovered

369
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
that we had been sending that send

370
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
commands

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,600
but they really weren't able to track it

372
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,638
to any particular user

373
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
um because we didn't really sign in as

374
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
our own users we were just all generic

375
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,040
users for those classrooms so

376
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
none of us ever got caught that's

377
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
awesome

378
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
it's awesome we we learned pretty

379
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
quickly that

380
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
uh so they tried locking us down and

381
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,360
this is actually a funny story i started

382
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,279
working at uen later and

383
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,880
i was mentioning this exact story to

384
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,720
somebody there his name is wes

385
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,639
ferguson and the funny thing was is

386
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
he was the blue team like i was

387
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,120
essentially in high school fighting

388
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,600
against wes

389
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,519
and then he was like my co-worker a

390
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
decade later it was or dude

391
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
it was just weird right but we we would

392
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,880
get on these computers and find

393
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
issues with them and then they would go

394
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,040
and lock that down and you'd find

395
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
something else and

396
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
it started just like you know we were

397
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
just pulling up nabster pirating stuff

398
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
right like

399
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,680
downloading all the musics all the rare

400
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,920
metallica stuff and

401
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,439
just just you know doing that because

402
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,079
school had a t1 connection that was

403
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,560
legit

404
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,560
back then and you know uen

405
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,160
and i didn't have that anywhere else so

406
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,399
we were just

407
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
yanking everything we could and you know

408
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
they'd lock those down and

409
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,599
we we figured out how to you know go

410
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,000
into browsers and edit proxies so that

411
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
way you

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
could circum like all these just dumb

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,399
stuff that i didn't think it was

414
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,319
infosec or hacking it was just like i'm

415
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
just gonna download music here

416
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,639
in this class while i'm working and alt

417
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,519
tab my way around it and

418
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,040
and we did we pirated a lot of music oh

419
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,920
you're blocking that domain okay what's

420
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,599
the ip address

421
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,000
okay done back then that's what it was

422
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
yeah yeah we would do something similar

423
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
uh

424
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,519
get all the the new cds that came out

425
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,199
and then burn them all the cd and sell

426
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,360
them

427
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,120
so i may or may not have made ten

428
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
dollars a pop on that range of against

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,399
the machines

430
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
album that came out that was the thing

431
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,800
is

432
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
we would never go to the i mean no to go

433
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,439
to the music stores right because we

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
just go download them all and then

435
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
no one wanted there to have their

436
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,079
parents take them every week so

437
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,560
you know 25 market value

438
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,279
here you go yeah good little side

439
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
business

440
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
and selling them before they even came

441
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,519
out i mean i probably that was the fun

442
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,519
thing was this

443
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
because some people were you could get a

444
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,000
lot of the cds before they had actually

445
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
hit the stores

446
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,480
yeah and so you were able to sell

447
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,600
premium content

448
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,000
uh before it even hit the stores

449
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
that was fun we also had a kid we were

450
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,959
in an html class

451
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,959
and uh after we'd be we'd be done

452
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,800
playing or done with the html

453
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
assignment we'd play runescape or

454
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,920
whatever

455
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,040
back when it was on a webinar web

456
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,319
interface because we always go to the

457
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,480
shockwave games and

458
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,279
play a bunch of those but was that the

459
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
frog in the blender

460
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
the hamster in the microwave yeah all

461
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
that stuff

462
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,319
exactly and uh we had netscape

463
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
on a lot of those machines and he had

464
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
written some i can't remember uh it was

465
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,120
like a for loop or something in the

466
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,199
url that would just launch hundreds of

467
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,560
tabs or windows would just keep popping

468
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
up locking up the machine

469
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,599
and so he'd come over hey let me show

470
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,959
you this and he'd do that and he'd lock

471
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
up everybody's machine

472
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
and the teacher would come back and then

473
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,719
they'd have to reboot all the machines

474
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,638
so

475
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
he never realized the teacher never knew

476
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,199
if we actually completed our assignment

477
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,680
so that sucked but i think i mentioned

478
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,479
this on my hallway chat with bryce but

479
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,560
we i just directly traverse to like last

480
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
semesters and copy their assignments and

481
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,119
pasted them into mine

482
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,599
for like this was like dreamweaver seven

483
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,959
stuff in junior high i never learned a

484
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,120
code very well and i think that was my

485
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,638
problem but the reason i did it

486
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,040
so i want to rehash that story but the

487
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,759
reason was is because once we were done

488
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,719
we could play

489
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,079
games on the computer and we would play

490
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,759
it was unreal tournament

491
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,160
lan edition and we would just play that

492
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,000
all day every day we'd finish the class

493
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
and we'd just be waiting for people

494
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
and they'd join in and just you know

495
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,479
kill them and

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,480
so much unreal tournament

497
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,800
i didn't get into a lot of the unreal

498
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
stuff

499
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
it just shows how young you guys are uh

500
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
it's great

501
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,959
but no ours was always quake that's what

502
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,320
we did

503
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,839
you actually had to enable your mouse

504
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
look which was amazing but that's a

505
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,320
different story all of its own

506

520
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,320
[Music]

521
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,679
did they catch on with the state no

522
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,360
it just sounds like you worked for the

523
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,880
nsa which is not not the case anyway

524
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,600
our department of the state which is

525
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,559
also fun um

526
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:50,480
so give us uh a fun troy ptsd story

527
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,000
i i think i i i grew up in a very large

528
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
family right and their family talks

529
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
about the

530
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
the older children of the younger

531
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
children family and i'm right in the

532
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,679
middle and i feel like it was all the

533
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
same

534
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
i do feel like we had two separate

535
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,320
troy's me and kevin

536
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,080
right like by the time that i'm dealing

537
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,678
with troy he's wearing

538
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,639
18 director hats doing 15 things

539
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,400
and troy was great if you needed time

540
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,480
with him you could get it i mean

541
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,720
he was just running operations and knock

542
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,760
and all sorts of other stuff on top of

543
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,919
security

544
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,360
and so you know you get some pointers

545
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,240
but a lot of time it was just

546
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
you know solve problems figure it out

547
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,320
but

548
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,918
troy was great i mean he you know

549
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,280
he would he would be really good at

550
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,559
saying here's something that i think

551
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,600
you would like go spend time and learn

552
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,280
that

553
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
but i think the part i didn't have was a

554
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,559
lot of that follow-up it was really just

555
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
up to me to go figure some of that out

556
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
and there was really no like have to

557
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
come present on it or other stuff

558
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,879
i've heard a few of kevin's but it was

559
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
more just like

560
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,559
yeah and some of those is literally like

561
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,159
the stuff i'm doing today he's like

562
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,160
have you ever played around with netflow

563
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,960
and i'm like no and he's like i think

564
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,400
you would like it

565
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
and so i played around with it a bit at

566
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,919
you again and now i play around with

567
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
netflow all the time like i

568
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
literally tell people you should be

569
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
doing east-west traffic netflow capture

570
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,840
and just stuff like that i mean mine

571
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,799
maybe less ptsd and more

572
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,799
like mentorship

573
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,039
i think sometimes ptsd comes in with

574
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,679
mentorship though

575
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,120
it's just good ways it's true in very

576
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
good ways because sometimes you don't

577
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
ever forget something because you do

578
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
that

579
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,360
how about you kevin i know you've got a

580
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,639
million and a half of these

581
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,280
i'm just trying to think of which ones

582
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
are appropriate

583
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,559
um yeah actually working for him i

584
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,959
didn't really have too much it was

585
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,440
there was always a because i worked at

586
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
the college in price and uh

587
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,720
met him through cincon and started

588
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
working saying khan

589
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,760
and then he's like yeah we really need

590
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
to teach you what networking is

591
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
and so that was nice but i remember they

592
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,399
did a pen test one time down at

593
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:01,039
uh college um and i remember

594
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
uh troy just he wanted to get on the

595
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
roof

596
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,439
of a lot of different places i'm like

597
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
what what floor he's like i'll just

598
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
figure it out and so that's when i

599
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,080
started realizing like troy just

600
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,679
like does weird stuff to just see if

601
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,080
it's possible and i was like this okay

602
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,760
this this mindset's kind of interesting

603
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,439
i was driving through vegas one time

604
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
randomly

605
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
and uh i got i called troy for something

606
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,000
or he called me and he's like what are

607
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,959

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159

612
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,918
and i show up and he's like all right

613
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360

614
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480

628
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,440
i'm like so what am i doing here he's

631
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
so he's like here put on this shirt and

632
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
at this time i didn't know

633
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,799
like what was even going on and this was

634
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,360
when school of root

635
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
had won ctf at defcon for so many years

636
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
that

637
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,000
they were asked to uh run the ctf side

638
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
of it but they wanted to do a little

639
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
spin on it so

640
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,039
they created this fake organization

641
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
called ddtech that didn't exist well i

642
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,320
mean they

643
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,720
they spun up fake websites and domains

644
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
and

645
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,480
everything else and so there was this

646
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
company branded dd tech that was

647
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,559
supposed to be running ctf

648
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,159
at defcon that no one knew about and so

649
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,678
what was happening was all of the

650
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
players were there early trying to

651
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,840
figure out who was running ctf

652
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,400
so when troy says put on this shirt i'm

653
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,158
getting followed around the riviera

654
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
not knowing that i'm being followed at

655
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,200
the time and people are trying to figure

656
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,960
out who i am where i'm going

657
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
i keep in mind my first year of defcon i

658
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
have no idea what's going on

659
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
and so i walk into the bathroom and

660
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,400
these two guys walk in next to me

661
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
and they're like so uh what do you do

662
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,559
who are you what are you here for and

663
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,039
i'm just like

664
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,280
playing dumb so they thought but i

665
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,640
really had no idea what was going on

666
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,918
and i go back and i'm like troy what

667
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
what the hell's going on and he just

668
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
starts

669
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
cracking up he's like all right let me

670
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,799
explain to you kind of what's going on

671
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
here

672
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
and he's like yeah people are probably

673
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
going to be following you around so you

674
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
might

675
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,440
want to take off the shirt and so he

676
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
just trolled me

677
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
like that's all he was doing was just

678
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,799
trolling me while making me run his

679
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,799
cables

680
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,240
somebody's gotta do layer one so i'm

681
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
just gonna run the kids

682
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,679
and then i ran the cables for saint and

683
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
then ctf the following three years and

684
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,200
then

685
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
just kept running cables black hat black

686
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,400
cat yep

687
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,000
yeah that's my that's my uh growing up

688
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
phase of 10 years of running cables

689
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,918
taking on every conference floor you

690
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,559
can't tape it weaver

691
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
because that'll rip up the floor so what

692
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,120
they told you

693
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,480
that's awesome uh there's there you

694
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
don't want to rip up the finish

695
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
salt pound some of the ballroom south

696
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
palace was worse they were so dumb about

697
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,199
it

698
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,918
like oh yeah gotta have it this type of

699
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,720
tape and then

700
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,440
stripe zebra on top and it can't be over

701
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
x height

702
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,960
then it was a mess it was just dumb

703
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,960
but i guess the summary of troy is

704
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,320
troy's a machine

705
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,520
right like i i feel like i'm i'm a

706
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,840
pretty good work ethic and i just

707
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,280
start on something and i just go until

708

713
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200

715

just goes just doesn't i don't know he

727
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
gets fixated on something and it i mean

728
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,400
saint kahn

729
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
is that the only reason it's here is

730
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
because of that

731
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,199
you went to his i got pictures of his

732
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,120
garage year after year of just

733
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,200
stuff floor-to-wall everywhere of just

734
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,799
everything all the middle stuff that's

735
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,679
not getting handled by anybody else he's

736
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,158
doing it

737
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
the guy's just a machine and so like you

738
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,799
just try to keep up and by

739
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,879
trying to keep up you become better

740
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,960
that's the crazy thing is just by even

741
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,200
going at ten percent of his pace

742
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
you're still outpacing almost everybody

743
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
around you

744
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,080
and and that's i mean doing following

745
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
him around for a decade

746
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
there's no wonder why so many people

747
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,439
have just excelled in their careers just

748
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,039
by being around him i mean

749
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,679
sancon's been around 20 years now almost

750
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,440
or whatever uh or utah saint and early

751
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
days security summits and all that stuff

752
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
but

753
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,279
the the community aspect of it has been

754
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
around

755
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,679
pretty much almost as long as troy has

756
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,080
been uh where he's where he's at

757
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,279
and i this this is 12 or 13th year for

758
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
me

759
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,400
and i think it was like that's the

760
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,399
original like one of the early

761
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,159
actual saint it wasn't saying con it was

762
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
a security summit back then

763
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,159
and so being around that that group you

764
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,080
know troy kelly

765
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,200
even nate and all those all those guys

766
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,439
just

767
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,320
they put you in a whole nother spectrum

768
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,080
of work ethic

769
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,360
yeah it's crazy nate's a good guy

770
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,439
most days and then he builds a thing

771
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,479
called the vault

772
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,520
the brainchild of kelly and nate i think

773
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,730
the brainchild of

774
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,879
kelly but implemented by nate and then

775
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,279
[Music]

776
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,400
uh i was one of the first participants

777
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,520
and uh

778
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,640
the nate's like yeah i'm not doing that

779
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,639
anymore so i had to take it over

780
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:46,879
and then now it's jc's and snows and

781
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,799

782
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
most awesome events that we do at st con

783
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,918
though honestly

784
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
it's so yeah when you think about that

785
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,559
crazy it's like the first

786
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,439
one was in a room and it had like luke's

787
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,678
window

788
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
yeah and a stand-up door and a pelican

789
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,480
case and now it's like

790
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,360
a four-room you know pressure plates

791
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760

okay yeah it's not a tool it's it's film

837
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
okay with the loop

838
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,199
you hook over and grab the handle and

839
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
yank it up right uh there's videos on

840
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,120
the internet we don't waste too much

841
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,479
time on that

842
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,918
but uh i just went over hooked it opened

843

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,559
at that time because i lost cell service

913
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,559
have never been in here before so i'm

914
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,880
wandering around

915
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,000
at the back of all of these offices

916
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,360
trying to find the it

917
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
office and talking to security guards

918
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
they're saying hey how's it going

919
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
i'm just trying to find my way around no

920
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,960
one questions me i don't have any badges

921
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,640
i don't have any

922
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,399
like clothes nothing i'm literally with

923
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
a backpack and

924
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,439
uh just walking around trying to find

925
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,640
this place

926
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,559
and stumble into a training room where

927
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
a lot of machines are logged in with

928
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,600
training users

929
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,600
and so okay naturally i'm like uh well

930
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,000
i'll come back to this later

931
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,639
um but i i sat down trying to wait for

932
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,520
the guy

933
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,159
and uh realized that the training users

934
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,039
actually had

935
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,600
access to the main domain and i was like

936
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,559
okay

937
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
so what can we get access to file shares

938
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,879
okay and so i'm just trying to poke

939
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,799
around

940
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,919
already and next thing you know i

941
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,720
realized that these

942
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,440
users actually have local admin on that

943
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,080
oh my gosh

944
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,919
so write that down go finally find the

945
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360
it office they're like yeah the

946
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,799
so kind of do your thing what are you

947
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
gonna do where are you gonna go and i'm

948
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,399
like well

949
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
i don't know you're like okay well just

950
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,879
all right meet us here if you have any

951
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,639
problems

952
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,480
okay sure i don't know what that means

953
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
like great so

954
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
go back into the testing room and find

955
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,279
out that uh

956
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,039
one of the admins had logged in as

957
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,679
domain admin on a number of machines

958
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,640
that this user had access to and so next

959
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,240
thing you know

960
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,080
you know mini cats and then uh

961
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
um at this time it wouldn't really have

962
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,720
bloodhound so you're manually

963
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,159
exporting a lot of that um but mapping

964
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
the whole domain you know it's not even

965
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,600
lunchtime yet

966
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,199
so literally domain admin by lunch and

967
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,080
i'm realizing okay now we got domain

968
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
admin

969
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,360
and you have to do the pull down the

970
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,559
groups manually because

971
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,000
like i said you had bloodhound at that

972
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,799
time and come to find out that

973
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,200
like this domain wasn't really one of

974
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,440
many

975
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:02,240
it was one of one and they had

976
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,519
uh hotel staff registration

977
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,559
uh cash cages pit boss

978
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,399
groups like the entire system

979
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,320
right in this single domain by lunch

980
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,918
so i'm supposed to be staying the night

981
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,960
and doing my pen test throughout the

982
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
evening and so i'm like screwed i'm

983
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,679
gonna go grab some food i've already

984
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,959
owned the organization i've got all the

985
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,120
passwords already

986
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,440
and so um because i mean mimi cast is

987
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,518
dropping them and clear text like crazy

988
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
and uh so i'm out there just eating and

989
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,720
drinking and whatnot and

990
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
just go right back to where i came out

991
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,080
the door right next to a security guard

992
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,320
who was watching the door

993
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,000
no questions go right back in and i'm

994
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
like it's amazing how just

995
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,360
the perception of you knowing where

996
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,120
you're going just gets you through so

997
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,279
much right and so uh long story short

998
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,879
many different areas i got into on the

999
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,840
back end so i'm staying the night

1000
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,320
plugging into the

1001
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,439
the wireless or the network in the

1002
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,360

systems and bone scans and things and

1011

i'm like well so i i start panicking i'm

1023
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,919
sweating

1024
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,518
i've got all of my gear all of the

1025
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,559
evidence in my backpack

1026
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,600
and uh they're like yeah we think we got

1027
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,360
attacked and i'm like

1028
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,199
did i hit that network no i stayed away

1029
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
from registration i stayed away from the

1030
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
ass 400

1031
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,559
and i'm like in full-on panic mode and

1032
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,679
so i go back to the it guy's office and

1033
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,200
i was like hey what's going on they're

1034
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,960
like yeah the server crashed

1035
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
like do you know why they're like yeah

1036
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,679
whatever memory capture it happens a lot

1037
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,399
we just got to reboot and get it back

1038
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,399
online

1039
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,080
i'm like so i had nothing to do with

1040
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,360
that and they're like nah you're good

1041
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,199
see you later i just walked right out

1042
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,479
but like when you're scanning you don't

1043
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,840
know you're going to kick anything over

1044
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,559
you go in full full-on panic mode and

1045
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,799
it's like

1046
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,839
then in retrospect i'm like well what if

1047
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,919
i would have kicked over

1048
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,759
the cash cages or the pit boss machines

1049
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,918
they're like holy cow like

1050
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,119
a random pen test that's not very well

1051
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,839
scoped right

1052
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,480
is scary and i had no get out of jail

1053
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,759
free card

1054
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,879
liability nightmare yeah so that was one

1055
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,919
of the earlier ones where i was like

1056
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,279
okay that's the last time that's

1057
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,799
happening

1058
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,159
what's funny is you telling that and i'm

1059
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,359
getting scared for you and you yeah

1060
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,679
you've already told us the end of it you

1061
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,279
know

1062
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
yeah that's why i started with i didn't

1063
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,040
get arrested good night man

1064
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,720
like i think at that point in time i

1065
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,399
just would put my hands up and

1066
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,678
when i had the credentials i would just

1067
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,159
put my hands up and walked over like

1068
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,599
guys

1069
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,280
this is what i have sorry i'm leaving

1070
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,000
but it was a lot it was a lot of fun i

1071
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,599
mean when you're solo like that and like

1072
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
we didn't even do any fizz sex stuff but

1073
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,440
getting domain admin by lunch that's

1074
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
always

1075
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,359
like everyone's dream right and once you

1076
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,480
do it enough you're like okay this is

1077
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,920
kind of getting boring let's find

1078
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,520
something more crazy but to do it in

1079
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,560
that environment where you're like

1080
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
this is the script right um yeah which

1081
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
is

1082
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,839
interesting even though you didn't do

1083
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,879
physics you did though i mean

1084
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,078
technically yeah

1085
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,079
and i didn't know it at the time right

1086
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,480
because like this is i didn't know a lot

1087
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,720
of

1088
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
fisek people and i i wasn't really well

1089
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
versed in that and like if i'm picking

1090
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,760
anything i'm screwed

1091
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
you know that's not me i'm you know

1092
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
network side

1093
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,680
yeah and uh but still just a couple of

1094
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,480
doors people don't care

1095
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,919
yeah and and that's always the typical

1096
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,320
you always find people who are happy to

1097
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,200
help

1098
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,640
more often than not yeah even though

1099
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,439
they have lavish ways of getting in

1100
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,879
right

1101
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,480

1109
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,000
you're like

1110
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
i never put myself in that situation and

1111
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,680
like you said like

1112
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
when you're a noob you don't really know

1113
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,118
what to do to protect yourself

1114
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
i mean even like after the guys broke

1115
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,160
into the courthouse

1116
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,839
uh and that that whole scenario and then

1117
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,359
all of a sudden everyone's like oh maybe

1118
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,160
we should have all of these clauses and

1119
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,560
extra checks

1120
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,000
and yeah yeah i mean you just until it

1121
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,359
happens you usually don't know

1122
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,920
right yeah so i only did i've only one

1123
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,000

1124
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,240
just normal stuff that i do for my own

1125
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,119
job right i've only done one for someone

1126
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,680

1127
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,960
it's never really been my thing i i

1128
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,598

1129
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
right

1130
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,720
and doing all that fun stuff and trying

1131
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,160
to break in and i did it for a senior

1132

1134
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,119
because

1135
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:47,839

the classic line and i said okay and i

1157
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,720

this right here

1160
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,920
my little netbook with two gigs of ram

1161
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,000
and i started doing some scans and doing

1162
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
all that fun stuff and

1163
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,119

1164
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,078
and i just it was one of those same

1165
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,760
things where i'm like i would like to

1166
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,800
show you all the information that i have

1167
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,640
and i'd like to stop

1168
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,160
now c w

1169
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,359
yeah i don't want this that's the hard

1170
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,759
part is when you start

1171
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,040
you know you have to extract the data to

1172
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,240
show evidence because

1173
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
there's been so many times where it's

1174
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,640
like yeah you really didn't get in here

1175
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,839
is a copy of the database

1176
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,520
like yes i did yeah and that's you

1177
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,520
you just reminded me you just reminded

1178
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,480
me of a deliverable we had once

1179
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,040
where we were turning in it was we got

1180
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,280
we got

1181
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,839
domain admin credentials through

1182
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
phishing

1183
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,520
and part of the deliverable we put up a

1184
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,839
website that was

1185
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,680
vote for the new website what it would

1186
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,040
look like a or b

1187
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,040
and it actually said thanks for your

1188
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,400
response gave back a pseudo random

1189
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
crappy number that actually showed other

1190
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,760
people voting

1191
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,119
so it didn't even like tear out and then

1192
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
so it just it forced them to put in

1193
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,280
their domain credentials right

1194
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,640
they log they log in and then it says

1195
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,079
here's the percent and then took them

1196
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,279
back to the home page

1197
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,240
so we got a lot and then we're doing the

1198
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,000
deliverable like

1199
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,720
well we got domain admin off of phishing

1200
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,200
right like the domain admin logged in

1201
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,078
with the domain admin credentials

1202
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,118
and i made some comment like well don't

1203
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,520
beat him up for it

1204
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,720
obviously you know that's not good you

1205
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,040
shouldn't be using those credentials we

1206
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,279
want

1207
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,240
all the steps but i said at least he's

1208
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,800
not this person

1209
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,919
like responsible for the website and

1210
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,800
picking new stuff

1211
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,200
and the whole room goes quiet and i'm

1212
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,839
like

1213
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,200
is he the person responsible for picking

1214
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,160
websites and they're like

1215
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,839
yeah and i'm like hold up maybe i don't

1216
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,440
understand

1217
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,960
if you were to be changing your website

1218
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
or doing it with a vendor

1219
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,240
you would be the person who would be

1220
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,000
approving that going out

1221
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,919
and they're like yeah and i'm like yeah

1222
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,320
man i'm all for not shaming users but

1223
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,680
like you messed up like that

1224
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,200
it's like bad it's really don't imagine

1225
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,879
what went through his mind like

1226
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,290
i didn't authorize this but i'll vote

1227
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,760
for it

1228
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,200
[Laughter]

1229
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,440
yeah oh that looks that looks better

1230
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,520
than our current one though

1231
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
yeah showing the evidence is hard it's

1232
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
uh

1233
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,640
like i don't like keeping data or copies

1234
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,560
of data especially sensitive data

1235
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,078
yeah so usually screenshot it scrub it

1236
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,000
whatever but uh

1237
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,680
sometimes you just gotta pull it down

1238
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,680
and uh

1239
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,078
gotta be careful with this one um there

1240
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,078
was a

1241
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,200
somewhat recent test in recent being

1242
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,720
years past few years

1243
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,520
where um we were testing an environment

1244
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,959
this was a team test event and there

1245
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,680
were some network ranges that were

1246
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,920
scoped out

1247
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,078
and we're talking slash 16s and we're

1248
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,200
like what and they're like yeah that's

1249
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,280
it's a different arm of the company the

1250
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,118
assessment doesn't scope this in it's

1251
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,400
not relevant i'm like okay great

1252
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,000
so we get into the assessment and we're

1253
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
seeing all of these calls to this other

1254
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,040
network

1255
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,400
you know random database calls and

1256
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,000
website calls and i'm like

1257
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,839
i have the credits to log into these

1258
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,359
databases

1259
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,279
but it's out of scope and it's right

1260
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,640
there and i know it's there and if i was

1261
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,200
a real attacker i'd just have that whole

1262
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,879
thing

1263
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,399
right like yeah no it's not part of the

1264
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,839
scope i'm like but you're cross

1265
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,960
like cross pollinating all these

1266
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,000
individual networks and they're like

1267
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
yeah we know

1268
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
so we documented it we just went about

1269
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,560
our business

1270
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,680
and i was going through and we're

1271
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,040
getting down to the end of the pen test

1272
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,000
where i start going through the lower

1273
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,440
posts that we're just like there's

1274
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,960
nothing really on these things i'm just

1275
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,400
scrolling deep into the weeds in the

1276
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,760
file system

1277
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
and i don't even remember what kind of

1278
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,800
machine it was but

1279
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,280
we came across some archive folders

1280
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,440
and these archive folders happen to be

1281
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,640
the archive backups of the database

1282
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,319
servers that i was not allowed to

1283
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,720
connect to

1284
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,480
on an old old system that hadn't been

1285
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,839
patched we'd like no one had even logged

1286
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,040
into this thing forever they actually

1287
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,240
didn't even remember it was like

1288
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,160
online they thought it had been

1289
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,200
decommissioned and scope i go

1290
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,118
cool what's in this database this is

1291
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,560
the largest uh sensitive information

1292
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,319
dump i've had access to

1293
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,759
in any given pen test and um

1294
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,520
i'm trying to figure out the best way to

1295
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,160
qualify there to quantify this but

1296
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,119
uh effectively it was every employee

1297
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,640
that had ever worked for the

1298
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,440
organization

1299
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,560
since its inception this was a very old

1300
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,400
company

1301
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,920
and it included socials salaries

1302
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,960
titles phone numbers uh

1303
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,319
home addresses um different positions in

1304
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,359
the organization throughout their their

1305
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,319
career

1306
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,839
like everything date of birth like

1307
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,640
middle initial like everything that you

1308
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,040
would need

1309
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,240
to completely steal their identity and

1310
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,520
know who was important in the

1311
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,040
organization

1312
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,720
and there were two hundred thousand

1313
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,520
records

1314
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,919
and so that was like okay well we don't

1315
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,680
want to touch this database

1316
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,599
and they're like well no you you need to

1317
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,118
show that you have access to it i'm like

1318
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,760
i don't even want to copy this thing off

1319
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,079
the machine

1320
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,280
yeah just no like go find it i'll point

1321
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,760
it to where it's at and they're like

1322
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
well

1323
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,119
we should probably put something in the

1324
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,480
report but yeah like if that's one of

1325
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,440
those situations where like

1326
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,160
that alone even though it's a like a

1327
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,040
loud pen

1328
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,720
test would it be classified as a breach

1329
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,759
because a third party entity has access

1330
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,680
to that data even though it's

1331
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,599
technically we're under nda and contract

1332
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,200
we shouldn't have access there's so many

1333
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,920
liabilities there that we just were like

1334
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,359
no no well

1335
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,440
i'll screenshot it and prove it to you

1336
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,960
but i'm not touching that thing

1337
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,079
and so that's one of those gray areas

1338
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,680
where you're like well you have to show

1339
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,440
evidence but at the same time

1340
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,040
that's the largest data set that i've

1341
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,000
had access to with that much sensitive

1342
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,279
information

1343
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,079
right yeah

1344
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,640
that's a that's a tough one that's just

1345
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,400
crazy

1346
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,839
that's the best word i have for that i

1347
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,040
thought of another deliverable one that

1348
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,240
was pretty well it wasn't quite the

1349
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,240
deliverable

1350
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,520
we a lot of times you have a customer

1351
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,479
sit in the engagement like i already

1352
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,040
explained

1353
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,200
this person was a highly privileged i.t

1354
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,040
person but not domain admin

1355
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,960
and they were the ones sitting in with

1356
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,920
us and

1357
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,760
we came across uh i think it was also

1358
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,079
fishing fishing is very effective if you

1359
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,079
pull

1360
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,520
if you pull the right strings right you

1361
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
you get the right triggers for those

1362
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,000
orgs

1363
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,680
or speak their language and it we got

1364
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,280
the guy the highly privileged person's

1365
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,319
credentials i.t

1366
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,280
privilege and it was in russian i

1367
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,000
believe

1368
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,880
we looked it up and it was like spring

1369
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,440
and the year

1370
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,440
right like spring 20 i don't know

1371
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,280
whatever year it was at the time

1372
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
and so i i kept doing like the russian

1373
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,640
translation to make sure i had it right

1374
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,560
and then he walked in the room and i

1375
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,598
said hey whatever your name is and i was

1376
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,640
like

1377
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,119
and i said his password in russian and

1378
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
he looks at me

1379
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,319
and we look at him like that was you

1380
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,279
he's like

1381
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,960
yeah oh man and then he's like i gotta

1382
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,200
go change my password

1383
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,800
and we're like yeah you probably should

1384
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,200
but don't do it yet

1385
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,079
so he leaned on your account yeah so he

1386
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,598
leaves

1387
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,839
and i'm like watch he's gonna change it

1388
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,440
to summer and so i looked at the

1389
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,040
translation for summer

1390
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,480
we didn't even get his new password yet

1391
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,960
or even try it but he walked in and i

1392
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,280
said

1393
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,000
russian for summer and the year and he's

1394
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,040
just like

1395
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,720
dead faced us like like

1396
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,720
like we're wizards like watching him

1397
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,799
over his shoulder and i'm like

1398
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
dude if your next one is fall i'm just

1399
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,280
i'm just gonna

1400
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,040
i'm gonna go flip it on your hair we had

1401
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,079
a similar one where we caught one of the

1402
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,119
admins and

1403
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,560
we're like yeah you probably want to go

1404
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,920
change this because it's actually quite

1405
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,440
exposed right now

1406
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,800
um but like wait till we're done and

1407
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,079
he's like no no we'll go do it right now

1408
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,119
like no no you don't understand we're

1409
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,800
still logged in

1410
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,480
to all of these systems as elevated

1411
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,520
permissions i'll just dump your new

1412
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,119
password

1413
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,880
no no it's fine it's fine all right

1414
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,400
whatever dumped his new password and i

1415
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,640
didn't tell him for the rest of the test

1416
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,400
right it's like whatever like

1417
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,759
yeah it's it's when i started doing

1418
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,599
consulting and i would

1419
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,720
get access to an administrator i would

1420
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,760
my go-to is always add a service account

1421
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,839
and i'd call it an av name e-s-e-t

1422
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,680
sophos something like that because

1423
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,400
everybody was scared to delete them i

1424
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,078
realized

1425
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,440
it was because one time i called it

1426
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,040
something stupid

1427
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,440
on one of our engagements they clearly

1428
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,000
saw it they tried blue teaming us

1429
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,359
and deleting it but in that same list

1430
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,440
when they were showing us had a whole

1431
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,839
bunch of avs and in my deliverable i'm

1432
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,880
like

1433
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,400
why do you have all these service

1434
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,880
accounts for these old avs and they're

1435
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,319
like

1436
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,760
well we're kind of scared to delete

1437
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,079
those because we don't know what might

1438
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,200
still

1439
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,119
may or may not be running out of them

1440
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,919
like when's the last time you used sofos

1441
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,119
and like

1442
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,640
five years ago when you're like so i

1443
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,359
just started calling them

1444
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,279
av names and service accounts and people

1445
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,880
look right at it

1446
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,480
even some people looked at the date

1447
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,079
creation and they're like it's recent

1448
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,839
like in the last week and they're like

1449
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,440
i'm still scared to delete it wow

1450
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,279
so i would i always tell people go look

1451
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,800
at your service accounts

1452
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,200
look for things like that because

1453
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,800
criminals aren't idiots either you know

1454
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,960
they're not going to call it they're not

1455
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,359
going to call it kevin super user every

1456
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,119
time

1457
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,839
so no my favorite is uh

1458
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,839
if a pen test is going on as a blue

1459
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
teamer

1460
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,759
ioc's as always is there a host on the

1461
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,680
network called cali

1462
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,599
if so you got a pen test going on or

1463
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,279
something as an attacker

1464
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,040
so i actually think i caught nate one

1465
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,880
time using cali

1466
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,319
nice uh he was doing a pen test

1467
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,599
somewhere and i'm like hey

1468
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,200
uh well that that login just happened

1469
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,839
from a cali host and then it's like wait

1470
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,078
let's just

1471
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,520
scan all the logs for cali oh now i know

1472
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,520
where he's going

1473
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,440
watching him go i think a lot of those

1474
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,640
situations you would just be happy to

1475
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,240
know a they're logging

1476
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,598
and b somebody's even looking and that's

1477
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,959
that's fair like right yeah and they're

1478
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,319
like wait you actually caught something

1479
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,680
i was like no i didn't catch anything i

1480
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,480
just searched for cali because i was

1481
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,040
you know having fun one time when i was

1482
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,920
at ceu i was actually this is right

1483
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,520
i think the first pen test we had like i

1484
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,960
got assigned a security role so like

1485
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,440
okay i guess i got to figure some stuff

1486
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,040
out

1487
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,880
the second pen desk we had i thought i

1488
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,119
was doing better

1489
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,319
um and so i'm like okay we're logging

1490
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,800
we're monitoring

1491
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,240
and i remember seeing some logs in in

1492
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,559
the domain controller

1493
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,000
or one of the servers that uh printers

1494
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,040
had been added

1495
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,119
uh to uh some some host or whatever

1496
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,880
and so i go storming in to kelly genesy

1497
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,880
and i'm like i just caught you

1498
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,960
installing printers and he just looks at

1499
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,960
me like what are you talking about

1500
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,720
not knowing at the time that when you

1501
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,079
logged into a remote machine and you had

1502
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,078
printer sharing enabled

1503
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,440
it would actually create a printer on

1504
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,520
the machine

1505
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
so all i had caught was him logging into

1506
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,240
the box not installing anything

1507
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,118
right printers printers were a lot of

1508
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,359
time

1509
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,720
uh they're a very effective avenue into

1510
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,078
organizations

1511
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,000
yeah they sometimes you can just unplug

1512
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,359
them plug in a raspberry pi or a laptop

1513
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,119
or whatever and you're automatically on

1514
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,880
some privileged magic network sometimes

1515
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,720
they have bridges through

1516
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,040
wi-fi and other ways to get in like

1517
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,480
printers printers are wild and

1518
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,400
organizations who think their

1519
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,359
segmentation is done just by changing

1520
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
the ip address

1521
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,640
even though they're on the same network

1522
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,480
like we had one like oh yeah they're all

1523
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,040
segmented everything's good and

1524
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,160
just change your ip address and i'm now

1525
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,359
on the privileged network and you're

1526
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,960
like well that's

1527
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,720
that's not called segmentation that's

1528
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,240
just yeah

1529
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,558
same l2 yes 20 24s

1530
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,078
well in the education space everything's

1531
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,160
a public ip anyway

1532
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
that's that's fair i was going to say

1533
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,680
that's you get a little more uh

1534
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,599
a little more luck with printers in in

1535
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,000
the state of utah

1536
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,280
just for that that was a lot of fun just

1537
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,880
going through showdown results for

1538
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,680
public ips in utah

1539
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,520
still is and i was like that's probably

1540
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,240
your main source of external ocean

1541
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,960
is i say pope do you still do all your

1542
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,879
personal printing up to usu now

1543
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,880
no usu is actually pretty good but there

1544
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,280
are cities in the state of utah

1545
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
that are not still and you can find them

1546
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,240
very easily

1547
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,680
they have rdp sessions open with names

1548
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,319
like treasurer

1549
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,720
and crap like that and they don't care

1550
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,279
they've been notified and

1551
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,720
i don't know yeah that was rdp open to

1552
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,160
the world is always a fun one no matter

1553
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,319
how many times you try and say shut it

1554
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,680
down and they say it

1555
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,279
we had one that someone had set up an

1556
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,879
already web gateway but didn't close

1557
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,680
down the main rdp port

1558
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,800
um to the internet so all users were

1559
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,279
going through the gateway

1560
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,920
but it was still accessible directly and

1561
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,599
russia

1562
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,119
some russian ip had actually brute

1563
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,319
forced the username and password

1564
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,720
because they had like a time clock

1565
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,800
system on there and it was defaults

1566
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,078
um so we're not really brute force but

1567
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,520
they hop in and they used to start

1568
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,000
spreading ransomware

1569
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,000
um not realizing that the box they had

1570
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,599
hopped on was the primary sql server for

1571
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,960
the whole organization

1572
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,480
they could have just taken over that

1573
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,920
thing screw ransomware they would just

1574
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,960
probably shut down the whole org that

1575
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,400
way but

1576
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,079
that's one of those like the attackers

1577
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,960
just are automated in such a way that

1578
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,880
they didn't even

1579
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,559
pay attention to what they had access to

1580
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,200
yeah it is absolutely

1581
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,000
a business and there is an roi to be had

1582
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,359
there

1583
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,680
they didn't even care about the sql

1584
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,598
server right

1585
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,520
moral of the story shut down your rdp

1586
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,040
well i mean especially now with

1587
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,040
xero login and some other things yeah i

1588
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,440
mean publicly available anything is

1589
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,359
not good you're just asking for it we

1590
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,839
had one that they

1591
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,680
they they changed the host name to help

1592
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,558
me i've been hacked

1593
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,078
and it was publicly available and we

1594
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,559
tried to work with him and notify

1595
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,000
him and nothing so we just black hold

1596
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,559
the address so it couldn't route to the

1597
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,680
internet

1598
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,760
yeah and then guess what they did

1599
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,720
they just reipped it just

1600
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,040
yeah that was when they were going

1601
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,520
through the modems and uh renaming them

1602
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,720
after they they they owned them yeah a

1603
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,480
lot of point-to-point

1604
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,799
a lot of ubiquity point-to-point stuff

1605
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,200
and just a mess man

1606
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,000
information security's just a mess we

1607
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,799
had a

1608
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,839
cold fusion server exposed one time it's

1609
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,440
working for an organization we'd

1610
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,279
inherited this server not knowing that

1611
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,720
we inherited the server but one of the

1612
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,280
acquisitions for the member comp

1613
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,279
companies uh had a whole data center

1614
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,480
um and it was data center was actually

1615
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,359
in utah or somewhere but uh cold fusion

1616
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,079
with the admin

1617
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,598
interface exposed and so i mean they

1618
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,240
there were so many exploits for that

1619
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,839
thing

1620
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,520
and we didn't have a chance to like

1621
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,680
fully bet out the uh

1622
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,319
the network as we inherited it a little

1623
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,680
while later we get a call from the fbi

1624
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,680
and we're like what are you guys calling

1625
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,359
us for they're like well um

1626
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,960
sorry to tell you this but your server's

1627
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,640
been hacked and we're like okay you know

1628
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,400
when by whom oh well um

1629
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,799
it's been hacked like multiple times for

1630
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,720
the past five years

1631
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
what yeah we're going to be on site in

1632
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,160
20 minutes and i'm like well where are

1633
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,760
you

1634
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,839
san francisco well you're calling me in

1635
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,640
utah so you should probably send your

1636
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,920
utah

1637
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,839
office because the server is in utah and

1638
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,839
ultimately what happened was many

1639
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,640
different organizations had popped that

1640
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,440
box

1641
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,279
and used it as an email proxy server to

1642
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,599
spam

1643
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,880
and they thought it was part of some of

1644
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,960
the opm

1645
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,400
breaches that had happened because the

1646
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,920
opm hack had happened through

1647
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,760
email and they were trying to trace it

1648
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,359
back and because one of the

1649
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,160
organizations that had compromised our

1650
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:42,400
box used us to send email spam to

1651
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,000
their servers then they actually were

1652
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,280
like okay yeah here we go we got it we

1653
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,559
want to take this we gave him all the

1654
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,400
images and i'm like well

1655
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,599
can you like tell us how many different

1656
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,960
people were

1657
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,720
accessing that and like actually we

1658
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,280
can't but

1659
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,319
uh just an fyi multiple over the past

1660
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,760
five years and i'm like

1661
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:02,800
okay thanks i mean at this point like

1662
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,000
who else wants access right it's the

1663
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,720
favorite server of

1664
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,839
go to email relay it was funny because

1665
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,439
when we were doing our forensics

1666
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,359
analysis on it we're like

1667
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,440
okay is this like three different people

1668
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,759
because like each was using a different

1669
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,599
method for for command control and like

1670
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,440
some had been dead and then others had

1671
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,040
like spun up subsites and

1672
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
it was just weird and then once we

1673
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,599
figured that out it was like okay that

1674
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,880
makes sense this is

1675
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:30,800
multiple layers of multiple years of of

1676
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,839
attackers taking over each other's c2

1677
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,079
right hvac systems

1678
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,000
that was always kind of like going go to

1679
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,839
because all the vendors just tell them

1680
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,800
to put it publicly available

1681
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,200
because they don't want to deal with

1682
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,800
vpns or other workarounds so there

1683
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,879
there's so many hvac systems that are

1684
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,640
just hanging out on the net

1685
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,319
and a lot that showdown don't pick up

1686
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,040
because of their they change the ports

1687
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,040
to hide it

1688
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,359
super sneaky that's right and map will

1689
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,720
never find it

1690
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,720
no no

1691
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,640
all right let's do a let's let's switch

1692
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,160
top that was great um

1693
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,759
i might have some nightmares for a

1694
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,000
little bit just because of a few of

1695
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,319
those

1696
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,400
stories but it's all good um

1697
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,079
let's see how about something crazy you

1698
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:24,480
did

1699
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:25,760
to be able to play a video game

1700
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,760
that might have been the story of my

1701
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,359
entire life growing up well yeah

1702
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,280
that's why i asked it most of us were

1703
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,839
that way especially from our generation

1704
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,000
and

1705
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,680
even before is we learned a lot of this

1706
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,319
stuff just so we could play video games

1707
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,759
right

1708
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,599
yeah i mean it started with my brother

1709
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,160
larry with magazines

1710
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,680
flipping through them writing out every

1711
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,319
code of every single thing and like

1712
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,279
basic

1713
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,000
and me trying to copy that right but

1714
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,839
then

1715
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,599
as we started playing more video games

1716
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,359
shareware crap that we never bought the

1717
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,119
final levels of we just played the first

1718
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,960
levels over and over and over

1719
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,799
as you start playing those and your

1720
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,599
parents realize you're not doing

1721
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,799
chores homework things it becomes starts

1722
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,079
become restrictive

1723
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,720
they start cutting down on hey you can't

1724
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,799
do that

1725
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,558
anymore right computers equals the same

1726
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,200
as tv you're spending too much time on

1727
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,400
it

1728
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,359
go do your chores or anything else

1729
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,920
and so there was levels of escalation of

1730
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,279
that

1731
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,280
from my my uncle was a

1732
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,920
computer administrator through a k-12

1733
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,440
and his job was securing the computers

1734
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,200
and so he would always give us their old

1735
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,799
computer and it always came with a whole

1736
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,078
bunch of freaking lockdowns

1737
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,440
because it was meant for school and

1738
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,319
we'd get these computers but they're

1739
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,520
just like you know dos

1740
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,359
30.31 whatever and they're just they're

1741
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,720
there's gooeys that are not gooeys i

1742
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,680
mean text gui

1743
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,118
yeah um like nine options word processor

1744
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,759
calculator whatever

1745
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,839
and you can't do anything else and i

1746
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,359
remember i was over at uh one of my

1747
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,960
larry one of his friends houses who was

1748
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,960
a little uh you know

1749
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,160
more nerdy had computers worked on

1750
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,520
computers

1751
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,078
and something happened to his computer

1752
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,040
and he's like oh i need a boot disk

1753
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,720
and he he put in a boot disk and got a

1754
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,839
command prompt

1755
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,240
and i was like wait what did you do he's

1756
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,520
like

1757
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,439
oh you put in the boot disk and it

1758
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,960
bypasses the os it just

1759
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,480
loads off this you know three by five

1760
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,520
floppy and i was like

1761
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,280
can i get a copy of this

1762
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,040
and i think he'd let's try to charge me

1763
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,839
for and i think i paid him like dollars

1764
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,839
for it

1765
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,599
and i got a copy of a boot disk because

1766
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,400
i didn't know how to get one

1767
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,520
and i come home put in the computer see

1768
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,720
colin

1769
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,599
alligator and i was like and i'm like

1770
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,959
run this and it's like put in disk and

1771
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,400
the game booted up and i was like

1772
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,290
hold on hold on hold on turn it all off

1773
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,079
cp copy the disk

1774
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,920
[Music]

1775
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,440
lift we had a drop ceiling when our and

1776
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,280
where the computer is at

1777
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,200
lift up the drop ceiling and threw one

1778
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,000
up there as a spare

1779
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,359
and and then because eventually i know

1780
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,200
my disc is gonna get caught

1781
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,558
already thinking ahead and it did and

1782
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,240
the parents would snap them in half and

1783
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,680
cramp like that

1784
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,720
bypass those the next escalation was we

1785
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,000
got a computer

1786
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,200
386 46 i want to say that had a tumbler

1787
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,720
lock on it

1788
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,799
and at the time i don't know who jimmy

1789
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,160
longs is i don't know you can chew on a

1790
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:19,200
big pen and shove it in there

1791
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,720
i know none of these things

1792
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,078
and all i know is i go to hit the power

1793
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,040
button on the computer and it won't turn

1794
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,000
on

1795
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,720
it's just a physical lock on off to

1796
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,760
trigger the

1797
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,040
power button and i'm just like

1798
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,799
i remember i'd come back a few hours

1799
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,279
later

1800
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,720
come back a few days later and then at

1801
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,319
one point i just got desperate

1802
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,439
at those days the monitor sat on top of

1803
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,640
the computer type of thing with the

1804
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,119
turbo button

1805
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,400
that made it go slower anyway i took the

1806
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,040
monitor off

1807
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,880
and i'm like i got to open this thing up

1808
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,040
and i started too but i got scared came

1809
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,559
back another day

1810
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,040
slid it off looking in there there's

1811
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:58,079
just two teeny little wires

1812
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,799
for that key and i'm like i'm gonna jump

1813
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,640
that

1814
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,880
and i i don't know i probably had ten

1815
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,520
maybe nine or ten

1816
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,960
and i jump it and the computer turns on

1817
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,359
slide the camera over put the

1818
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,799
thing on start playing video games um so

1819
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,558
it's just always like this

1820
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,079
i if my parents just probably let me

1821
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,280
play computer i don't think i would have

1822
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,720
done those things

1823
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,400
so i don't know if that's good or bad i

1824
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,558
don't know the answer but

1825
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:25,119
i'm sure kev has some stories there too

1826
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,160
yeah i remember we we uh went into a

1827
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,799
community center

1828
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,078
uh for our apartment complex and you

1829
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,920
know they had the the

1830
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,520
computer with the games that they had

1831
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,960
pre-loaded organ trail

1832
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,799
whatever all that stuff and we took in

1833
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,040
22 floppy disks of command and conquer

1834
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:41,920
95 and installed it on there

1835
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,359
because hours and they they didn't know

1836
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,960
but when they found out they kicked us

1837
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,400
out and we weren't allowed back in there

1838
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,240
even though my mother was the apartment

1839
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,319
complex manager

1840
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,479
so that was that was brutal but i do

1841
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,240
remember uh

1842
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,400
i wouldn't say this was a way for me to

1843
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,359
play video games per se but the dream

1844
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,280
cast

1845
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,839
uh not too many people know what that is

1846
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,839
actually had crazy taxi

1847
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:08,240
a phone line that's right

1848
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:10,240
so when i wasn't allowed on the computer

1849
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,078
for the internet

1850
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,919
i would hook up my dreamcast to the

1851
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,079
phone line and could there was a web

1852
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,920
browser that you could actually browse

1853
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,160
to the web websites uh on the dreamcast

1854
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,720
so i had a 50-foot phone line

1855
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,598
going into my bedroom uh so i could

1856
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,279
browse the internet

1857
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,680
on my dreamcast even when i got kicked

1858
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,319
off the computer

1859
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,000
that was fun i think my first email was

1860
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,440
a juno address

1861
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,280
and it's because they offered free

1862
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,680
internet but you they had

1863
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,319
caps like you had only so much transfer

1864
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,480
up or down

1865
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,079
yeah and so then we started spinning up

1866
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,960
more addresses i think at one point i

1867
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,640
had like eight juno logins to just do it

1868
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,480
and this was like an escalation for

1869
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,160
years of my life between

1870
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,839
i mean you tried the aol thing but they

1871
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,118
quickly burned you on credit card crap

1872
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,680
so we ditched that but it was always

1873
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,599
like juno and net zero and

1874
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,118
and getting things that moved and

1875
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,240
created pings to show that you were

1876
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,240
still using the internet so it wouldn't

1877
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,919
drop it things to get rid of ads so they

1878
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,919
would just keep letting you

1879
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,040
you know instead of popping up ads in

1880
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,000
the middle of your games while i was

1881
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,240
downloading

1882
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,839
music in the background and i mean a lot

1883
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,160
of this i stole from my older brother

1884
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:19,920
larry we went in together

1885
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:23,520
and bought a computer like rc willie's

1886
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,680
sony vaio two grand computer oh man

1887
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,280
paid you know tried to like share it

1888
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,279
down the middle of course it was in his

1889
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,359
room and he got all the time on it but

1890
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,760
because that's what older brothers do

1891
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,598
but he did teach me a lot of like

1892
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,359
here's how we can get free internet and

1893
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,640
pirate stuff and i learned a lot from

1894
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,078
that

1895
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,078
and then i learned about cookies and

1896
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,079
internet and all these sites had trails

1897
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,920
with everything and you can go edit

1898
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,599
cookies and stay logged into stuff and

1899
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,400
just i don't know just

1900
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,520
a lot of it was video games i mean

1901
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,040
circumventing and not

1902
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,440
you know being poor and not being able

1903
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,480
to pay for stuff too so

1904
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,160
one of my favorite uh kid hacks

1905
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,880
uh was actually from our late friend

1906
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,879
decaf he had set up a

1907
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,640
a monitor on his phone line that when

1908
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,000
his parents picked up the phone it would

1909
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,920
disconnect him from the internet so they

1910
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,960
wouldn't know it was on the internet oh

1911
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,880
my gosh

1912
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,480
yeah that was a clever one i liked that

1913
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,720
one a lot didn't worry

1914
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,240
do you guys ever have like godzilla it

1915
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,319
was like the first thing that let you

1916
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,359
resume your downloads it was amazing

1917
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:26,480
yeah cause before that everything

1918
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:28,960
stopped gone yep yep

1919
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,920
reconnect re-download and then you would

1920
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,599
continue download

1921
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,760
it had an audio sound that sounded like

1922
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,760
godzilla roaring when it finished

1923
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,800
yeah yeah and so you just go in another

1924
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,919
room and you hear

1925
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,919
[Music]

1926
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,240
yes i'm getting messages yeah

1927
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:53,839
yeah icq yeah aol

1928
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,759
imessenger in semester it's a message

1929
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:58,160
now my desperation was like when the

1930
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,599
first warcraft came out

1931
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,839
um and that was back in the days of

1932
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,160
how to stop software privacy was having

1933
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,440
to own a massive manual that had so

1934
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,359
little to do with the game but they

1935
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,960
would have you

1936
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,400
look up a word on page 70 on the third

1937
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,680
paragraph you had to put it in

1938
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,440
and they would tell you it starts with

1939
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,440
this

1940
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,720
and so i remember they're sitting there

1941
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,079
because we didn't want to buy the game

1942
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,879
because it was like a 40

1943
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,079
game you know but warcraft was dope i

1944
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,079
played so much work

1945
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,000
oh and i'm sitting there like i'm just

1946
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,079
like i've got to figure it out

1947
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and this is like you know pre

1948
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,559
pre-massive internet days right this is

1949
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,240
like

1950
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,240
and i'm like i just kept typing and

1951
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,558
typing and trying and i tried for an

1952
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,680
hour and i finally got one and it was

1953
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,880

and when it installed i about lost it i

1955
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,640
remember like

1956
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,598
literally crying out of joy because i

1957
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,240

01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,799

1984
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,480
really good uh

1985
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,799
a really good outlook on it and that

1986
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,160
changed rapidly and so was mine uh about

1987
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,920
piracy but at first he

1988
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,279
like was specific with music because you

1989
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,920

2003
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,200
like it's just like hitting record on a

2004
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,078
tape when you're listening to the radio

2005

2007
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,720
hitting record

2008
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,279
on the radio

2009
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,879
except for i get the songs i want and i

2010
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,359
don't have to listen to djs

2013
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,800
i screw those artists out of their money

2014
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,160
especially metallica

2015
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,880
[Applause]

2016
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,680
i did like metallica though but yeah

2017
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,799
that was

2018
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,000
well the funny thing is as soon as they

2019
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,119
did that of course it went

2020
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,960
up right as soon as they started

2021
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,280
complaining and whining about all that

2022
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,039
and we got the metallic cops

2023
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,480
flash cartoon and all that fun stuff

2024
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,079
that came out and their downloads went

2025
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,640
through the roof

2026
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,960
we seeded a lot of stuff out of that

2027
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,598
high school t1 connection

2028
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,160
they were absolutely said that i was

2029
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,160
like uh

2030
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,000
t1 that's legit crap now it's like

2031
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,399
that's so slow why can't i even touch

2032
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,079
that

2033
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,240
mine was all rom roms downloads

2034
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,440
i think midis i used to get really big

2035
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,118
into midis

2036
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,960
yeah and because we would put them in a

2037
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,079
programmer keyboards and like

2038
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,200
oh yeah anyway but midis that was a jam

2039
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,440
for a minute

2040
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,480
yeah i used to whatever computer i could

2041
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,480
get on because

2042
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,160
i'm the youngest and i always had to

2043
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,559
follow my mom around right

2044
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,200
um whatever she was doing i got to

2045
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,839
follow

2046
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,279
that's just life as a the youngest and

2047
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:50,558
wherever she would be my mom was big

2048
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,760
into genealogy still is and a lot of

2049
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,480
places that uh back you know when i was

2050
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,559
little

2051
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,960
they were just these old old old

2052
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,359
computers that people did genealogy on

2053
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,720
and you'd always go visit people who

2054
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:05,279
were even older than your parents who

2055
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,160
had even older computers

2056
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,559
because that's where they kept their

2057
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,598
genealogy yeah

2058
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,359
um and and i'd

2059
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,960
ask them you know like can i play on the

2060
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,839
computer like oh there's no games i'm

2061
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
like

2062
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:21,038
we'll see because they had no clue right

2063
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,920
and so after

2064
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,760
30 minutes of poking around on you know

2065
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,119
each time we got faster

2066
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,200
by just poking around trying to figure

2067
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,880
out dos i come up with like

2068
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,640
what is this keen.exe you know like

2069
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,319
oh my gosh it's commander kane or

2070
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,078
captain king whatever it was

2071
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,680
commander king was legit brandon right

2072
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,319

2073
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,839
like oh my gosh commander keen and then

2074
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,440
just all these weird

2075
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,200
random games that's what i always

2076
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,960
remember finding on people's computers

2077
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,319
because they had no clue

2078
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,240
what happens if it's an exe let's run it

2079
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,240
all right i just remembered one other

2080
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,879
story about games

2081
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,640
first grade i lived in some city i was

2082
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,160
about to say you could anyway

2083
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,839
i don't know what security questions i

2084
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,799
might have no skin they're all random

2085
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,279
crap anyway

2086
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,280
but i lived in a rural town that had

2087
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:13,359
like two computers

2088
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,200
and we would go to school early because

2089
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:17,680
they let you into the computer lab

2090
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,640
and you could use them and this is first

2091
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,118
grade i'm like

2092
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,400
six years old or something and me and my

2093
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,039
brother larry just started going

2094
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,640
earlier and earlier so much that my mom

2095
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,520
made some rule like you can't leave the

2096
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,440
house until

2097
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,520
6 30 or something we just kept getting

2098
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,799
up and going earlier to school

2099
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,799
because they'd let you in and you could

2100
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,720
just go play on the computer and there

2101
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,319
was this one game it was just it's like

2102
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,240
an apple ii or something and it was

2103
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,000
you're like a triangle i don't remember

2104
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,078
what color and it was just blocks

2105
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,240
and all you would hit is right and left

2106
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,760
and the blocks would just snake around

2107
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,439
and you just didn't hit the edge and i

2108
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,680
would just zone i would just vibe to

2109
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,240
that thing right just fine

2110
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,598
just hours and hours and in fact when i

2111
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,000
decided i was finally gonna try to make

2112
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,520
a video

2113
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,039
game that's the one me and my buddy

2114
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,520
chris fieri made

2115
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,280
wall scraper on android yeah it was a

2116
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,000
remake of that game from my

2117
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,440
six six-year-old childhood instead of a

2118
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,720
box you're just a guy falling down a

2119
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,480
hole and the walls are moving

2120
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,240
but it was just like uh like i don't

2121
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,559
know it was just

2122
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,238
computers just immediately was just like

2123
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,440
there's a whole other place you can go

2124
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:20,559
that you can get

2125
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,759
one too many like one time your time to

2126
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,679
this device

2127
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,880
whereas i was a lot of kids in our

2128
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,799
family where

2129
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,719
everything else was whatever you watched

2130
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,278
on tv is what somebody else put on

2131
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,799
whatever you're doing as a family they

2132
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,920
somebody else decided rarely was a

2133
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,799
decision mine

2134
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,600
so on a computer you could just pick i

2135
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,359
want to do

2136
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,719
this and you would do that and that was

2137
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,319
yours now of course you had to share

2138
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,960
resources and crap but

2139
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,359
it was just like eye-opening to me and

2140
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,120
still

2141
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,040
is right you i'm literally talking to

2142
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,960
you sitting in my house

2143
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,120
two hours away from a computer they're

2144
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,960
just they're they're amazing

2145
01:08:53,120 --> 01:09:00,000
yeah the funny uh similar

2146
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:03,920

left

2150
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,319
my four-year-old walked up to my wife

2151
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,920
the other day

2152
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:19,199
mom right what is she doing logging in

2153

2154
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,158
video game yeah

2155
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:27,278
he's four like my kids are doing some

2156
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,279
stuff i wish

2157

i want to like see them do more i would

2158
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,880
love for them to like circumvent some of

2159
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,719
my controls they just don't

2160
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,239
it's just the the look on my wife's face

2161
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,839
was priceless because she's like

2162
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,198
what did she just do and i'm over there

2163
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,479
die and laugh and i'm like she just

2164
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:42,719
hacked your phone so she could play a

2165
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,718
game

2166
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,199
that's a proud papa right there yeah

2167
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,600
girl it's like

2168
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,960
they are using these massively more

2169
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,199
intense computing devices

2170
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,040
and doing it natively easier than we

2171
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:57,199
ever did absolutely yeah

2172
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,800
my one-year-old's touching the tv yeah

2173
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,400
cause she thinks it's a touch screen

2174
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,320
that's my favorite how come it's not

2175
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,239
swiping yeah come on dad

2176
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,920
different show different show right

2177
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:09,519
but you take those challenges like some

2178
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,880
of my kids i thought my four year old

2179
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,960
was tablet bound

2180
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,719
and i bought him a laptop uh coveted

2181
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,640
style and you tell him like there's

2182
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,920
minecraft on here and you can play with

2183
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,000
your siblings

2184
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,960
he now can use a full mouse and keyboard

2185
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,040
i mean it's not like

2186
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,400
like we do where we hit control they do

2187
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
it with like their thumb and then like

2188
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,040
pivot

2189
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,320
but it's like crazy i'm like how the

2190
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,080
freak and they're just doing this and

2191
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,679
jumping and just playing and

2192
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,000
you know they they learn really fast

2193
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:38,400
when there's a motivating factor like

2194
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,840
video games especially this age yeah

2195
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,360
well it's yeah my my son is

2196
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,360
way too much like me that's all i'm

2197
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,360
going to say i talked a little bit about

2198
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,280
this before where i was like

2199
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,040
i'm like son you've got to learn how to

2200
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:54,639
clean up after yourself

2201
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:57,679
you're just going to shave the edges and

2202
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,440
he was born with a full mustache no

2203
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,880
but no like seriously like if you're

2204
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,199
gonna do stuff like

2205
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,920
get around my my controls i've made for

2206
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,239
you guys

2207
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,760
you've gotta clean it up afterward all

2208
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,360
right you've gotta make it so dad

2209
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,280
doesn't know

2210
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,880
and i know that's a slippery slope but

2211
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,120
at the same time it's like i want to see

2212
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,280
you do that because that's how i learned

2213
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,239
like that's how everyone really does

2214
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,639
learn

2215
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:22,718
yeah you get mentored whatnot but that

2216
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,159
break the barrier the think around

2217
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:27,760
things you know it's like

2218
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,839
how can i do this um i mean

2219
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,719
for me in school i i was i had to learn

2220
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,400
novell and learn how to get past nobel

2221
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,159
and there happened to be a three or four

2222
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,599
letter or four key sequence that could

2223
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:40,080
get you past novella

2224
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,440
in the days where i did it you just get

2225
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,280
past your login screen

2226
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:47,839
and get to what you needed you know

2227
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,639
and those are things you had to to try

2228
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,960
or learn or

2229
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,080
get from a friend and that was just

2230
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,840
great

2231
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,360
but yeah it's funny to watch these kids

2232
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,840
like

2233
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,280
learn how to do those things like the

2234
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,640
best is when i wake up and he's being

2235
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,320
all ninja trying to grab something

2236
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,440
that's like on my headboard

2237
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,400
because i put it there to deter him and

2238
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,839
he's just like

2239
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,960
i wake up and he's like hey dad i just

2240
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,239

2256
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:50,239
me yeah we'll see how long it takes here

2257
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,480
maybe 10 years i don't know she's a

2258
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:55,678
smart one

2259
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:57,280
yes he's gonna say that's the one thing

2260
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,960
i need to do in my little home office

2261
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,679
it's all that stuff's at work because i

2262
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,880
uh keep all my lock picks and stuff

2263
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,960
there because that's where i would show

2264
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,360
people how to use them and

2265
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,400
they can learn and i could watch them do

2266
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,599
that

2267
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,400
the the joy of popping a lock followed

2268
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,159
by the

2269
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,839
the crushing defeat of understanding

2270
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:19,920
that nothing's perfectly secure

2271
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,440
um but i and we do that because

2272
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,120
people vendors come in the office and

2273
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,639
all that stuff too like here pop a lock

2274
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,640
i'll show you how

2275
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,000
and how you know and i need to bring

2276
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,719
that home for them to play with now

2277
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,840
since i

2278
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,400
work from home just like just most of us

2279
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,640
right

2280
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,440
yeah i'm really liking the uh the theme

2281
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,440
of your home office

2282
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,320
i love it dude i need to do more for my

2283
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,599
kids to learn that way

2284
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,000
the one thing that they do different

2285
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,880
than me and it's it's great don't get me

2286
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,239
wrong it's like like i want you to play

2287
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,040
video games

2288
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,599
i want you to do this you just have to

2289
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,519
do your

2290
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,120
you know you do your chores and you can

2291
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,000
play a video game they're like okay

2292
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,640
awesome sounds great like we have vr you

2293
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,280
know

2294
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,840
we've got everything we've got a lock of

2295
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,519
box which is just a retropie box

2296
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,960
you know like you can play whatever

2297
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,640
video game you want in the house

2298
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,640
just do your chores and they'll run and

2299
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,920
do their chores and someone knocks at

2300
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,840
the door and they completely forget

2301
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,760
about it which is fantastic

2302
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,280
like i love that you don't play video

2303
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,800
games as ton but go play with friends

2304
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,800
and stuff like that

2305
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,960
and it's a little bit harder now with

2306
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,480
the quarantine aspect but

2307
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,600
um but it was just for me i was like i'd

2308
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,718
rather just play video games with my

2309
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,760
friends i've been like hey come watch me

2310
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,760
play video games

2311
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,320
but everything that you were ever told

2312
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,640
not to spend time on

2313
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,320
as a kid ends up being what makes a ton

2314
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,480
of money when you're older so

2315
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,719
don't don't play on the computers and tv

2316
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,519
now tv went from three channels to

2317
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,760
how many channels and and computers

2318
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,199
turned into billions of dollars and

2319
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,400
then you're like don't play video games

2320
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,599
and now kids are making millions of

2321
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,040
dollars on video games so

2322
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,719
whatever you think your kids shouldn't

2323
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,880
do they probably should because they're

2324
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,640
going to make a lot of money doing it

2325
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,400
we talk about we used to pull down

2326
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,679
videos and music and stuff like that

2327
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,920
that's basically what our streaming

2328
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,440
services are now

2329
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,679
it is better that's everything it's

2330
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,839
killing regular tv a legal way of doing

2331
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,960
it now

2332
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:20,480
yeah the only thing keeping uh

2333
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,679
tv alive is sports but that's just my

2334
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,440
opinion

2335
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:28,560
sports ball with goals

2336
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,159
