00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,679
so i want to start out by just saying a

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
little bit

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
about covid19 we hope that you're all

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,080
being safe

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
that your families are safe that

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
everything is going well for you

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,640
we wish you well and we wish you could

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
be here with us and we're

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,280
we're saddened that this is all going on

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,159
and that we can't be with you in person

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
but we're hopeful that this conference

27
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
will be an

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,039
opportunity to meet up with you to spend

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
some time with you

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,560
virtually in an environment that is not

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
only safe

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,759
but sometimes some place that you can

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
find

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
a little bit of a break from everything

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
that's going on around you

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,398
and have some time to network and talk

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,158
and work together

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
as we weather this storm which we will

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,119
do

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
together

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,799

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
of conduct

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,120

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,160
other section of apparel

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,880
that you're going to want to get

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
we'd like to thank discord at this time

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,520
for the opportunity we have to use their

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
service

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,440
to provide cent con this year discord it

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,960
has the cho

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,680
is the chosen voice and video text

125
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
comms that we've chosen for saintcon

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,440
we've also chosen discord for utah saint

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
purposes as well

128
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,440
so long term we plan to use discord as

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
our main method

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
of community members getting together

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,039
and communicating

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,880
we've found that discord has what we

133
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
need as a community

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
to accomplish the goals that we have and

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
it fits

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,680
so much better for our community mostly

137
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
because of its video services

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,520
and and some of the other things that we

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,440
can do with it have been very very

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,680
powerful and very helpful

141
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
so if you'd like to join us which

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
everything

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
this year for saintcon will be on

144
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120

but for just a moment

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
we want to talk about some of the

150
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,799

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,960

173
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,199
that in just a moment

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
main track is where you're going to see

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,400
all sorts of live information

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,719
as we come up with it and so please take

177
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
a look at main track

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
and a really cool thing that might not

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,599
be totally explana

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
explained in this is a channel called

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,120
look what i did

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
and that channel is kind of a cool

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
opportunity

184
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,159
for you to share everything that you've

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
done

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
um during this conference so or or even

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,039
during the year

188
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,599
quite frankly if you're working on a

189
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,039
project say you're building the badge

190
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
and you're done with the badge you want

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,639
to take a picture of the badge and pop

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,719
it into look what i did

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,520
or if you're building a raspberry pi for

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
some project who knows what it is

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,359
post it and look what i did and it's a

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
great opportunity to share with other

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
members of the community

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,080
and show what you're working on and get

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,759
some comments and feedback

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,318
in this particular instance you can see

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
that bash ninja posted his

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,599
internet connection speed that he did a

203
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,240
speed test

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,240
and it's incredibly fast pretty cool

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,800
i want to talk about hallway for just a

206
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,799
moment hallway is named after

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
the saintcon hallway videos that pope

208
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720
did if you haven't had a chance to look

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
at those

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
get on youtube onto the centcon channel

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,720
and watch those hallway videos there's

212
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
some really cool content

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
and some really cool interviews with

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,638
some very well known

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
members of the community but in hallway

216
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
it gives you an opportunity to get

217
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,840
together and network

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,878
with other people in the st con

219
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,799
community

220
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,680
we wanted to give you a place that you

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,160
could organically and ad hoc

222
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,960
just get together and discuss a security

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
topic

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,359
or a or mentor an individual or anything

225
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,159
else

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
that might be useful to you if they're

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,838
video rooms that are open

228
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
and available for your use you don't

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
need an appointment

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
you don't have to ask permission just go

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,399
use them that's what they're

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
there for we have communities and

233
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,920
communities are

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,680
awesome and this the community section

235
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,120
is what you would typically see down

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,719
in the main floor at sync con this year

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
we'll be doing lock picking hardware

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
hacking

239
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,600
and cis controls and in those

240
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,719
communities you're going to have some

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
opportunities

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,640
to see how to pick a walk and how to

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,160
solder in hardware hacking and a few

244
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
other things that they'll be doing

245
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,040
ad hoc throughout the conference pay

246
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,519
attention to the announcements channel

247
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
in discord for information regarding

248
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
what is happening

249
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,839
in those communities and when it's

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,040
happening

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,920
sync con is loaded with contests and

252

among us is kind of a cool game that's

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
kind of branched out in the pandemic

297
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,359
most of you probably know exactly what

298
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,519
it is

299
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
have probably played it but what we're

300
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
going to do is we're going to have some

301
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,920
among us

302
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,480
competitions that are going to help test

303
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,199
and and hone in your social engineering

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
skills

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
so that you understand better how social

306
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
engineering works and thus

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
can protect yourself and prepare your

308
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
organizations

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
better for social engineering attacks

310
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
come check out

311
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,519
so among us social engineering contests

312
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,000
on the website at the link listed

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
we also have some events this year at st

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
conn

315
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
one of the cool events that we're going

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
to be doing because we can't meet in

317
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
person is we're going to try to do

318
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,720
something that is as close as possible

319
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,760
so we've developed well we've worked

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
with outspace

321
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,439
vr to ensure that we have a virtual

322
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,319
area where you can meet up and talk with

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,600
everyone

324
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,760
and it's as close as we can get without

325
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
actually being physically there

326
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,480
you do not need a vr headset to

327
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,360
participate you can use your computer

328
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,639
um alt space vr works with a computer

329
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
you're going to want to look for hidden

330
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,800
puzzles

331
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,880
in those spaces and you find to find out

332
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
more about when they're happening go to

333
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,680
stone.org

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,839
events vr the link listed on the screen

335
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,920
one thing that we started last year that

336
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,880
was phenomenally successful

337
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,639
was whose slide is it anyway some of you

338
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,439
watched it some of you participated in

339
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,160
it some of you

340
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
were the the the folks that actually

341
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,920
played the game

342
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
and we laughed at you either way it's

343
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
going to be fun

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,519
and come and laugh with us and at

345
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,760
us and at me um as a few of us

346
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,800
attempt to play this absolutely

347
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,839
hilarious

348
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,359
and and and quite frankly embarrassing

349
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,880
game

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,959
you can find the schedule for whose

351
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,680
slide is it anyway on the website

352
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,399
at the link listed workspace tours

353
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,920
we are going to provide you with some

354
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
cool opportunities to see

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,519
the inner workings of a geek workspace

356
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
and we've got several individuals who

357
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
are lined up to show you kind of their

358
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
workspace and

359
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,800
what they have and what they work on and

360
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
and their projects and their hobbies

361
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,319
and the things that they like come take

362
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,839
a look at it

363
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,399
using the the discord app we're going to

364
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
just show you how deep the geekiness

365
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,440
goes in some

366
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,560
a few of us we also have virtual job

367
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
fair this year

368
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,920
and we're hoping that employers will

369
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
come and join us

370
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,199
at the virtual job fair on wednesday and

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,480

372
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,000
um from 2 p.m to 3 p.m and so if you

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
want to join up that

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
if you're interested in looking for a

375
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
job or you're interested in looking for

376
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
employees

377
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,880
this is an ad hoc virtual job fair

378
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
that'll give you an opportunity to meet

379
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,839
up with employers or potential

380
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
employees

381
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,240
we will be having presentations this

382
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
year we're not going to have nearly as

383
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
many as we usually do

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
but we will be having presentations and

385
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
those presentations will be released on

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
a daily basis

387
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,040
on youtube so look for that information

388
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,040
we'll put that in the announcements as

389
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,040
we release them

390
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,719
community talks will also be happening

391
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,880
now those community talks will be down

392
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
in the community section in discord

393
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
and watch for those announcements as we

394
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
talked about earlier

395
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
so you can have an opportunity to learn

396
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
how to solder

397
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,680
or learn how to pick a lock or other

398
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
things that they may be doing

399
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,199
and there is so much more

400
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
cenkon is going to be loaded with lots

401
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,479
of fun things this year

402
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
it's not going to be nearly as big as it

403
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,199
has in the past

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,240
but it is going to be the core core

405
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,040
awesome things that we do at sync con

406
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320

407
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
to learn from another

408
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,519
one another to mentor each other to

409
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
reach out

410
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,680
and talk about security issues to

411
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,160
discuss those as a community

412
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
to reconnect with those people in the

413
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,760
community who

414
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,079
