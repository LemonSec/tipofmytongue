23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
so the things we're going to need to

24
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
download are kicad

25
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
which is the software where you actually

26
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,480
create the circuit board

27
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,000
you'll also need inkscape where you

28
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
design the artwork

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,480
and then a couple libraries and plugins

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
for those tools

31
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,078
so all the links are on in the video

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
as on my github page which is also

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,240

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,799

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,798
download

37
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,920
and pick your operating system

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,880
uh the version that i'll be using this

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
tutorial is 5.1.7 which is the most

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,158
current as of

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,000
october 2020. so

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
pick the download location that's

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
closest to you geographically

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,039
and this is a fairly large download

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
about 1.2 gigabytes

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
once that's downloaded go ahead and

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,840
install that you can

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
use all the default settings on the

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,159
installer

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,520
the next thing is inkscape and the

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,600
current version

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,039

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,520

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
here

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,640
and just for windows 232 or 64-bit

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,318
download that and install it once you've

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
got that done

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,839
you'll need an inkscape plug-in this one

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,520
is called svg2 shenzhen

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,280

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,560
code and downloads up here scroll down

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,160
and they have releases for

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
different operating systems right here

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,959
that have just the files you need

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
and then the last thing you'll need to

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,640

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,920

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,359

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,720
pins

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
less stuff you have to worry about to

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,920
