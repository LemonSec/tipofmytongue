00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,799
hello

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,600
and welcome to saint con single user

6
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,720
mode we're glad you're here

7
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
this year has been crazy we've learned

8
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
how to be

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
socially distant we've learned how to

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
work from home and be

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
somewhat effective and we've learned how

12
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
to

13
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
live our lives almost completely online

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
for human interaction

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
this is something that saintcon was

16
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,759
never really meant to be

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
but here we are

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
many months ago when we were doing our

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
preliminary st

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
con planning we were hopeful that by the

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,159
time that

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,000
october rolled around an in-person event

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,759
might still be possible

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
but as many of you know in july it

25
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,519
became quite apparent that

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,959
that wasn't going to happen and october

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
wasn't going to look much better than

28
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
any of the other months have looked this

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
year so

30
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,720
we came up with the idea of doing a

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
saintcon single user mode event

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,800
that's more virtual than anything else

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
what we wanted to say is saintcon first

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
and foremost

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,599
is about our community it's where we

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,440
come together to

37
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,679
learn from each other it's where we come

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,440
together to share ideas

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
and to build relationships sadly

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,599
a lot of that social aspect of saintcon

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,839
isn't going to be possible this year in

42
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,319
the same way that we would hope

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,519
so here we are what is single user mode

44
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,640
what does it mean well hopefully many of

45
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
you understand that

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
a single user mode boot of an operating

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
system is a way to

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
reach the low level functionality of

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
that operating system and

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,840
do important things like change an

51
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
administrator password or

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
install new drivers or make

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
configuration tweaks to improve the

54
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,319
performance

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,040
of the of the system

56
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,958
this is an abnormal function for the

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
operating system you don't normally boot

58
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
into single user mode

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
you do it when it's important to change

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,798
or improve something

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,000
so sync con single user mode

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,799
what is it not well saintcon single user

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
mode

64
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
is not going to try to replicate what we

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
do

66
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,679
when we're doing sync con in person

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,120
rather what we're going to do is

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,120
bridge the gap of distance and bring our

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
community together in a virtual way to

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,040
make it easier for

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
us to interact and to learn from each

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
other like we normally do

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,480
and perhaps even just have a little bit

74
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,640
of fun

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,760
so what sync con single user mode is

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,439
is a focus on ourselves just like we

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
boot an operating system to make

78
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,359
low-level changes

79
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
we're using that as a reference to boot

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
ourselves this week and

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,199
focus on ourselves and make low-level

82
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,880
changes improve some of our skills or

83
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
capabilities or

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,560
build better relationships with those

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,198
around us in our community

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
learning something new or interesting

87
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
even if it is just

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,440
interacting with our peers

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,758
a lot of what saintcon is going to be

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
this year is up to you

91
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960
you need to find ways to get involved we

92
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
can't force

93
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,799
interaction through a virtual event it's

94
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
not that easy

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
so my recommendation to you is find a

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,599
mentor

97
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,240
somebody in our environment that has a

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,360
lot of skills or capabilities in an area

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,400
and learn something from them or

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
better yet become a mentor i know many

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,198
of you have skills and capabilities that

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
would be

103
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
valuable to share with others and i

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
would recommend that this week you take

105
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,919
a little bit of time and

106
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,800
give back to the community or

107
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,039
if you're a little bit introverted maybe

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,280
this week you just find some time

109
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
to learn something new or interesting

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,880
that you've always wanted to learn

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,560
but have just never dedicated the time

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,080
to do that

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,919
it's really up to you

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,880
so this year our plans are to administer

115
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
the conference

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
using the platform called discord

117
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,199
hopefully many of you are familiar with

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
it i'll put up a handy url right here

119
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,400
so that you can connect with the

120
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,800
community

121
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,799
in there and a lot of what we're doing

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
in sync single user mode will happen in

123
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
discord this year

124
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,600
so take some time learn how it works

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,199
learn how to join different channels and

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
different audio discussions and other

127
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
things

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
so that you can get the most out of what

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
we're doing

130
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
for saintcon single user mode this year

131
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
i'd also encourage you to participate in

132
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,800
a lot of the events that are going on

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
not all of them are going to appeal to

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
you and that's okay you don't have to

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
join the things that you don't want to

136
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,318
join but

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,638
we're making a a large broad

138
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
offering of activities and events

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,560
available

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
so that you can get involved in the

141
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
things that do interest you

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
one of the things about discord that i

143
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,039
wanted to mention to today

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
is to let you know that our utah saint

145
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,318
community

146
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
is actually going to be moving off of

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
slack

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,960
onto discord on a permanent basis and so

149
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,318
watch first details and updates in the

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,799
coming weeks and months

151
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
on how and when we're going to make

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
those transitions from our slack

153
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
instance

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,000
discord will be our community center

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,800
moving forward

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
for now what i invite you to do is get

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
in the spirit of saintcon

158
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
maybe go to our website download a

159
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,638
couple of desktop backgrounds and set

160
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,880
them up

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
just to remind you what's going on this

162
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,199
week and where your focus

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
should be uh wear your cool sink con

164
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,240
shirt

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
turn on your webcam and let us see your

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
beautiful face in one of the chat

167
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
one of the chat channels inside of

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,560
discord or wherever

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,080
the the capability arises or one of the

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,639
other things

171
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,639
build a badge we made sure that we

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
