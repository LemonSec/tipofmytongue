1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,080
all right so we've got our menu badge

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,680
design now it's time to send it off to

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,719
the fabricator

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,239
so from here we need to export some

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
files that

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
the badge manufacturer can use to

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,759
actually make a board

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
so up here at the top there's this plot

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
button

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,680
click that

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,439
and this is going to create the files

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,759
for the manufacturer

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
over here you kind of leave everything

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
as it is

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,160
it's pretty much already selected gives

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
them the

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,279
the copper layer the silk screen layer

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
the mask layers

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
and the edge cuts layer the things we

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,680
want to change

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
right here this use proto file name

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,480
extensions

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,480
click that and then click plot

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
and this just created a whole bunch of

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,879
files

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
alongside our project files here and

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
then we're going to click generate drill

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
files

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,640
you can leave this at the defaults

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,479
should be good

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,520
and click generate drill file

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,720
close that close this one

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,960
and now we've got our files so those

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
are

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,320
let's go get those where they are in our

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,520
folder okay so here's my

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,240
kycad project folder and in here

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,759
there are now a ton of files and it can

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,000
be a little confusing

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,520
but try to stay with me here so here's

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,280
our

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,399
our pcb file dot pro is our project

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,119
file and sch is our schematic file

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
okay the easiest way to do this is to

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,040
sort

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,720
by the modified date which means all the

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
recently created files are right up here

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
at the top

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,240
so what we're going to do is select the

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,680
drl file as well as all these other ones

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,720
that were created just now when we

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,760
did that plot okay

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
so we've got all those selected right

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
click

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,640
and we're going to create a zip file out

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
of these

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,239
uh just like that and so

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
inside this zip file is all the files

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
that we need to make a board

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,560
so this zip file is what we are going to

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,680
send to the manufacturer

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,440
so let's see what that looks like

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,440
open up a browser go to oshpark.com

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,958
and this is what it looks like so

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,360
we can drop our file right here

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
you can click browse you can just grab

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
this

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,120
drag it on there and it's going to

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
show you what your board is going to

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
look like

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
one thing i really love about osh park

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
is the system they've got set up for

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,640
showing you a preview of the board

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,079
it's really awesome one of the best i've

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,238
seen and used

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
in fact sometimes i'll use it for

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
projects that

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,159
i end up producing other places just

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,920
because it's so good and so pretty

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,879
so this is telling us about our board

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,518
it says how big it is how much it'll

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,319
cost

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
to have it made you can give it a name

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
and a description here

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
this shows you the front of it and this

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,159
is the back of it

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
so if we click continue

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,599
then it'll show us every layer so

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,519
here's the top what it's going to look

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,480
like and you'll note here

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
you can see our our cutout there but it

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,119
doesn't show that it's cut out

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
and it says right here the internal in

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
cutouts

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
are indicated by a black outline but not

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,400
filled in

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,400
so that is fine looks good there

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
here's what the bottom is going to look

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,319
like

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,840
and so this helps us just kind of

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
visually check that everything is

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,798
correct with our files

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,000
so here's the holes that are going to be

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
drilled in our circuit board

105
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,078
here's what's on the bottom silk screen

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,599
here's the board outline including the

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
cutout that's important to make sure

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
that it's

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,800
there top solder mask again so this is

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,320
going to be color and this is showing

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,919
where there's not going to be any of the

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,120
color

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,198
top silk screen bottom solder mask

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
same thing color and where there isn't

115
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,840
going to be any and these are where our

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,080
resistor and led are going to connect so

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,599
it's important it does show up there

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
this is the bottom layer showing the

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,520
traces that we've got there

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,239
top layer we didn't put any traces there

121
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,120
so that all looks really good got all

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,120
the layers we need

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,840
if we come down here click order

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,000
here we go so quantity three

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
ash park always makes everything in

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
threes

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
so if you want more than that it's gonna

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,560
go to six nine

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
eh et cetera so it costs three dollars

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
and twenty cents

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
that's what it costs to have this made

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,479
now the code that you should have gotten

133
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,840
with your

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
badge is good for three dollars and 20

135
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,560
cents

136
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
should exactly cover the cost of this

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,759
so some other options you've got here um

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,198
which are up to you a lot of these cost

139
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
more uh if you want it quicker but

140
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,280
i mean i don't you really need it that

141
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,520
quick the standard

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,520
turnaround time on this is under two

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,799
weeks which is pretty good considering

144
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,599
this is all

145
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,720
produced in the u.s no shipping from

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,039
overseas anything like that

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
but super swift can be handy if you're

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
in a crunch it'll basically get it to

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,680
you in a week

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,840
um this is for making lots more

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
hours for thicker copper which we don't

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,359
need because we're not doing any high

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
power stuff

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
making flexible circuit boards that's

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
really expensive

156
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
this one is an option that you can

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,120
choose that doesn't cost more

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,080
it's called after dark and so in

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
the circuit board if you ever look a lot

160
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,440
of circuit boards are kind of this

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,479
yellowish material inside

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,000
and this is actually a

163
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,120
black circuit board with a clear

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,360
mask on top of it and so

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,039
there's it's not the traditional green

166
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
or whatever color

167
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
it'll look black and then you'll see all

168
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,758
the traces on it

169
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
and then you'll have your white silk

170
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
screen on top of it it's a really

171
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,440
interesting color combination

172
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
it doesn't cost any more here but it

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,400
does take a little bit longer

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,840
to do so that's up to your discretion if

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,840
you want to choose that option

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,679
and then once you're done making your

177
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
choices here

178
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,280
click checkout and enter your

179
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
gift code put in your name and address

180
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,239
and all that good stuff

181
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
and in a couple weeks you'll have your

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
very own

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,638
