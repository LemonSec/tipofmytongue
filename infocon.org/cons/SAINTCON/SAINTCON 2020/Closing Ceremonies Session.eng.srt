a q a but in order to make sure that

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,279
this was as stable as possible we

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,080
decided to

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,279
do this via other technology uh to make

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
sure that uh

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,040
we could go through our closing

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
ceremonies i don't have a bunch of

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
slides or anything else we're gonna do

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,680
this just old school style and just say

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
hey welcome to closing ceremonies for

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,200
saintcon

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,839
um and here here you are and here we are

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
um as i kind of mentioned in our in my

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
opening remarks

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,519
uh it was a really interesting year to

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
plan for sync khan and

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,879
and there was a lot of disappointment in

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,199
our committee not not

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,919
for our committee in our committee's

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,640
hearts

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
when we had to cancel uh an in-person

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
event and

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
around the july time frame when we made

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,200
that decision and

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
and so we're glad that we were able to

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
pull even a virtual event

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,920
like this together and as you've kind of

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,080
noticed this has been a lot more about

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
uh just a community hangout and having

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,520
some fun and

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,400
and doing some interesting things it's

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,199
not been as i mentioned a way to try and

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
replicate something that we do in person

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
because i don't think that that's what

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
sync con really has ever intended to be

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,960
is something something that's virtual

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,240
and so anyways uh maybe to kick us off

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,000
on this uh path of closing this out uh

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,320
maybe i'll just say we want to thank

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
everybody all of our attendees for

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520

well that's great all right so the only

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
other person that uh

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
i i mean the entire committee as you're

193
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,120
seeing them on the screen

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
uh comp will throw them up there as kind

195
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
of a grid view

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
and there's actually even more than this

197
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,719
uh this isn't everybody but

198
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
uh this is the group of people that get

199
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
together

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,198
and do all of the planning and and

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,159
things for this this event

202
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,319
and when we switched gears in july and

203
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
decided ah you know let's just cancel it

204
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
but let's not cancel cancel

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,479
it let's kind of create something and

206
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,039
then that thing

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,719
snowballs and becomes more and more and

208
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
bigger and more complicated and

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
everything else

210
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
and you get what you get uh in the end

211
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
but this is the group that makes it

212
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,639
happen and we're i'm so

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319

214
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,520

226
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
he's done a stellar job on the store and

227
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
when he signed up for it

228
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
just want to say he signed up for it to

229
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,318
be a store at the conference where he

230
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,479
just unboxes a few things and

231
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
and uh and takes a little bit of cash

232
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,639
and stuff and he's actually had to turn

233
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,720

234
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,800

working and stuff this year than

262
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
than i've heard in many years past and

263
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
so

264
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
it's it's a wonderful thing maybe the

265
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
interview question for you for just to

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
take a minute or so what's 2021 going to

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
look like

268
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
uh for the sincon badge i know that

269
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
you've already got it

270
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,480
planned i've seen lots of prototypes

271
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,839
don't reveal too much but

272
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,839
maybe give people a teaser

273
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,040
um oh i don't know what i can reveal

274
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,959
without revealing too much about it

275
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,040
um don't be a battering

276
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,839
that's true there will be a battery and

277
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,360
a display of some sort

278
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
um we're going for very interactive

279
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
with this badge which is one of the

280
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,760
reasons we skipped it this year

281
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,800
is we're trying to get people talking to

282
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,080
each other a lot more

283
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,359
and interacting physically so

284
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
it should be really good so basically

285
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,279
what he means by that is

286
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,000
if cobit is still a thing a year from

287
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,000
now when we have this conference

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
and somebody brings it to saintcon

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
you're guaranteed to get it because

290
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
you're gonna want to play the badge

291
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
challenges uh and so close interaction

292
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
will be necessary

293
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
um i have seen the prototype boards and

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
other things

295
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,560
it is absolutely stellar and you won't

296
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,599
want to miss it next year

297
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,599
and so here's hoping that 2021

298
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
uh turns out to be a year that we can do

299
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
an in-person conference

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
everything seems to point that way uh

301
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
but as i mentioned in my

302
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
uh my general chats uh posting earlier

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
today

304
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
we are still going to error on the side

305
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,880
of being safe

306
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
as we get through this coming year and

307
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
everything else so

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,760
so stay tuned we're gonna make some

309
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,519
announcements in march about the event

310
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,079
and when it's going to be

311
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,880
and such we're going to kind of continue

312
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
our planning

313
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,480
and then we'll do a kind of a go no-go

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,760
meeting sometime in late june early july

315
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,079
and make sure that we're still good to

316
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,040
go and that's when we'll do a final

317
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,680
commitment

318
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,319
for an in-person event but again here's

319
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,719
hoping

320
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,720
and that we can do that because man

321
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,680
we've missed a lot of you guys

322
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,120
and that being said you know we've loved

323
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
the opportunity to

324
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
to interact today i've heard a lot of

325
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
voices and interacted with a lot of

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,240
folks that i haven't seen or heard from

327
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,320
for months and months and so man if

328
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
there's anything that i can say is this

329
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
community

330
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,959

331
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
opportunity to

332
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,160
to hang out and have a good time play

333
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
some among us

334
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
and and and look at each other's uh

335
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
workspaces

336
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
and and just in general have a lot of

337
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
fun and

338
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
and that's really what this event was

339
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,839
for and hopefully it became something

340
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,760
that's not the new normal for you it

341
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,240
wasn't your average normal

342
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,680
uh online event and that you actually

343
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
got to do something

344
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,680

345
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,560

346
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800

all right and then you know so many

408
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
other folks as

409
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,040
again you're seeing on the screen that

410
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,638
are involved in this

411
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,839
uh i'm just going to pause right here

412
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
and see if there's anybody that has

413
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,120
anything in particular

414
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
that they wanted to say mention or or

415
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,160
make sure it gets included in this

416
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,399
process today so troy

417
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,000
speaking of keeping it going how long

418
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,920
are we going to keep the store going

419
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
oh that's a really good question i would

420
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,120
say get your merchandise

421
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,959
uh get your merch uh taken care of

422
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,839
fairly quickly because anything that's

423
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
left over

424
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,160
uh is gonna disappear and it's gonna go

425
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,120
into the vault for a year and you won't

426
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,079
be able to see it until

427
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
next year again and we do that because

428
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,079
of

429
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,320
tax issues and things uh we can't run

430
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,239
a forever store we can only run it in

431
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
conjunction with our events

432
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,279
and so uh grab your stuff we'll leave it

433
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
up for

434
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,720
at least the weekend and then after that

435
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,359
i think it's appropriate for us to

436
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,800
tear it down so uh great question and

437
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,160
there's your answer

438
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
through the weekend okay so there there

439
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
will be

440
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,160
some items that ship after the store is

441
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
closed

442
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,160
um

443
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,599
so but we'll go ahead and print

444
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,040
this i don't know if it's just me or if

445
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
it's just bryce but

446
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
a lot of that was really rough there for

447
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,600
a second

448
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,119
but oh sorry no that's okay

449
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
i'll i'll reiterate what you said it's

450
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
it's okay uh at this point

451
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
he what he's saying is that there's a

452
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
lot of the items that will be

453
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,319
that are sold that have delivery dates

454
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
after the store is going to close

455
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399

456
