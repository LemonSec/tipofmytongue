i hope you're all dry enough and uh

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,359
can understand me

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
my name is thymus hep i work as an

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
artist and as a technology critic and a

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
privacy designer whichever head i wear

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
kind of depends on on where i am

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,880
but in the past couple of years i've

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,479
been working for the european union

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
union in a project called sherpa which

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
was about the future of ai and what

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
issues the european union should deal

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
with around ai

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,760
and as an artist i was allowed to

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
reflect on that research and that led

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,680
amongst other things to the creation of

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
this interactive documentary called how

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,600
normal am i dot eu

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
and this is a website where in five

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
minutes your face will be

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
scanned by your own webcam and then it

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,480
will

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
a number of algorithms will look at your

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,640
face and and judge you and i thought to

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
try it who here has already done it

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
not a lot of people so i thought if if

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,080
you trust

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
i'm also a privacy designer so this

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,439
thing is 100 privacy friendly it runs

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
100 locally on your own device

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
so if you trust me

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560
go ahead for just a minute or two try it

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
so you can kind of get a feel of what it

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,720
is before you continue because then uh

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
my rest of my talk will be a lot easier

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,600
so if you kind of just see in the

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,119
website they're like all right okay this

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
is what it does

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,360
so i'll give you two minutes for that

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,020

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,239
you know

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
so

45
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,369
[Music]

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
oh

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
shall we slowly continue

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,879
you can try it at home all you want and

49
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,079
but at least you got a little bit of the

50
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
vibe of what it is so it judges your

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
face on your beauty and your age and all

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
kinds of things

53
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
so you'll have seen something like this

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
um and when this is what you see when

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,759
you complete it

56
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
so you'll

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
this

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
this project uses a number of

59
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
algorithms or ai that i found online

60
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,040
that were ready made that i just scraped

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
from the internet

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
so beauty that was a chinese algorithm

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
for example age and gender

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,639
emotion etc but there was one that i

65
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
really wanted to add to this project

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
that i could not find

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
small enough in in my searches and that

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
was one to

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
analyze your body mass index or bmi

70
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
based on your face because i know this

71
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
is happening but i couldn't find a small

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,240
enough

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,080
algorithm that i could make downloadable

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
in this project

75
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
so i decided to make one

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
so i'm going to take you on my my bmi

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
prediction safari my github safari as i

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
like to call it where i go to github

79
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
search for a bmi interface and just

80
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
download everything that i can find and

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
then look what i've downloaded and

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
that's just a fascinating

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
thing to do to stroll github for all the

84
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,759
weird stuff that's on there but before i

85
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,039
go into it i'll have to talk a little

86
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,600
bit about what body mass index is

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
so the body mass index is the ratio

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
between your weight and your height

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
that's all it is it's a ratio between

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
those two things

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
and it's important to understand that

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,440
bmi is not a universal thing it's

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
something that you can't easily compare

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
between people because there are a lot

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
of factors that influence how you yeah

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
that influence it for example uh men and

97
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,800
women have very different types of bmi

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
that you can't just compare men and

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
women for example but also culture is a

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
factor and as your sportiness is a

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
factor

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
um i think for example men have just

103
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,000
wider faces that's just a biological

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
effect

105
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
but another example is with sports

106
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
these two people both have a really high

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
bmi

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
but one is because he has a lot of body

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
fat and the other is because he has a

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
lot of muscle mass right but these you

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
can't just say these people have an

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
equal bmi so are equally healthy for

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,120
example so bmi is complicated

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,039
at least that's the theory but if you

115
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
look at in practice what you find when

116
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
you go to github you'll find

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
a lot of projects that that aren't

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759
taking this as seriously

119
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
right so you go to github and you

120
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
download this stuff and this is some of

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,800
the things you'll find this is a from a

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
chinese project there's a lot of chinese

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
and indian projects on there

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
interestingly

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
and here already you see that the entire

126
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
complexity of bmi is just that we're

127
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,280
going to put faces in three buckets

128
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
and those are just thin fat and normal

129
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
so all the complexity is this no we're

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,199
going to make one universal algorithm

131
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,919
and it labels you thin fat or normal

132
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,599
this is another chinese one which is

133
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
slightly more complex which will put you

134
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
in buckets of fat little fat normal thin

135
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
and very fat

136
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
but again not very nuanced there

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
so you might be wondering how do you

138
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,639
even measure someone's face how does

139
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,120
that work well most of these projects

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
use these seven ratios in your face and

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
it's a really quite interesting

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
thing

143
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
they start by breaking down your face

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,599
using a pretty standard uh ai library to

145
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
get 68 points in your face this is

146
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
pretty much what it starts out with it

147
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
reduces your face to this

148
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
and then they create ratios some like

149
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
yeah a lot of like this like cheekbone

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
width divided by jaw width etc and it's

151
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
easier if i just show you a little bit

152
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,599
so

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
this for example is the width of your

154
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
face in the middle of your face

155
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
in relationship to the area of the

156
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
bottom half of your face so that's one

157
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,280
of these ratios that are like the ratio

158
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,639
between those two is one of those

159
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
factors

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,479
another one interestingly is the ratio

161
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,879
between the outside lines from your eyes

162
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
and then one in the middle so this is

163
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
something about how big the area above

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
your eyes is basically

165
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
and apparently if you have a is that

166
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
bigger that must indicate that you're

167
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
have a higher bmi

168
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
another one is this one which is

169
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
the bottom half of your face in

170
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
relationship to the top of your face

171
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,319
but here you'll you'll start to see

172
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,000
something interesting which is remember

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
this one

174
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
there's one thing missing isn't there

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
there is no point in that for the top of

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
your face

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
so what do these projects do to get a

178
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
point for the top of your face

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
well they just extrapolate it by taking

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
the points that they do have so they

181
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
take the points in the corner of your

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
eyes the middle of your eyebrows and

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
they draw a line through it and whatever

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,880
is they intersect that's now going to be

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
the top of your face

186
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
of course you already see the problem

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
with this which is that if you lower or

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
raise your eyebrows it has a tremendous

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
effect on on this where this point is

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
going to be calculated and since you

191
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,399
already know that two of these ratios

192
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,160
are dependent on this point like the one

193
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
between this one and the eyebrows

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
raising or lowering your eyebrows has a

195
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
lot of effects on the score you're going

196
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
to get with a bmi prediction in this

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,920
algorithm

198
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
so why d7 ratios in the first place who

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,959
came up with this well it was a

200
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
psychologist called david coutsey who

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
was researching

202
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
whether or not you could predict bmi

203
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
from your face in the first place he was

204
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
researching whether or not that's

205
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,279
possible

206
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,800
and remember this one

207
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,959
this one's interesting because it's this

208
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,480
one is in all the algorithms that i

209
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,519
found they all use it and

210
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,880
this is what david couture has to say

211
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
about this ratio he says the perimeter

212
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
to area ratio

213
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
did not correlate significantly with bmi

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
in any of the data sets

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
so his own research says don't use this

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
one doesn't work

217
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,560
yet they still all use it right so

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
my point here is that this stuff is not

219
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
very scientific

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
at all it's just the science is very

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
dodgy

222
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
so another question you might have is to

223
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
train an ai you need data to train it on

224
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,600
right you need a lot of things what do

225
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
you need you need in this case a lot of

226
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
photos of people and of those people you

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,959
need their width their weights and their

228
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,760
height

229
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,040
if you have those things you can wait

230
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
and height you can create a bmi score

231
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,079
and you have the face and you can create

232
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,440
your algorithm

233
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
so where do you get that well one of the

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
most popular sources is celebrities

235
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
celebrities have a lot of faces online

236
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
and then all you need is their weight

237
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,560
and their height so where do you get

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,040
that well here it gets very interesting

239
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
they

240
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
get their data sets from from imdb the

241
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
faces

242
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
and then they get the the weights and

243
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
heights from websites like

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
how tall is dot org

245
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
which these types of websites are as far

246
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
as i can tell just fan websites where

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
people are guessing the weight and

248
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
height of these people because it's

249
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
totally unscientific right because you

250
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
need for these photos and these weights

251
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
and heights to be you need the weight

252
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
and height of this person on the photo

253
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
to be measured at the same time as the

254
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,399
photo was taken otherwise you're just

255
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
you know it's not good data but with a

256
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
website like this you have no idea if

257
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
the match the photo and the weight and

258
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
height are any any close to the real

259
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
thing so

260
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,079
the data is a total mess here

261
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
interesting fact is that christian bale

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,839
is very popular in these

263
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,519
in these research papers on how to check

264
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,800
whether or not your algorithm is in any

265
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
way accurate because he played in some

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
movies where he has a very thin face or

267
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
he has a very wide face so if he if the

268
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,519
algorithm kind of does an okay job there

269
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,040
that's a sign that your algorithm is

270
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
okay

271
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
another popular source of data is arrest

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
records so in the united states you can

273
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
be arrested and at that you know without

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
even being found guilty

275
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
your photo will be uploaded online and

276
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
these police officers will also measure

277
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
your weight and your height and it will

278
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
also be made available

279
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
and i found out because i was looking

280
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,720
through all this code and i started

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
finding these these references to things

282
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
like inmates and in the code like what's

283
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,480
going on here

284
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,519
and then i started looking a little bit

285
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
closer and i just realized that on my

286
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
hard drive i had not just code but i had

287
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
data sets of these photos that were

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
apparently also just uploaded to github

289
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,399
which was amazing

290
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,320
i've taken one without a photo here but

291
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
this is kind of what this this looks

292
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
like the police arrest websites where

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
you get all this data and there's some

294
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
very sensitive stuff in here as well

295
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
where it'll also tell you where someone

296
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,959
was arrested and where they were brought

297
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
to including like a mental health

298
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
institution that will just be in that

299
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
data it's absolutely insane

300
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
so this is kind of what it looks like i

301
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
just had this this huge amount of photos

302
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,839
on my hard drive of arrested

303
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,279
people another source that's popular is

304
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
athletes because again you have websites

305
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
full of athletes with their faces as

306
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
well as their weight and height so

307
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,839
another popular source but of course as

308
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,040
we saw earlier

309
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
people who are athletes have a very not

310
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,760
a normal bmi so it's not a great source

311
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
to use

312
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
but perhaps the most interesting one was

313
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
this one maybe the most shocking

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
is reddit

315
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
so i found a project that scraped

316
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,079
reddit's progress pics community

317
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,440
progress pics is a community where

318
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
people share their weight loss progress

319
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
so they show a before and after picture

320
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
and they always use the same format so

321
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,760
it's easy to scrape

322
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
which is exactly what google research

323
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
health india did

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
so i got in contact with him like is

325
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
this an official google project

326
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
and um they said no no no it's not

327
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
official google projects and someone i

328
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
knew at wired and a journalist also

329
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,839
asked them same question and got a

330
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
completely different answer

331
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
and a few a few a little few weeks later

332
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
the project was gone from github

333
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
completely so

334
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
very interesting but yeah they created a

335
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
scraper that just took progress picks

336
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,000
from redis to train their algorithm

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
so i decided to make my own bmi

338
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
prediction algorithm because as i said i

339
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,440
couldn't find one that was

340
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
small enough to use online

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
and what i really want to talk to you is

342
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
about all the design choices i had to

343
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
make in that right because when we talk

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
about ai it can be easy to talk about as

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,079
something

346
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
objective and neutral but it totally

347
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
isn't it's just a lot a large string of

348
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
design choices that i'm making

349
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
so the first one is was i going to be

350
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
nuanced about bmi was i going to take

351
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
gender into account for example or

352
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
culture as i should

353
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
but no i wasn't going to i wanted to

354
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
make an ai that was as bad as the one

355
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
you would find in industry because i

356
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
want to show how bad it was

357
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
but yeah again the first choice i made

358
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
was already to say it

359
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
then the question became what data

360
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,360
should i use to train my ai

361
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
and

362
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
i had all these photos on my hard drive

363
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
now from all this downloading from

364
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
github including a huge number of

365
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
chinese celebrities

366
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
and a lot of these arrest records i

367
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,079
thought i could i could work with those

368
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,920
two

369
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,519
and yeah so this kind of what you get

370
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
you get these huge excel sheets with

371
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,560
those photos full of all the names of

372
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,959
the photos as well as the bmi scores

373
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,839
um

374
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,880
and

375
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
here like i said this is the one from

376
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
the arrest records and there in the top

377
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,079
right you can see someone was

378
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
holding location was cherokee mental

379
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
health so that's i think is a pretty

380
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
serious data violation anyway

381
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
then the question becomes in what way do

382
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
i mix these these photos like what would

383
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,639
that do to my algorithm and that was

384
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,480
really interesting to to try this in

385
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
different

386
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
ratios to see what happens if i made my

387
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
algorithm with more chinese celebrities

388
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,279
or with more arrest records

389
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
and it turned out this had a really big

390
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
influence here you see my my training

391
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
itself

392
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,079
uh

393
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,759
it really had this surprised me how big

394
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
the influence was if i put in more

395
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,600
chinese people the outcomes of my ai

396
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
were vastly different than if i used

397
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,120
more arrest records so this was really

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
an important one

399
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,399
in the end i decided to just go for 50

400
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,920
50.

401
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
i want to make again a universal

402
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,639
ai so i thought i'd just mix it 50 50 i

403
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,759
didn't really have a preference there

404
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
another question that i came to was will

405
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
i massage the data

406
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,839
so

407
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,199
when you look at all the data points

408
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,240
that i had

409
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,800
um there were some people who

410
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
i'm hesitant to say were just had

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
strange faces you know they were they

412
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,759
were a little bit off in the data set

413
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
they were outliers that you will always

414
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,759
get when you get a data set like this

415
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,680
and then i came to the same problem that

416
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
a lot of people who make these ai

417
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
systems have which is

418
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,680
will i remove these

419
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
these strange people or not do i remove

420
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,360
the outliers because that has a big

421
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,720
effect again on the ai

422
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
because when they were in there i got

423
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
this lopsided graph where the majority

424
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,839
of people

425
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,800
spaces would be measured less precisely

426
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
because the algorithm was also taking

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
account these very rare people

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
so here you see the original data and

429
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
this is what happens when i remove the

430
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
outliers you see that it becomes a lot

431
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,959
more

432
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
precise for the majority

433
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,260
at the cost of not having

434
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,680
[Music]

435
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
any data about the majority right so

436
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,360
these these people are

437
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
are gone

438
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
um

439
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,079
so what's the big picture how well does

440
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
this work

441
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,800
well here you see um the prediction

442
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
error distribution

443
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
before and after i removed those

444
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,439
outliers so what you see here is is

445
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
i know from all these photos what the

446
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,880
score should be

447
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
and here you see how many points it was

448
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
wrong from what it should be so if it

449
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
should be 14

450
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,000
a large group of people the score was

451
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,319
only two points off from what it should

452
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
be so that's that's kind of good

453
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
um and then when i remove those outliers

454
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
you see the at the bottom it became even

455
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
better so most people it was close to

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
but interestingly

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
when i had those outliers included the

458
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
maximum error that you could get is that

459
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
you would 14 points of bmi score wrong

460
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
so there might have been someone with a

461
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
score of 20 who got 34 somehow

462
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
but when i removed those outliers the

463
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
people who the system had never seen

464
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
before who were now also shown to it the

465
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
system just had no idea what to do with

466
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
it so it got outliers that well it went

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
all the way up to 20 bmi points

468
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,360
difference so here you see a trade-off

469
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
that i'm making that by removing those

470
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
strange faces those outliers the effect

471
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,919
is that the system works better for the

472
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
majority of people

473
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
but i'm screwing over those people in

474
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,039
the majority even more

475
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
right so those are very real uh choices

476
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
i'm making that that very much relate to

477
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,160
issues in society right about inclusion

478
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
and stuff like that so

479
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
yeah you see it literally reflected in

480
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
the ai

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
in general you could say that with these

482
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
algorithms you have that for a large

483
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,080
group of people the algorithm is is good

484
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
and accurate then for a second tier it's

485
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
okay and it goes all the way down until

486
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
you have about a third to 40 of people

487
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
for which you could say the algorithm is

488
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
not accurate at all or even very wrong

489
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
and this is kind of the graph that you

490
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
have with every ai right every ai will

491
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
work well for a certain group of people

492
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
and screw over a small group of other

493
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
people

494
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
so as i said this was about design

495
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
choices that i made

496
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
do i go for more gender-specific or do i

497
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
go make a unisex one do i make it

498
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
culture-specific do i make a universal

499
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
one do i make it scientific or not et

500
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
cetera

501
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
and what you can say is these are

502
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
basically trade-offs that i'm making

503
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,200
there is no way to make a perfect ai for

504
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
this i'm always making trade-offs where

505
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,880
if i'm making it better for one group i

506
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,320
will make it worse for the other and

507
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
vice versa i cannot make a perfect face

508
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
recognition ai in this case that's a

509
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,520
very important thing to understand that

510
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
these systems will never be perfect

511
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,559
there will always be trade-offs here

512
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,960
when you design this

513
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,559
well how well does it work as we saw it

514
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
it doesn't work very well right so as

515
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
with a lot of these things in this in

516
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
this

517
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
documentary you'll know that you'll feel

518
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,039
like oh my god this system got me

519
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
totally wrong but well yeah that's the

520
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,200
point these systems are used on you

521
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,160
every day and you don't even realize it

522
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,400
more importantly they're often wrong

523
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
right but they're um

524
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
a right often enough to make it

525
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
financially interesting for a lot of

526
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,080
companies to use these if your face

527
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
recognition ai is right 60 of the time

528
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
that's already better than tossing a

529
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
coin so it's valuable

530
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
so why are these algorithms that are

531
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
basically not working well

532
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
so popular like so as i said one thing

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
is is a financial aspect but i think

534
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,919
another one that we don't really talk

535
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,080
enough about is accountability right one

536
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,159
of the reasons you use an ai is to be

537
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,200
able to say

538
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
i didn't make that judgment

539
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,120
the ai made that judgment right it's a

540
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
way to offload your responsibility or to

541
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
evaporate your responsibility by being

542
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,120
able to point to

543
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
uh something code and give it the blame

544
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,200
which i think is is a powerful incentive

545
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
for a lot of organizations to use ai

546
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
there's also a lot of things that i

547
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,679
didn't put in this system but that are

548
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
being used like

549
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
guessing whether or not you are gay

550
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
based on your face it's a thing

551
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
there are some companies who go even

552
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,679
further

553
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,799
claiming to predict whether or not

554
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,799
you're a terrorist based on your face

555
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
and of course one that i could have

556
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,679
literally put in here because i had the

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,240
algorithm but i didn't was ethnicity so

558
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,919
you can find out or try you know they

559
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,120
claim to be able to find out some

560
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,440
ethnicity based on your face

561
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,320
but that's again often wrong

562
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
so what's my point with all this well i

563
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
hope to to make clear that technology is

564
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
definitely not neutral right these ais

565
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,799
are not neutral they are designed

566
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,120
um i make a lot of choices when i make

567
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
it and those choices are great

568
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,559
trade-offs it will never be a perfect

569
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
algorithm it will always make trade-offs

570
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,799
and benefit some groups and and harm

571
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,760
others

572
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
so again what this means is that

573
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,520
technology is political right that's of

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
course what you all understand but

575
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
it is technology is about choices and

576
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
choices are by definition political

577
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
because it's something you can discuss

578
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,320
together say hey why do you make that

579
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,559
choice why did you use this data or that

580
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
data that methodology or that one

581
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,559
something we can discuss and that means

582
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
that we can

583
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
hopefully hold it accountable

584
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
and uh i hope that this talk can help us

585
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
uh yeah understand that how this works

586
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
how the sausage is made in some of this

587
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,039
stuff and we can all keep this stuff

588
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,880
accountable thank you very much that was

589
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
my talk hope you enjoyed it

590
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
well thank you so much i learned a lot

591
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,000
it was super interesting i'm glad you

592
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
liked it

593
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
and if there are any people with

594
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
questions there are mics in the path in

595
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
the middle

596
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
so

597
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
if you want to know anything i think of

598
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,120
course they can approach you after if

599
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
they come up with something smart

600
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,640
but

601
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,760
if there are any questions now

602
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
go for it

603
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,000
thank you for your interesting talk

604
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
you've based your algorithm on face

605
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,320
recognition would it help if you would

606
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,799
extend your bmi prediction algorithm to

607
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,679
the entire body for example

608
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,520
that's a good question yeah i only found

609
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
one project on github that even tried

610
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
that interestingly enough

611
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,760
so

612
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
you would expect so yeah but

613
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
um

614
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,520
again i don't think uh even if you do

615
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
that that that will create a perfect bmi

616
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,200
prediction algorithm since that's just

617
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,799
not possible it'll still make mistakes

618
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,400
so but yeah i think that's interesting

619
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
why that's not it seems as if they all

620
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
just follow the same uh follow the

621
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
leader you know like there's one

622
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,520
algorithm that tries it and it uses

623
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
these seven ratios i think it was a

624
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,360
chinese project that did that

625
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
and then just everybody starts jumping

626
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,720
on the bandwagon using the same

627
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,159
technique and it just becomes the

628
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,679
standard somehow

629
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,919
yeah

630
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,280
okay thank you

631
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,159
there is an initiative about banning

632
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,840
facial recognition what do you think

633
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,090
about that i'm a part of it

634
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,520
[Music]

635
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
i created another project if you like

636
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,600
this one there's another project i made

637
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,039
in the part of the reclaim your face

638
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,240
campaign that you're talking about i

639
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
think

640
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
which is a game where you can try to

641
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,279
not be recognized by the ai and of

642
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
course why can't i think of the url

643
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,159
right now

644
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,240
i'll uh um if you want i can tell you

645
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
later what the url is but yeah i think

646
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,520
we should ban face recognition and

647
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
technology in public space absolutely

648
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,240
the the consortium the ai consortium i

649
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,000
was part of for the european union this

650
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,080
was one of our recommendations actually

651
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
was one of the recommendations that i

652
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,160
had a big hand in so

653
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,039
[Music]

654
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,200
thank you

655
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
hello thanks for the talk um from a more

656
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,559
political standpoint standpoint

657
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
um are we to expect the european union

658
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,880
to put enough safeguards in place to

659
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,360
kind of balance this out

660
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,279
i hope so i mean i'm just an artist

661
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,159
working

662
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,840
who works on the european union research

663
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
project so i'm not the european union um

664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
but i mean yeah i'm glad i live in the

665
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
european union

666
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,679
because at least we're trying to do this

667
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,080
stuff sure enough yeah yeah okay thank

668
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
you

669
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,039
yeah sorry if i missed this i was

670
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
sitting in abacus um waiting for the

671
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,200
talk to start so i missed most of it

672
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
i'd be interested in um

673
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
the validation of ai software do you um

674
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,000
do you deal with that did you deal it

675
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,480
with that in your talk sorry because i

676
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
come from from medical software and we

677
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
were talking ai you have to validate

678
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
everything make sure that there is no

679
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
risk in this software

680
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
what do you think about that are there

681
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,320
strategies how would you do that well i

682
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,200
mean basically my talk was to show one

683
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
strategy of doing that

684
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,880
by going by going to github and just

685
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
looking at what is out there and looking

686
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
at all these projects and seeing what

687
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
people are doing

688
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
basically this gives you a look under

689
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
the hood of the car and see oh so this

690
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,679
is how they're doing the bmi stuff

691
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,320
mostly this is what's normal and then

692
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,240
you just you know you're just amazed at

693
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
how how much duct tape is involved and

694
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
uh yeah so this is a way to audit that

695
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,039
in the sense that i'm now telling you

696
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,320
don't trust these bmi prediction

697
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
algorithms they're just held together by

698
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
duct tape basically yeah okay yeah thank

699
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
you i will definitely re-watch

700
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,760
all right

701
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,829
[Music]

702
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
yes yes

703
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,320
i basically have two questions

704
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
first one

705
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,799
have you

706
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
planned any further extensions of this

707
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,320
ai

708
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,559
i think you can remember that

709
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,440
and the second question is

710
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,039
in what ways do you

711
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,039
promote a

712
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,320
new upcoming projects to use this ai or

713
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,799
wouldn't you promote it

714
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
oh i would promote it um oh by the way i

715
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
just remember the name so if you want

716
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
more of this you can go to ru.eu

717
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
which is the game where you can try to

718
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,720
hide your face and your first question

719
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,480
was um if if i would extend the project

720
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,360
and um that's a good question

721
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
i'm not going to extend this because one

722
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
of the issues with the project that i

723
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,919
had looking back is that a lot of people

724
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
still took

725
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
the predictions my system made at face

726
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,679
value and the message that you cannot

727
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,200
trust these systems that are very wonky

728
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
didn't come across

729
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
well often enough so if i would do it

730
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,600
another time what i would do is

731
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
something different

732
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
which is that i would

733
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,360
let a number of different ais judge your

734
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,200
face at the same time and then you can

735
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,799
see that they all create a different

736
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,840
prediction

737
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
so for example this beauty algorithm

738
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,960
that was in this one

739
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
is made in china which means it will

740
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,559
give a higher score to people who look

741
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,600
chinese

742
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,880
right for example johnny depp is way

743
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,320
more popular in china than george

744
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
clooney because he has more chinese-like

745
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,840
features

746
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
so

747
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,159
but when you get it like a chinese

748
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,240
beauty algorithm any western one and an

749
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,600
indian one then you will be able to see

750
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
hey this really is cultured

751
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,679
i should ask the question which ai is

752
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
judging me at the moment who made it

753
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
which culture was it trained on

754
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,480
um that matters a lot so

755
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
if i would do it again i would do that

756
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,039
i'll give you like a judge panel in the

757
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,039
kind of a tv show kind of thing yeah

758
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
thank you

759
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
uh yeah next

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,880
okay

761
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
i wanted to ask what did you do

762
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,559
technically like how did you do the

763
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,919
classifications was it a neural network

764
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,480
or just some svm or

765
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
it was a i used um

766
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
javascript uh google's javascript tensor

767
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,919
stuff so i it was the thing you saw the

768
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,080
animation that was in the browser so

769
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,080
um i used very basic uh um just uh

770
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
normal training of uh

771
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,360
that answer your question already

772
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,480
i'm not i'm not so it was

773
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,559
fine tuned on

774
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
uh fine-tuned on fingerprints that you

775
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,640
extracted i guess

776
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
yeah then just some single layers yeah

777
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,919
so my algorithm took extracted those 68

778
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,520
phase points as well

779
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,399
then calculated all those phase ratios

780
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
and then did the normal regression type

781
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,799
thing and tried to find uh yeah it tried

782
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,919
to do the same thing that i saw in the

783
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,480
examples basically and then just

784
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,640
would spit out a prediction based on on

785
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
what it saw before what it learned

786
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,399
okay it's a very simple very simple one

787
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,960
yeah i noticed uh one of the data sets

788
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,679
that was used is celebrities and

789
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
celebrities quite often have a plastic

790
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,520
surgery

791
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,399
um

792
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,080
did you also come across a plastic

793
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
surgery detection algorithm

794
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
no i didn't no well i mean i didn't look

795
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,080
for it either so but that would be a

796
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
good that would be an interesting github

797
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,080
safari to try for sure yeah yeah i mean

798
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,000
there are a lot of interesting things

799
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
and what i found so interesting about

800
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,360
github for example is that

801
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,840
for chinese china has copies of their

802
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
own platforms for a lot of things right

803
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
they have their own whatsapp they have

804
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,039
their own whatever but china chinese

805
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,520
programmers still use github a lot

806
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
so it's a unique insight into what

807
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
chinese programmers think is is okay

808
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,760
and so

809
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
in the india and china are so highly

810
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,679
represented in my data that it's just

811
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,360
uni interesting to find out what they

812
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,159
consider acceptable and ethical which is

813
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
as you saw at the very first slides

814
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,279
they're not very precise about this

815
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,919
stuff at all it's it's really um

816
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,600
duct tape and

817
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,559
i think that's interesting one

818
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,919
interesting thing about this is this the

819
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,720
insight into chinese practices

820
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,520
thank you you're welcome

821
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
okay thank you i think we'll be rounding

822
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
up the q a i don't see any more

823
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
questions but if you come up with a

824
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
question

825
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
i think they can approach you of course

826
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
and ask anything well thank you for the

827
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,200
amazing talk i think we all thoroughly

828
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,100
enjoyed it and another big applause

829
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:36,350
[Applause]

830
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,439
you
