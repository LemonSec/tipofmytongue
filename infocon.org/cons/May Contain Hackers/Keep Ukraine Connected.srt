00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,640
so global knock alliance gna

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
is a foundation to help

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
network operators they started by

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,880
helping them organize meetups but since

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
the war in ukraine they also provide

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
donated equipment to keep the internet

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
running in the country

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
um so

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,640

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,680

so um yeah welcome um so keep ukraine

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
connected uh is a task force of

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
why does this always work except when

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,690
you're

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,680
[Music]

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
i'm too far away apparently

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
so it's a task force of the global knock

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
alliance um

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
we just started uh doing stuff for the

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
network community um

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
nogs are operator groups they get

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
usually get together

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
exchange knowledge help each other out

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
things like that and we were just

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
supporting them hosting their websites

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
hosting their email just making their

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
life a bit easier

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,720
um

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,759
but then

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
the war in ukraine happened

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,439
so

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,240
we are all like

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
very close together the the network

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
operator community is quite a close

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
community

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
so our

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,439
board member our chair

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,880
actually wrote drove a truck to ukraine

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
um

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
to help them out with humanitarian good

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
and then he was like well if we can do

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
this for with humanitarian goods

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
why don't we help the network people

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
over there

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,840
so

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
this is the picture of

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
of how it started

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
just two trucks full of relief goods in

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,239
the in march

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
but yeah this was not enough

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
so

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,520
um

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,920
[Music]

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,040
how

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,959
does this actually

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,480
work

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
bringing a goods to uh

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
to ukraine um

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
with a truck

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
the biggest problem is actually the

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
border crossing

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
um

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
you still you stand there for hours in a

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
queue

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
so

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
after the first trip we had a board

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
meeting

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
and we decided

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,959
we started task force keep ukraine

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,840
connected

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,760
now you know what do you do um my

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
girlfriend is a designer so she designed

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
the logo we registered a website we're

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
like oh let's just ask some people

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
for help

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
so what what do we do well we we need to

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,360
help the the people in ukraine

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,239
and

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
we have contacts in the whole community

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,519
so i'm sure we can get something

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
together and this was just a very

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
you know

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,319
just an uh what in one weekend what can

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
we do

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
um

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
but this got bigger and bigger really

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
really fast so

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
we made a little

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
application web base where people from

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,319
ukraine could register what they need

95
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
we would register all the donations

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
uh there

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
um and actually since then we

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,879
we made multiple uh deliveries so

99
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
my friend alright said like oh you start

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
you start as a network engineer and

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
three weeks later it turns out you're a

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
supply chain manager

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,599
um

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
yeah so we uh we have the database we're

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
figuring out what everybody needs what

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,959
everybody

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
is is donating

108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,879
and this is a lot so

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,200
we started out with a little uh

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,519
you know just a little idea

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
um but then our phone didn't stop

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
ringing people kept donating stuff we

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,799
got from a big us it donated

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,358
pallets and pallets of equipment we got

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,160
donations from all around

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
europe

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
it's been completely crazy

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
so yeah we have our article database um

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
because we don't want to

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
just drive some junk to ukraine it's

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
like here is some hundred megabit uh

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,160
ethernet hubs have fun bye

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
you know we actually want to do

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,240
something that that helps them so people

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
can put from uk can actually put in

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
these are the things we need

127
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,919
so

128
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,440
a donor can

129
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
can can see what's in the system

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
the requester can see what's in the

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
system

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
and we actually work together with the

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
ministry in ukraine

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,639
and we have a lot of help from a company

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
called deps

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,880
deps is actually a distributor like it's

137
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
usually their business to to sell

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
hardware but in the war they uh they

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
actually work together with the internet

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,199
association

141
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
and they uh

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
are now doing all of this work for free

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
we ship all the donated equipment to

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
them they will actually clean it up

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
repackage it check it ship it out to all

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
the parties in the in ukraine

147
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
and we now have people uh like in actual

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
war zones using this equipment

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,919
so why are we doing this

150
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
well

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
ukraine is

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
some people are like oh ukraine sounds

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
like a third world country we don't know

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
much about it

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
um

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
but no like the the vast majority of

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
people had internet access

158
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,039
um

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
they uh

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
they have a lot of uh

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
people on online i i read the other day

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
that like the average bandwidth a person

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
has a 60 megabits

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
they have a very large fiber to the home

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,919
deployments

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,720
so yeah so when the war started internet

167
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,319
became even more important to them

168
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,600
so

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
you can see how uh uh

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
how did how the trends uh uh uh go like

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
the the line go

172
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
shows where the where the invasion

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
started and suddenly um

174
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
non-ukrainian non-russian apps are being

175
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,159
downloaded a lot

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
and this is what they uh uh

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
the the working conditions they have in

178
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
like i tell people like if i ever

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
complain about my working conditions

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
again let me take a look at this picture

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
because on the left here that's an

182
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
exploded tank

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,919
and the

184
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,000
sitting there is uh

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,919
welding some fibers using a fiber

186
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
splicer to to fix some some backbone

187
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
links

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,479
this is this is crazy

189
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,440
um

190
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,919
yeah it turns out that fiber connections

191
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,280
and tanks and bombs are not really

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
compatible

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
so this is what they uh what they do a

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
lot now they

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
they they actually have to find the

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
fight the broken fibers um use tools to

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
measure fiber is broken

198
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,840
um

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
and then fix it

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
but yeah it's

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,960
a lot of times bridges are used for a

202
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
fiber across because

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
a bridge is

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
obviously like if you're especially if

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
you're using water it's a very

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,759
convenient way to get your fiber across

207
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,919
but yeah everything is completely

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,919
destroyed

209
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
and then you're standing there and you

210
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,720
actually need

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
military staff protecting you because

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,080
these pictures are actually taken

213
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
in

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
uh turkey and uh donetsk and this is

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
actually still a war zone they're trying

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
to fix the internet while the war is

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,840
still going on in that region so it's

218
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,119
actually quite dangerous work as well

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah this is uh

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,639
this is a a bit of a of a server rack or

221
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
a data center

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
cell towers being destroyed

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
so yeah so this was the these are

224
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,479
pictures from the the first run to uh uh

225
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,759
to ukraine

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
um we loaded up stuff uh and uh renee

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
the guy in the left picture

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
he uh drove a truck from berlin via

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
prague to ljubljana which is like all

230
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
the way south uh

231
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
in europe and then uh stayed there for a

232
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
day then drove back to poland uh and

233
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
then crossed into ukraine to actually

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,360
deliver all the stuff we have pallets of

235
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
of servers fiber splicers switches

236
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
um

237
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
and yeah but like i said the most

238
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
difficult bit is actually the custom

239
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,480
skew

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,880
if you're driving a truck that means

241
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
that you stand in that queue like i

242
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
think he arrived in the queue at 11 in

243
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,560
the morning and finally uh made it to

244
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
the front of the queue at seven in the

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
evening you know just standing there for

246
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
eight hours just queuing

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
but then eight hours later

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
the white truck was

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
from our side

250
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
from uh from depths

251
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
so they just put them back to back and

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,760
loaded everything up

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
and

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
this was

255
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
our first deliver

256
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
but then

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
what next our working on the whole

258
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
supply chain um we wrote

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
the tools we're still looking for people

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
to help out with all of this

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,240
um because yeah it's still a lot of work

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,839
so

263
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
what are we currently working on

264
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
well

265
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
we are still looking for for more donors

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,600
especially

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
the high-end isp network gear

268
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,079
but we're also looking for uh

269
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
for partners to uh to work with us

270
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,440
especially in the

271
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
in in the logistics

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,399
um

273
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
governments are very hard to work with

274
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
because

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
they work on a completely different

276
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
level they

277
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,399
talk to

278
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
people uh uh

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
from the massive the big isps you know

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
the uh the national telcos

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
um the ones that uh uh

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
that are

283
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
like multi multi-million dollar

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
companies

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
um

286
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
except ukraine has a lot of smaller

287
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
isps

288
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
um i don't know uh if you're like when i

289
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,519
started working on the internet in 95

290
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
every town had its own isp like there

291
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
was lots of diversity lots of smaller

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
companies working together

293
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
and

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
everything got bought up and centralized

295
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
and now every country has just a handful

296
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,760
of isps

297
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
but ukraine is still at the

298
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
at the point where they have small isps

299
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
that just have 10 000 users or 50 000

300
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
users

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
and that actually made them really

302
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
really resilient

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
um but the downside is is that

304
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
nobody has a good view of who needs help

305
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
so as you as you saw in the

306
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
in the pictures

307
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
they have a lot of broken fiber so one

308
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
of the things we're doing is we're

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
using all the donated money to buy

310
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
splicing equipment

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
to fix those fibers to

312
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
to measure where the errors are stuff

313
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
like that

314
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,959
except this is not cheap equipment

315
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,600
if you have a professional fiber splicer

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
yeah i i say it's about nine ten

317
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,279
thousand euros per splicer

318
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,000
um we i think we still have like a

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
request for 40 of them outstanding so

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
um we're still looking for a lot lots of

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
donations there

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
um

323
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
of course my screen goes to sleep i'm

324
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
sorry

325
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
um

326
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,760
so yes

327
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
we're collecting money we're collecting

328
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
equipment and we actually have multiple

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
uh trips uh going to uh to ukraine we

330
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
have volunteers in poland volunteers in

331
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,680
germany

332
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
who just spend their own time they're

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
not getting paid

334
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
driving around in their van collecting

335
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
equipment bringing it to ukraine so it's

336
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
it's a really impressive

337
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
effort

338
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,279
and of course all this all this

339
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
volunteering work

340
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
um

341
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
is

342
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,839
is not something we get paid for this is

343
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
something we do in our spare time so we

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
have our day jobs we have our families

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
um and this is yeah

346
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
basically just a hobby

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
so

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
and as as usual hobbies are very

349
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
expensive

350
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
so yeah who's who's who's behind the uh

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,959
all this

352
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,920
well

353
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
um there's current pre-chart is actually

354
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
sitting right over there

355
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
she does a lot of communication and

356
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
design for us natalie trenham and

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,040
works at ripe ncc she's

358
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
uh she's helping a lot basically when

359
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,360
she when she started helping out she

360
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
said i will help you but i'll kick your

361
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,639
butt

362
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
because you are way too disorganized and

363
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
you need somebody to tell you what to do

364
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
and we were like yes please please tell

365
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,160
us what to do we have no idea what we're

366
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
doing

367
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
so she's she's the one who's uh who's

368
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,399
helping us structure everything

369
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
um well it's a there's me

370
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120

good friend of mine from slovenia

372
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,079
then we have

373
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
rene fishmueller

374
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
he works for flex optics and he he's the

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,480
one who drove the first truck to to

376
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
ukraine

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
eric bise is helping us a lot

378
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
and actually he sponsored uh uh him and

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
his business uh partners sponsored two

380
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
tents here at uh mch and they're

381
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
actually right next to the music stage

382
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,920
where we are uh

383
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,519
collecting uh hardware for ukraine or

384
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
collecting donations and then

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
the proceeds from that go to ukraine so

386
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
he's helping us a lot especially at this

387
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
event

388
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
and then the next one danielle and

389
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,480
martin those are two volunteers who

390
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
are driving all the fans back and forth

391
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,760
with all

392
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,720
with all the equipment

393
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
so we also have a lot of help from

394
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
ukraine like because like i said we

395
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
don't just want to be one of those

396
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
charities who just collect junk and dump

397
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
it over the border

398
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
we actually want to know what they need

399
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
before we send stuff

400
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
so we have people from the associations

401
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
of internet providers we have people

402
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
from the association of um

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
digital rights copyright stuff like that

404
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
um we have people at deps the

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
distributor

406
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
and maybe good to point out that

407
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
distributor wasn't chosen by us

408
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
they were chosen by the ukrainian

409
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
internet providers

410
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
so we're trying to do it

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,240
as

412
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
their way as much as we can we're not

413
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
telling them what we're going to do we

414
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
actually ask them what they want us to

415
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
do

416
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,040
so

417
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
this way we

418
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,519
we talk to people at the different

419
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
associations distributors um

420
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
and make sure that people in ukraine

421
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
actually get what they

422
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,639
need a whole load of sponsors

423
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
nope and there i'm going too fast

424
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
and this is actually

425
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,800
something we're

426
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,399
working on

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
at the moment is to get those splicers

428
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,920
like i said they are insanely expensive

429
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
um we actually got a very good deal we

430
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
usually uh

431
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,680
get them about half the usual price so

432
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
we're actually talking to the

433
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
distributors to the manufacturers

434
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
and we get them

435
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
for

436
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,320
about 5000 for a really professional

437
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
splicer

438
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,639
so

439
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,880
this this slide is a bit outdated we got

440
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
a we got some more splices now

441
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
especially because last week we got a

442
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
massive donation so we we just put in

443
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,040
some some more uh

444
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
orders

445
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
um

446
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
but yeah the uh if you if you look at

447
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
the right the um

448
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,800
the

449
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
the splices that are really good for

450
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
like long distance trunks uh we need

451
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
about 20 of those

452
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
and for the the fiber to the home

453
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,800
because there's a lot of smaller isps

454
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
we're actually looking

455
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,279
at about needing 40 of those

456
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
so even though we're getting quite some

457
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,560
donations we're not there by a long shot

458
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,759
um what else are we uh doing well

459
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,000
like us we're getting donations from big

460
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
companies

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
um for the network engineers in the room

462
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,240
we're actually getting juniper mx 2010s

463
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,559
and mx960s donated

464
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
so

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,000
yeah this is not

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
cheap hardware that's a couple of

467
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
decades old this is actually quite quite

468
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
decent hardware for lots of 10 gig and

469
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,599
100 gig links

470
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
so yeah so

471
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,640
not all of that is necessary

472
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
right now

473
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
so one of the things when i said we were

474
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,840
looking for partners to work with

475
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
is actually finding warehouses where we

476
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
can store stuff

477
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
um most of the people who donate

478
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
equipment say oh if you can't use it

479
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
then sell it and use the money to buy

480
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
something you can use

481
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
except that

482
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,590
oh that's cute

483
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,600
[Laughter]

484
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,960
always happens when you're presenting

485
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
right

486
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
um

487
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
so yeah so um the problem is the moment

488
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
we ship it uh into ukraine

489
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
um we can't get it back anymore we can't

490
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
go like oh we shipped it to ukraine but

491
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
they can't actually use it so at that

492
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,679
point we can't ship it back into europe

493
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
and then try to sell it and buy

494
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
something else for them

495
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,799
so one of the problems we're having at

496
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,000
the moment is

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
where do we store

498
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,000
the hardware that's donated but not

499
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,960
necessary or not yet necessary

500
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
so we can sell it and and get some get

501
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,320
something else

502
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
um those are actually quite hard

503
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
problems because

504
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,799
um

505
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,039
the logistics companies around the world

506
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,919
are in a really bad shape at the moment

507
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,799
um

508
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,760
we actually

509
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
saw that this week when we were trying

510
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
to get the banners for the uh for the

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
tents next to the music stage

512
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
um they got delivered to the wrong

513
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
address they uh uh they were actually

514
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
late

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,480
and um we did a uh

516
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,200
like a expedited order for the stickers

517
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,559
we got

518
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
about to keep ukraine connected

519
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
and we got a notification that they

520
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
would be delivered on monday

521
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,160
so

522
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,960
we actually drove to the ups depot in

523
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
hovdov earlier today to get the stickers

524
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
out of the supply chain because

525
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
ups couldn't actually deliver them on

526
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,559
time

527
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,320
so yeah we have stickers at the 10.

528
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
yeah but you can you can see how how

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
much trouble all the logistics companies

530
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,120
are having so um being able to actually

531
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
uh store some some large equipment for a

532
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
longer time

533
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
um

534
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,919
for example those if you're talking

535
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,640
about those big routers um

536
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,799
a lot of data centers got destroyed like

537
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,080
we uh

538
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
we regularly get videos from one of the

539
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,760
isps where the data center is just

540
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,960
burning

541
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,840
um

542
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
that's not something they're going to

543
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
fix in the short term then short term

544
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
they're just going to need some

545
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
some emergency backups some connections

546
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,559
but maybe

547
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,240
half a year from now or a year from now

548
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
when the war comes down and hopefully

549
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
ukraine is in a better shape

550
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
then they'll need some some of that

551
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
equipment so that's some of the logistic

552
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,559
problems

553
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
we're still working on

554
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
and like i said the other one is

555
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
political customs

556
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
when i said you're standing it for eight

557
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
hours in that queue to even get to the

558
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
front of the queue to uh uh to talk to

559
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
customs

560
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,799
um if you're in uh and we're leaving

561
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,760
through poland you need a stack of paper

562
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
just

563
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
to document what you're exporting that

564
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
you have export permission because

565
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
network gear has encryption software so

566
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,679
it's dual use goods so you have to have

567
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,919
export licenses and all that kind of

568
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
stuff

569
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,640
um

570
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
so of course you need all this paperwork

571
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
and then you have to export it declare

572
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,480
that you're providing this as

573
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
humanitarian aid

574
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,200
and then you're

575
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
at the border talking to a customs guy

576
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,679
who is like this isn't humanitarian aid

577
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
this is equipment network equipment

578
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,960
like yes internet is important for

579
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
people so like we they need it because

580
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
of that detroit

581
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
and our first shipment almost got sent

582
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,960
back we actually were looking for

583
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
warehouses to store the stuff

584
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
because uh

585
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
one guy at the customs

586
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
was not sure that he would allow this

587
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
through out of poland

588
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
luckily everything worked but it's

589
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
sometimes quite hard to convince people

590
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
that this is also important from a

591
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
humanitarian point of view

592
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
on the ukrainian side things are a lot

593
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,360
easier you send the paperwork in advance

594
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
they give you a qr code you go to the

595
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
custom scan the qr code and you're

596
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
basically good to go

597
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
so it's actually really impressive what

598
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,760
the ukrainians have uh have done there

599
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
um so yeah so um

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
oh i forgot to tell you about that a bit

601
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,159
um

602
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,720
what we also are shipping a lot is

603
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,640
power over ethernet switches and wi-fi

604
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
access points

605
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
um to help people in the bomb shelters

606
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
because

607
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,559
people have to shelter from all the all

608
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
the violence

609
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,400
um and the internet is the only way they

610
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,679
can keep

611
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,280
connected cell towers are being

612
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,799
destroyed mobile networks are being

613
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,000
taken over

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
so um

615
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
for people to have free internet access

616
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
so they can actually facetime their

617
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
family and tell everybody they're okay

618
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
is is really important so that's also

619
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,080
one of the uh things we're working on

620
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,320
and it just shows how from you like i

621
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
said from humanitarian perspective how

622
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,679
important

623
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,240
it is to to help to help people get

624
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
proper internet access

625
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
i'm actually talking way too fast

626
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,799
because that was my last slide

627
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
so i guess we have some more time for

628
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
questions

629
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
okay so first question is do you

630
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
prioritize in uh infrastructure to

631
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,600
mobile towers

632
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,679
um actually no

633
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,240
um what we see a lot is that the mobile

634
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
towers and the cell companies are

635
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,120
getting a lot of help through the

636
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,679
government um there is there are

637
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,360
international warehouses shipping stuff

638
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
to the ukrainian government who then

639
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
distributes it

640
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
and you often hear people say like oh

641
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
but you know the internet in ukraine is

642
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
fine

643
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
but yeah then you're talking about the

644
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
multi-million dollar companies

645
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
um but because there are so many smaller

646
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,799
companies um

647
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,919
that is uh where the the major pain is

648
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,720
so what we do is we send it to debs in

649
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,720
ukraine

650
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
they actually

651
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
keep a list of who is providing service

652
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
like i said there's a lot of fiber to

653
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,559
the home

654
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,000
so um

655
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
they say okay you know we're we're now

656
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
first making

657
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
every isp

658
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,520
at least

659
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
one fiber splicer to fix the the

660
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
connections to people's homes

661
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,320
so we're more focusing on that than on

662
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
the really large companies in the cell

663
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
towers

664
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,440
can i can i ask a question

665
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
oh repeat yeah does it answer your

666
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
question

667
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
um i think it's super impressive what

668
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
you guys are doing

669
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,279
um

670
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,080
really really nice um and what i really

671
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
like is the tool you built

672
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,840
to combine questions and available

673
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,960
supply

674
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,679
and i was wondering and if you would be

675
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,000
willing to open-source it it already is

676
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
it already is perfect

677
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,720
no it's i'm so happy because like i said

678
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
they started just as a small project

679
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,919
like oh let's see if we can get some

680
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,360
stuff for ukraine

681
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,440
and i'm really happy that i wrote that

682
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
tool in the first couple of weeks

683
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,799
because after that i wouldn't have had

684
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
the energy to do it anymore

685
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,960
no i understand that but no it's on the

686
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
uh it's on github slash knock alliance

687
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
and the the tool is over there perfect

688
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
we're going to use it for supplies to

689
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
the front in khakis

690
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,080
and if you need any assistance with the

691
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
logistics we've managed to solve many of

692
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
the headaches you have

693
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
so let's drink a beer afterwards that

694
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
sounds like an excellent plan

695
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,760
thanks for the question thank you um do

696
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
we have any questions from the uh from

697
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,440
the internet

698
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,320
yeah

699
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
canary no questions yeah yeah go ahead

700
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,240
go ahead

701
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
did the low orbit satellite stuff from

702
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
musk help

703
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,279
that's a

704
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,840
that's a very good question um so

705
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
what we understood is that most of the

706
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
of those connections first went to the

707
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,520
the government and military and uh

708
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,039
those offices

709
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,840
um

710
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,919
one of the things uh and i spoke to um

711
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,000
what's her name like a

712
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
reporter some frontiers as a style

713
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,039
organization and they were actually very

714
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,279
careful uh with this

715
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,120
because russians have uh uh missiles

716
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,559
that that home in on satellite signals

717
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
so one of the things they said is if you

718
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
use those uh starlink dishes

719
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
put them far away from you

720
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,279
put them there

721
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
walk away then turn them on use them for

722
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
a short time and then turn them off wait

723
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
a few minutes then go pick them up

724
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,480
i understood that they have very long uh

725
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
ethernet cables

726
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,600
yeah

727
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
they better have yeah i uh i heard from

728
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
the the reporters that they said it

729
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,320
actually happened that um reporters had

730
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,520
uh satellite phones and were

731
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
doing like live broadcasts from ukraine

732
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,279
and speaking on that phone for half an

733
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,720
hour that's a very dangerous thing to do

734
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,320
don't do that

735
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,440
next question is is there any way we can

736
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,320
talk to the polish government about the

737
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,559
uh the the

738
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
border control of your stuff

739
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,480
can we

740
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
put any pressure

741
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
from here

742
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,919
we are talking to people from the from

743
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,679
the eu we have some connections in

744
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,799
poland it's also difficult uh because

745
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
you can talk to the officials

746
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,240
but the guy standing at the border

747
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
doesn't know anything

748
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,399
so getting that right is is is a bit

749
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,880
tricky but uh we're definitely working

750
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
on getting better paperwork to convince

751
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
them

752
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,919
and the last question is

753
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,679
using the military supplies for for guns

754
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,559
and blah blah blah to to shift your

755
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
stuff also there

756
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,120
we haven't is that possible

757
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,200
i i don't know we uh

758
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,640
we tried to

759
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,919
focus on the more humanitarian side of

760
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
what's needed than on the military side

761
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
so we haven't spoken to the military a

762
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,679
lot in the beginning we uh

763
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,600
we asked like oh we want to help network

764
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,279
engineers what do you need and we've got

765
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,480
a list of like bulletproof vests and

766
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
that that's not our thing you know what

767
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
i mean but using them for transport use

768
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,000
their logistics yeah

769
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
thanks for the question another question

770
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,120
for him

771
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,159
hello yeah so i have a question i just

772
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,960
reminded like it a bit picks up on one

773
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
the um the things that the person in

774
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
front of me said

775
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,919
um you said that you have problems with

776
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,480
warehouses uh did you also try with the

777
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,559
military because for example this are

778
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
noted in slovenia military

779
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,440
does have a lot of warehouses

780
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,480
they also um make it available to

781
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,279
certain organizations mostly

782
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,279
i personally it's for scouts i don't

783
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,360
know if the military wants to meddle

784
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,320
these things in a in an official way

785
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,279
but have you tried that and

786
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,000
yeah

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,559
we haven't we should thank you

788
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,679
cool

789
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,480
thanks for the question

790
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
uh yeah so my question would be like

791
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,279
what do the russians do after they

792
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,120
occupy an area do they try to disrupt

793
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,960
the networks do they try to censor do

794
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,200
they try to route its uh the traffic in

795
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,039
another way

796
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
so the uh usually when the russians

797
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
occupy a territory the uh the mobile

798
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,399
signals the internet connections are fed

799
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,679
back to russia

800
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
so people in those areas get russian tv

801
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
they get russian self-service they get

802
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,399
russian filtered internet

803
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,360
um

804
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,880
what we saw uh the region uh around uh

805
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
kiev where the the russians actually

806
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,159
went away

807
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,960
um

808
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,840
is that they destroy everything in uh

809
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,559
that they leave behind so they in in

810
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,039
data centers they just pull stuff out of

811
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,520
the racks and smash it on the floor

812
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,159
um in the offices they uh and this was

813
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,120
before bitcoin went down so far but

814
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
um

815
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
yeah they basically opened all the

816
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,840
office pcs and pulled out all the video

817
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,919
cards and ssds before leaving

818
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,640
so

819
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
um yeah there's a uh

820
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
they basically

821
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,480
when they are somewhere and they stay

822
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,679
they make sure it's all russian

823
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,640
controlled the moment they are driven

824
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
away again or they uh pull back

825
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,240
they destroy everything before they

826
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
leave

827
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
so that's that's what we can see from

828
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,559
the strategy

829
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
