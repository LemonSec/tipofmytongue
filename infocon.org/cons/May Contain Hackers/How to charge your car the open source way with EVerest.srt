1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,840
we already sought the next talk which is

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,060
Marco and Cornelius who are talking

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,820
about how to charge your electric car

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,779
with the open source way so uh over to

6
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,480
you thanks a lot

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
um yeah we want to show you about EV

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
charging

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,579
um

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,460
it it sounds easy so charging a car

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,340
shouldn't be too complicated and is it

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,340
really that easy and let's let's dive

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,940
into it that's a really really huge

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,520
ecosystem what kind of evolved over the

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
10 years so even now even before there

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,579
have been a lot of cars and it's from

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,219
the car the charging station a lot of

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,260
different Cloud operations there's a lot

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,059
of protocols I don't want to dive into

20
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,979
all of that we're just diving into that

21
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,920
say car versus Charger versus a bit of

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
war and yeah let's let's digest that

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,159
what's all included in there and you

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,479
basically start with the charging

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,520
station there's a controller let's say

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,020
Raspberry Pi there's some Power

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,259
Electronics and there's a car connected

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,200
data link and powerlink so yeah Power

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,939
there could be different versions of

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,880
that ac voltage is different in every

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,579
region number of phases is different

32
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,560
um the amps are different you can also

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
go DC you can go inductive charging so a

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,479
lot of ways of transforming transferring

35
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,960
the power on top of that you also have a

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
data link there's a physical layer how

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,159
you can transfer that information

38
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,100
between car and charger and there's

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,899
let's say a really dumb version where

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,700
you just have a PV pwm signal which is

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,799
often used but there's also way more

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,500
smart stuff where you exchanging kind of

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,420
XML messages in a really really weird

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,899
format and this is just an extract of

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,580
the different protocols you have and

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,679
this is just one link if you're

47
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,980
extending that up one second and last

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,020
layer of complexity just between car and

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,959
charges is the plug I mean in Europe we

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,760
are kind of standardized to this type 2

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,739
or type 2 combo with DC pins but there's

52
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,260
another link from charging station to

53
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,019
cloud and also there you have a lot of

54
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,640
different protocols

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,120
um open charge Point protocol is one we

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,000
just often used but some Legacy stations

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,099
are using something else or doing their

58
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,640
own stuff and also here a big protocol

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,140
stack

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,660
um the fun fact is most stations have

61
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,000
settled on this ocpp so you're saying

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,099
hey yes the internet is dominant we're

63
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,900
all saved but there are so many

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,640
different dialects like everyone speaks

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,739
the different versions of that protocol

66
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,780
in the end of the day you have to really

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,599
test each cloud with each charger in its

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,120
big nightmare but it doesn't in there so

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,860
one cloud has to talk to another Cloud

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,019
to do roaming so if you have a payment

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,720
Provider from company a and the charging

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,540
station in front of you from Company B

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,480
how do they communicate with each other

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,760
um yeah and then ideally you just want

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,860
to plug in your car and it charges so

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,780
you have to put a lot of public key

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,700
infrastructure on top of that to get

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,860
that running looks like a nightmare and

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,560
yet it's not running yet and it should

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,459
be there since 2014 really soon and it's

81
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,760
not yet out in a broad distribution so

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,920
next level you maybe want to talk to

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,440
humans so you have maybe a display maybe

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,200
a FID reader

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,239
um and there's kind of no standards at

86
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,500
all everyone is doing something

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,299
different than

88
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,459
and yeah then you have maybe other

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,099
charging stations left right you have

90
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,840
electric grid where you want to drain

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,080
power from notes Here Again

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
a lot of different ways how do you want

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,739
to communicate with your local solar

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,659
stations

95
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,720
um a lot of different protocols and it's

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,299
it's really nightmare if you asked any

97
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,580
electrician of can I get a charging

98
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,798
station which speaks to my solo and I

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
just charging what's left over it's it's

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,000
barely you're barely able to buy that

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,639
because nothing works together

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,280
and yeah if we then go to the big

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,800
electricity Grid it's even worse because

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,540
they just starting yet to get some way

105
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,160
of exchanging information about

106
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,840
electricity so what's the current

107
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,300
pricing what's the future pricing can I

108
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,699
get basically only pay the current stock

109
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,440
market price for the energy not

110
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,720
something like an average and can I

111
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,360
maybe disable my charger if there's a

112
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,060
local shortage of transmission so even

113
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,020
if the stock then yeah The Exchange

114
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,580
price for the electricity is really low

115
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,800
it could be there's a bottleneck in

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,199
their local Grid in your street so you

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,820
could get paid for that if there would

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,520
be protocol to to manage that

119
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,699
so in in total with a lot of links in

120
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,580
the charging stations there's too many

121
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,160
standards too many dialects it's ever

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,100
growing nothing really works you have

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
really pure user experience and it's

124
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,080
really really expensive to build shots

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,820
charging stations yeah because of all

126
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,699
that reasons and in the end I think it's

127
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,400
not good for the goal of electrifying

128
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,160
our cars and basically get rid of all

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,919
carbon exhausters in the entire industry

130
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,600
what we have to do for

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,259
saving the spoiling Planet so how can we

132
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,300
fix that we could invent a new standard

133
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,419
right one standard who fits it all but

134
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,919
then we're ending up in that situation

135
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,500
then we just added another standard to

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,180
that nightmare the other ones won't go

137
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,080
away

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
so we think that won't work we think we

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,419
can do that by open source but just

140
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,360
let's say in basically implementing all

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
the standards in one common Library

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,780
maybe you remember the browser was

143
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,720
nothing was compatible 10 20 years ago

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,699
and you have to test every website

145
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,280
against every browser it wasn't fixed by

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,860
improving HTML it was fixed by getting

147
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,340
less engines and doing them open source

148
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,160
and yeah readjust the P tiny puzzle

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
piece and even bigger ecosystem we're

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,460
part of the Linux Foundation energy

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,280
which tries to build a software stack

152
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,979
for the digitalization of a green

153
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,440
electric grid and there's so much more

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
to it we just

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,819
scratched on the car charging part which

156
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,100
will be big in the future but again it's

157
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,020
only a tiny fraction of what we have to

158
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,680
do

159
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,440
and let me hand over to Cornelius so how

160
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,819
we want to fix that

161
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,160
yeah so let's have a look at what

162
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,720
Everest actually is and how we're trying

163
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,660
to solve this mess and improve it

164
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,479
um so we are basically

165
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,220
um riding a complete operating system

166
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,800
for Ev Chargers

167
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,940
that provides all the functionality

168
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,180
needed for both the smart home use case

169
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,039
so basically for AC charges at home

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
where you want to do solar charging and

171
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,900
all that stuff but also for commercial

172
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,699
fast charges that you find on the

173
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,919
highway so basically trying to implement

174
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,620
everything that's between the car and

175
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,660
the cloud

176
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,539
um the average stack runs on basically

177
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,660
any tiny emitted Linux and it the aim is

178
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,740
to support as many Hardware

179
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,039
configurations as possible when it comes

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,660
in a commercial friendly license so it's

181
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,900
all Apache 2 license and the whole idea

182
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,360
is that it's not good for the ecosystem

183
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,340
if everybody reinvents the wheel that's

184
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,360
the current situation everybody

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,419
re-implements the same protocols but

186
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,099
what we want to do is provide an open

187
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,699
source layer that just everybody can use

188
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,060
to improve compatibility and then all

189
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,940
the charging manufacturers can focus

190
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,539
basically all their energy on providing

191
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,520
just a few unique features for their

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,940
product on top of the open source deck

193
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,960
um so how is average built up on the

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,460
inside so it's a very modular

195
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,340
architecture it's kind of a microservice

196
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,099
architecture where each module runs as a

197
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,680
separate Linux process

198
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,840
and these modules can expose interfaces

199
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,139
on an mqtt bus

200
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,440
and modules can also require interfaces

201
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,539
from another module and there's a config

202
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,099
file to connect those we will see that

203
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,620
in a minute and then modules can

204
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,240
communicate so

205
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,899
um

206
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,059
one interesting topic is we'll see that

207
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,820
later how that helps is that these

208
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,320
modules also can run on different

209
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,260
computers since it's mqtt they can also

210
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,940
communicate over the network with each

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,980
other

212
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,300
and there's a whole framework around it

213
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,740
which we call the Emirates framework

214
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
that basically does all the mqtt

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,820
abstraction and takes care of starting

216
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,959
and stopping modules and stuff like that

217
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,100
um

218
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
so one Central thing is the

219
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,959
configuration file in Everest so it's

220
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,700
basically a Json file where you describe

221
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,519
which modules to load and it kind of

222
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,860
represents the hardware so the image is

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,360
not meant to be readable it's just

224
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,700
showing like what modules are typically

225
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,820
there so the idea is

226
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,779
if you build a wall box

227
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,300
for example with two outlets to charge

228
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,820
two cars you basically just load the

229
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,100
charging modules twice and then maybe

230
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
you want Cloud connectivity to your back

231
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
end so you load the ocpp module

232
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
and maybe you have some energy

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,620
management so you load some energy

234
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,240
management modules and then you

235
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,300
basically configured your product

236
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,720
and this is super simple there's even a

237
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,720
graphical tool to do that now so it's a

238
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,459
it's a web tool where you can configure

239
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,040
the whole software stack you can

240
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,839
basically see on the left side

241
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,880
all the available modules that are there

242
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,180
you can just drag and drop them

243
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,500
configure the interior module modules

244
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,240
and also basically create that

245
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,140
configuration file by drawing lines

246
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,500
between the modules for the connection

247
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,220
um

248
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,440
so that's super simple and then once

249
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,140
you're done you can basically hit run

250
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,000
and it will start Everest and you have a

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,060
charging station up and running

252
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,040
configured for your Hardware

253
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,099
um

254
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,200
yeah what are the typical modules that

255
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,820
are inside so most important of course

256
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,040
is kind of the charging core so there's

257
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,019
one module which we call the EVS e

258
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,800
manager that's essentially

259
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,079
um the central module that controls One

260
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,140
charging port to one car it also owns

261
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,060
the charging stations session so it

262
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
basically knows when it starts knows

263
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,600
when it ends it knows everything in

264
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,980
between like how many kilowatt hours

265
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,260
have been charged and all that

266
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,959
um and it also manages all the

267
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,760
interaction between the different Norms

268
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,700
so Marco briefly talked about this so

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,160
there's kind of a basic Signet signaling

270
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,740
which is just a pwm signal on the

271
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,660
control pilot wire

272
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,000
um but then they found that it's not

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,360
enough to just have a pwm signal so they

274
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,300
put an Ethernet link on top of that by

275
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,760
using Powerline ethernet over the same

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,380
wire

277
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,760
um which means there's also the

278
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,160
so-called high-level communication

279
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,300
um with ISO 15118 or Dean spec

280
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
which is essentially a protocol based on

281
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,519
XML where you can talk

282
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,140
um with the car

283
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,019
and it gives you more details such as

284
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,480
how many kilowatt hours are required by

285
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,060
the car to fulfill its charging Target

286
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,420
and how big is the battery and there's a

287
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,740
lot of more information that you can get

288
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,220
out of that car while charging and that

289
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,820
stack is kind of a separate module

290
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,380
which you can load to support that or

291
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,519
you can just leave it out of the

292
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,899
configuration and then you have just a

293
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,279
basic AC charger

294
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,560
uh for DC you always need that because

295
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,839
DC is completely based on isor and

296
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,200
inspect protocols

297
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,880
underneath this charging core modules

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,380
there's a couple of modules which

299
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,519
basically represent the hardware

300
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,399
abstraction layer

301
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,680
we try to make it super easy to Port it

302
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,779
to New Hardware

303
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,700
um there's basically just a few things

304
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
needed there's one module needed to for

305
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,079
the control pilot signal through I think

306
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,779
that feels that's all the pwm generation

307
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,019
you just need to write a small driver

308
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,959
that outputs the pwm at the correct duty

309
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,420
cycle and stuff like that

310
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,680
and then there is Hardware abstraction

311
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,959
for things like power meters if you want

312
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,180
to measure how much you charge for RFID

313
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,639
readers

314
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,920
basically for the power line layer

315
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,500
there's also a slack driver

316
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,880
but if you use like commonly available

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,740
Hardware there are good changes that

318
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,480
chances that there is already a hardware

319
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,180
driver in Everest for that

320
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,639
um

321
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
looking at the other side not so much to

322
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,079
the car but to the cloud for basically

323
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,060
payment stuff

324
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,660
um we provide an ocpp 1.6 Json

325
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,579
implementation

326
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,040
um and we took a lot of work to actually

327
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,260
make it standard compliant and not just

328
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,040
our dialect of it we verified this with

329
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,440
as many commercial backends as possible

330
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,240
and also with the official protocol

331
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,740
testing tool from the open charge

332
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,860
Alliance who supports the standard and I

333
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,399
think we're the only

334
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,720
implementation of ocpp that actually

335
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,300
supports all the optional profiles

336
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,420
uh even with smart charging and all the

337
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,160
security extensions which typically no

338
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
one implements even not in the

339
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,940
commercial uh stuff

340
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,260
um so I think we're the most complete

341
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,720
and also we are the only really working

342
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,019
open source implementation of that

343
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:52,680
um

344
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,779
yeah one of my favorites in Everest is

345
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,180
actually the energy management

346
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,260
um

347
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,320
so you can use the same mechanisms that

348
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,779
we just showed for configuring the

349
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,779
charging station basically drawing these

350
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,459
like track and dropping these modules

351
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,279
and connecting them this time not to

352
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,079
represent the internals of the charging

353
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,180
station but you can also use it to

354
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,639
basically represent the externals of the

355
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,079
charging stations or whole power

356
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,440
distribution tree of the house

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
so on the left side you see this label

358
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,399
fuse 40 amps for example that's kind of

359
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,459
the grid connection point where the

360
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,160
power enters where the house is

361
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
connected to the power grid

362
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,820
um you can basically load a module for

363
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,339
that that's typically just a fuse so

364
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,779
Everest needs to know what the fuse

365
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,600
there is but you can also connect like

366
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,279
site modules to it for example a power

367
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,620
meter so that Everest knows what the

368
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,120
power consumption at the correct

369
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,860
connection point is

370
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,000
um and if you for example have a

371
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
electricity contract that has variable

372
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,959
prices for each hour that's at least in

373
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,279
Germany there are no three providers

374
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
available for that you can also feed

375
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,940
that in so average knows in the end okay

376
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,220
at that point I'm getting power it's

377
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,160
that much and it comes at that price and

378
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,699
from there basically you can model all

379
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,920
your like fuse power distribution tree

380
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,240
of the house

381
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,040
and it can be basically any arbitrary

382
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,899
tree I just made some example here with

383
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,740
the 16 amps fuse on top and two Chargers

384
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,660
that are also 16 amps each so you can

385
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,100
already see that you cannot operate both

386
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,699
of them at full power at the same time

387
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,160
um and on the right side

388
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,779
um you see there are cars connected to

389
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,000
these charging stations and typically

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
every car has a different goal so for

391
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,500
example the first one just needs to

392
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,899
leave as soon as possible

393
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,060
um so we want to charge as much as we

394
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,000
can the second one for example needs to

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
leave 7am next morning and wants to

396
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
charge as cheap as possible until then

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,519
and that's already relatively complex

398
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,040
because you see on the bottom we also

399
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,620
connected like solar panels here in the

400
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,500
energy tree and it comes with a solar

401
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
forecast for the next couple of hours so

402
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
if you want to leave 7am next morning an

403
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,120
optimal solution might be that you're

404
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,800
charging for example this afternoon

405
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,459
between 2 p.m and 4 pm because you will

406
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,019
you know that the sun will be shining

407
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,399
and there will be Excess power available

408
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,220
and maybe the remaining energy that your

409
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,620
car needs

410
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,480
will be charged in the night between 2

411
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,639
am and 4 pm because there your price

412
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,160
indication is so it's going to be cheap

413
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,660
um but since you know from the car how

414
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,100
many kilowatt hours it needs you can

415
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,779
pre-plan that ahead and make sure that

416
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,399
it's actually full at 7am in the morning

417
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
and this for example is the use case

418
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,120
that actually no charging stations

419
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,279
currently really can do

420
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,079
um

421
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,000
and yeah there are other charging goals

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
such as I only want to charge

423
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,100
excess solar power that otherwise would

424
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,139
be wasted and I don't care when it

425
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,540
actually is full and there's already

426
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,459
also cars that are connected to the

427
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,279
charging stations that are already fully

428
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,740
charged but still block One charging

429
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,660
station

430
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,359
um so

431
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
once we have all that information

432
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,839
available we're basically running a

433
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,660
global Optimizer over that whole tree

434
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,240
um that makes sure that all the charging

435
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,819
goals of the individual cars

436
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,140
um are fulfilled as good as possible

437
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,699
while at the same time all the

438
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,700
restrictions from fuses are also met and

439
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,220
we will not blow any of the fuses at any

440
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,260
time and we can control this a lot

441
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,360
faster than the fuses are so we can make

442
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,940
sure that actually that always works the

443
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,559
whole Energy Management gets a lot more

444
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,780
interesting

445
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,600
when chart when the cars are able to

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
charge bi-directionally so so that we

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,820
can draw power from the cars back into

448
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,919
the grid because then you can do a whole

449
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,460
lot more optimizations for example the

450
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,100
one car that uses the excess solar

451
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,720
energy but doesn't have like a fixed

452
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,539
time to leave can be discharged to

453
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,460
charge the car on the top who needs to

454
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,039
leave as soon as possible

455
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,240
to fulfill that Target because we know

456
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,360
know that when that car is already gone

457
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,100
we can recharge the other one with the

458
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,620
solar power again so then the whole

459
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,220
Optimizer gets a lot more complicated

460
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,240
that part is actually under heavy

461
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,980
development and will have a small

462
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
workshop on that tomorrow morning at 11

463
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,980
A.M so feel free to drop by at our camp

464
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,900
yeah what else do we have

465
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,559
um

466
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,340
we have a small display app so for all

467
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,140
Chargers that actually have a local

468
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,340
display there's a flutter based

469
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,580
app that we will also basically port to

470
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,679
Android and iOS in the future but right

471
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,440
now it's only for the local display

472
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,600
um what's interesting as well we have a

473
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,039
complete software in the loop simulation

474
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,320
so the hardware abstraction layer I was

475
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,419
talking earlier about for each of the

476
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,900
hardware drivers there's also a software

477
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
simulation module available

478
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400
so that basically you can run the whole

479
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
Everest like just on your laptop without

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,500
any charging station or a car and you

481
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,660
can also load a simulated car module

482
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,179
that you can attach to those simulated

483
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,700
charging station modules and you can run

484
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,340
full charging station sessions including

485
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,299
ISO 1511 8 support

486
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,260
and basically develop errors and run

487
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,520
simulations and can do fully automatic

488
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,980
testing for example

489
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,700
um

490
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,760
yeah we do use a lot of node red during

491
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,679
development since it's based on mqtt

492
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,660
it's actually fairly easy to

493
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,299
drop in uh not red and build some

494
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,640
development uis to visualize something

495
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
or add some buttons to do something in

496
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,919
the meantime so that's a very nice tool

497
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,460
to use with errors

498
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,340
yeah and basically that's that's it

499
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,280
whatever is what it's about yeah so and

500
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,400
again feel free to join us only GitHub

501
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,360

515
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
oh do we have any questions at the

516
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,400
moment

517
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
I've got one

518
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,299
is this going to lead to more affordable

519
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,520
electric car charges

520
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,820
as an owner myself I think it will lead

521
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,460
to stuff better working and cheaper

522
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,919
charging stations because at the moment

523
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,840
I don't know the company is spending a

524
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,059
lot of money on engineering again and

525
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,400
again again the same stuff so they don't

526
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,539
have to do it yeah okay cool
