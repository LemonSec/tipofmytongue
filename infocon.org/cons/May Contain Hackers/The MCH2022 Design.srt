it was a small scope

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,720
just about who this die mede kaleidoscope and

105
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,310
a small scope

106
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,680
least that you have one base in match and

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,750
all other reflections on that and ever

108
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,730
reflection might be you pray the guy with

109
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,490
die en cisco systems and that's why i

110
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,330
heft it is  there to be a kaleidoscope

111
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,950
we like a petticoat built-in glider

112
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,890
scopes there follows flying it was as if

113
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,510
means that it's full of witches fur and

114
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,190
witches office off the best

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,580
comes

116
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,700
anyway the design of affection tied it

117
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,980
k  nights weekend u we loved that and i

118

and despise offers races

120
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,630
ar randomly generated based on the input

121
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,180
string something like that could systems white string

122
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,780
with ff stream will get s yes home

123
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,630
because the lower part of so year 2017

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,340
ass the seat for the red and generator'

127
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,550
that makes this crisis so is blackwork

128
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,470
and it awesome something meet in paperchase

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,200
and then its putin to view in the party

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,390

part

134
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,430
bercy most beautiful people using something like that

135
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,450
should have great usability

136
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,460
wat wie also use is dan shawl house wie

137
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,230
als we used to generate him a cooler

138
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,880
for the text mastered  it for the main

139
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,300
color of the triangles

140
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,490
and all of this is done in paperchase in

141
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,890
your browser and least that for ff

142
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,430
string grace and free time the cm output

143
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,350
so that cool bios on polishing modder on

144
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,690
its fro  m so if you go to design dat mc

145
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,240
haits twenty twenty dot com dot org

the have items for a user felt there

169
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,529
expires offset is really great

170
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,539
and this random chance

171
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,610
based on the input string that you have this

172
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,159
hacker in your sign

173
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,989
and that's cool

174
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,769
and

175
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,779
but also brings on the issue what is

176
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,929
hacker the thing is finally against  n

177
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,339
doubt for that

178
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,439
and can make forbidden king and that thing

179
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,349
is weird answer by the tour hackers to make

180
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,059
it to the

181
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,159
through the top 200 have no games and a

182
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,659
nice shirt gut be through those

183
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,039
200

184
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,629
definitions or hackers different feels right

185
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,399
now

186
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,499
the thing is  which is less

187
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:07,309
the set of ideals and typical base

188
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:11,119
both reflections of so a choir fx and

189
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,189
that's what one is the thing that you

190
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,479
nights and this they this and to base let's

191
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,539
call the hacker epic is something that

192
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,909
without all the something that define too

193
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,379
long  time ago

194
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,899
summer in the eighty steve and lily rose

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,920
with the air lite hacker it is a shame

205
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,589
that whoever calls it sometimes has a

206
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,540
time switch in it that is already on perfectly

207
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,000
it is the kaleidoscope your effect and 14

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,269
and what we use right now is something

209
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,329
that reflects from this for the design

210
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:12,320
however

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,840
