3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
is anjon brauer i am a software

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359
developer when my father

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,080
bought a commodore 64 i was six and it

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,320
was fun you had those floppy drives and

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
those tapes but the games were so

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
expensive so i went to the library got

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,360
some books started typing the basic code

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
and you learned debugging really quickly

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
because the editors of those books were

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,480
not that good so with

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,440
some

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,399
pencil you start editing and you learn

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,879
how to debug and i never stopped coding

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,760

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
hacker space in western europe

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
i'm a foia request

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
phonetic to annoy the government and i

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,119
like to talk about weird interfaces and

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
connections

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
but not today today we're talking about

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
something that you might have heard of

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
some people call it corona some people

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,280
call it covet 19 and in february 2020 it

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
arrived in the netherlands

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,439
so how this all started and what our

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,560
talks about

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
somewhere in march 2020 there was an

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,079
epitome

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,799
and that was very interesting for us as

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
hackers because it was live streamed the

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
dutch government well mostly rome

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
rosendale who has a talk together with

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
breno the winter at abacus here tomorrow

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,119
at one

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
they they did an epithon to do a corona

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
melder notification app and there were

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
lots of companies with lots of

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
interesting ideas that all could not

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
physically or

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
lawfully work

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,200
so

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,400
a lot of hackers had a lot of big mouth

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
started talking about

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
laughing at it so to say and then ron

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,879
rosendale did a smart thing and i said

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,120
if you all know so well

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,239
prove it

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,280
so

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
he started hiring hackers for example

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
brenno de winter and breno started

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
looking around and thinking

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
who do we need to do this kind of stuff

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
well we need people we can trust

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
people who build camps like this i mean

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
those are people you know you can trust

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
you can rely on

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,879
so at one point somewhere in october

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,440
2020 just after i think the second

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
lockdown or before

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
whatever measurements were there but i

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
know the winter called me and he said

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
hey buck yeah i have a question for you

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
do you have some time left some spare

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
time no

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
yeah but it's in for the state and for

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,519
the world country and can you do a few

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
hours per week and for a few weeks and

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
said yeah i could do that okay that's

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,599
fine yeah i have to work but

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
things have need to happen

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,879
um so it was for a contact it's a

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,440
municipal healthcare organization and

88
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
they need a better contract tracing app

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
and a web app to do their work correctly

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
so i worked on that a bit and meanwhile

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
vaccines started to appear somewhere in

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
the near future

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,239
so

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,440
november 2020

95
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
working working

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
oh no vaccines are here um during a

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
lunch break there was some chats at the

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
ministry of health about registration of

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
them but yeah there are solutions for

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
that right well turns out there weren't

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
solutions for everything there were

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
solutions for the municipal health care

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
for massive vaccination campaigns but

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,840
that's not what the first vaccines are

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,640
going to the first vaccines are going to

106
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
healthcare professionals

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
people in old age homes

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
those kind of people and they don't get

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
vaccinated

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
by the municipal health care system they

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
get vaccinated by our boat doctors so

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
all of a sudden i get a call from

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,800
bugblue he patches in breno in the call

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
and brano says do it for the country we

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
need you yeah just a few weeks it's a

116
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
simple web app but it needs to be secure

117
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
and safe you have a proven track record

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
of doing that kind of stuff we need you

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,680
so yeah i started working

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
so 15th of december 2022 it was the

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
third lockdown or the fourth i really

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,919
forgot but we all remember it

123
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
at nine we had the start of the first

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
workday which was unusual for me because

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
i never get up that early

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
at 10 there was a basic design ready we

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
never changed it at 11

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
they were the first commits to the

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
brahani banani repository because we

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
were plan c we were not meant to be the

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
vaccination registration portal no we

132
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
had to be a bit undercover so we took a

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
github

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,240
organization 91 divock ln which is

135
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,039
nlcovit19 in reverse and we started

136
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
in making some interesting repository

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,560
names there

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
um later that evening first review so

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
what did i do commit first well ci

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
continuous integration pipelines

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
linting testing static code analysis and

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
then because we had a design we knew

143
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
what had to come in we knew what had to

144
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
come out i started doing it all test

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
driven

146
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,240
and

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
the next day yeah anjan needs to go

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,160
shopping because sometimes you need to

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
eat eat so he puts on the face mask

150

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,240

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
you can't do it in person

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
so then we come to the 22nd of december

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
and we're searching a hosting provider

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,400
for when this might be plan a

174
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
that's a little bit of work because

175
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,160
almost everything is closed the

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
government is completely closed in

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
december from the 4th of december till

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
the end of december you cannot request

179
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
anything because of the budget is being

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
closed

181
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
getting hosting everything science is

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
very hard so but we found three

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
providers and we did assessments which

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
provider would be the correct one and

185
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
what could help us the best and we found

186
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,199
one so

187
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
that was good 23rd of december we also

188
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
need to store secrets

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
um all the data that we collect has to

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
be encrypted and where do you store

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
secrets in a hardware security module so

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
they can't be

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
uh can only be used and can't be taken

194
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,680
out yeah so hardware security modules is

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
you get the real stuff they need to burn

196
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
in tests they need some set up time and

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
yeah it was somewhere like christmas new

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,479
year's nothing could be done it takes

199
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,160
two weeks and we had a deadline in the

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
first week of january so

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,479
it's not going to happen but we got the

202
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,039
solution we found very smart people

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
working in our team already thank you

204
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
brenno um he has friends everywhere

205
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
that know things and

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
we found a solution it's called ub keys

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,879
they are basically also a hardware

208
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
security module there you can store in

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
secrets you can generate secrets in them

210
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
they are not to be taken out

211
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
and you can hang them on your keychain

212
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
yeah but also you can put them in the

213
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
server in the data center and

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
physically put a label over it and have

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,879
it all in nice procedures and it's just

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
like a hardware security module

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
your key is pretty nice yeah they're

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
pretty nice they're cheap hard they're

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,799
cheap which is not the biggest thing

220
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
they're available you get them next day

221
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
order even on 30th

222
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
23rd of december

223
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,919
and they're capable and they have

224
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
standard libraries and software to

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,839
integrate with all your software

226
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
so i said christmas oh no

227
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
yep work day 10.

228
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,360
um from this point we have been working

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,920
for 10 days straight i mean the weekends

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
are also work days right and 13 hours a

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
day

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
but yeah this is a day like no other we

233
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
just continue working uh we get our

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
first sysadmin on board because well

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
it's nice to have software you also need

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
to run it somewhere

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
and

238
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
we found the data center but now we need

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
to provision the servers luckily we get

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
a sysadmin and also we get a dba because

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
what is the best way to store

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
more

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
postgresql is just the best nosql

244
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
databases

245
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
what i was looking for thanks

246
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
luckily the dba team came redundantly

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
supplied because they're two brothers

248
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
and they work very nicely together

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,360
uh 26th of december there was

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,680
an interesting peak in the number of

251
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,279
covet

252
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
infections in the netherlands and we

253
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,000
finally have a good schema of how this

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
stuff should be run yeah it still works

255
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,279
this way so then we skip some work days

256
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
because we're working hard

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
31st of december we have been working

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
for two weeks now non-stop so we were

259
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
ordered to stop working at six in the

260
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
evening and not at least not talk to

261
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
your colleagues anymore reintroduce

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
yourself to your friends family and all

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
the people living under your attic in

264
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,440
your house um there were no fireworks

265
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
because it was forbidden so yeah at 12

266
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
o'clock we had fireworks do some

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,880
sleeping oh no fireworks yeah so do some

268
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
sleeping then on the only side of that

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
on the first of january

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
yeah we would not do a stand-up at them

271
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
because all this early stuff let's just

272
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,680
do weekends and holidays we start at one

273
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
that's probably a better idea

274
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
also we got the first machines

275
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,959
provisioned by the

276
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,320
new sysadmin

277
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
and we had to change the application

278
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,519
name because someone decided

279
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,560
that

280
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
brani banani is not something they want

281
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
to present to parliament as a solution

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
for registering covet vaccinations

283
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
so the name was changed to brba it

284
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,720
stands for

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,200
totally not stands for granny banani no

286
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
no it stands for behind strategies from

287
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
bison assets or short as we shorten it

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
for breno and barbara

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we told them afterwards

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
so it's not the secret um then we have

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,839
the lolling weekend so you can just keep

292
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
working you have no distraction from

293
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,000
other people all management is not not

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
all management but all the government is

295
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,519
on holiday and on weekends so it's

296
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
double better plus goods

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,800
and we start continuing um

298
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
but yeah now we also i also get some

299
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
normal developers i mean the ones you

300
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
can or double click order from

301
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
agencies

302
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
and i've never managed the team before

303
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
so i call my good friend ronsbach you

304
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
might have seen him

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
last time we were here doing a talk

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
together with me about privacy and

307
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,519
penises

308
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,640
um

309
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
i gave him a call and luckily we were

310
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
just bouncing off some ideas got the

311
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720
whole idea to do simplified scrum just

312
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,959
every day early meeting

313
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,200
well 10 is early for me

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
and asked three questions what have you

315
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
done yesterday what are you doing today

316
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
what do you need from anybody else in

317
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,079
the team or outside of the team

318
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
that worked and we also got our data

319
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
models from the national institute for

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
public health and the environment

321
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
to do some data exchange because well

322
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
registering covet vaccinations is

323
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
interesting but

324
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
we need some science to be done and

325
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
they are the ones doing the science yeah

326
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,639
so we tried to exchange the data and we

327
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
found out that exchange should be

328
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,560
exchanged to a secure exchange so we can

329
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
exchange the data in a secure way to

330
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
exchange it yeah ftping csv files is not

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
something we would

332
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
do it's the industry standard we set

333
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,200
another standard but we also got the

334
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,079
data models and data models are nice

335
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
especially within government they make

336
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
large big data models you feel so dirty

337
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
after reading them that you need to go

338
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
to shower so we got a lot of showering

339
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,240
a lot of showers uh january 5th

340
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
application is ready which is a good

341
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
thing because it's gonna have to be live

342
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,279
the next day

343
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
we do some loss testing in our future

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
production environment because everybody

345
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
knows you do development testing

346
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,519
acceptance production but in practice

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
nobody does that everybody does it in

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,680
dutch the optaway or in english dpta

349
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
acceptance always comes last just look

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
at the stages of grief

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
and if you want to know more about doing

352
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
stuff in production there's an

353
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,279
interesting batch talk this tuesday at

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,519
13 40 on this stage

355
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
so but 5th of january we needed to have

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
credentials handed out to a lot of

357
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,959
people working in hospitals and people's

358
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
homes and all those things

359
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
more in buenos talk but we needed

360
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
some help to distribute it not normal

361
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,519
companies it was in obtainium

362
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
they had no people they had no time so

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
we called the military um seems to have

364
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,240
some friends there which was not the

365
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
correct way to do it but it worked out

366
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
very well in the end nobody got fired

367
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,079
over this

368
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,760
ah january 6th this was early for me

369
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
seven in the morning you log into the

370
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
server four eyes because everything has

371
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
to be done with at least four eyes on

372
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
there

373
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
you delete all the registration data

374
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
from the production database

375
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
you drink a couple of beers and you go

376
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,519
to sleep

377
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,880
so next day

378
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,079
yes

379
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,480
finally first vaccination

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
it was a nursing home worker and she got

381
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
registered through

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
brba

383
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
good meanwhile there were some other

384
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,079
projects because we're working hard on

385
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,360
this but also there were some other

386
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,199
projects as an industry they were

387
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
working on qr codes this one you can

388
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
actually scan and it will show you

389
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
that's a demo code um

390
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
we decided together that you can have

391
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
more privacy with less data which is not

392
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
a revelation for us but for some

393
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
people in the government it's very new

394
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
um

395
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
in europe like this qr code this

396
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
contains a lot of data that contains

397
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
first name last name date of birth uh

398
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
where your vaccination was all those

399
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,240
details

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
in the netherlands we decided we don't

401
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
need that much information

402
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,959
but we'll come back to that for you and

403
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
we start a small uh in the application

404
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
but it got extended with the european

405
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,399
connection and now you can travel the

406
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,639
world around with it um

407
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
we also started to have it printable by

408
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,399
medical personnel

409
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,160
because that will work for everybody you

410
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
don't yeah you need somebody medical

411
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,480
staff when they vaccinate you and that's

412
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,680
all or test um but we also got you can

413
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
request it by snail mill if you don't

414
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
have anything digitally

415
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
you can go to the website and print it

416
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
or you can use the app

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
and yeah those european codes they

418
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,680
contain all that data but do you need

419
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,480
that

420
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,800
do you need for your

421
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,959
cinema for your pub for your restaurant

422
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
do you need to know someone's full name

423
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
date of birth where they were vaccinated

424
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
what they were given no of course not

425
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
all you need is to be able to check

426
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
their identity so we got initials first

427
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
letter of first name first letter of

428
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
last name if applicable um and

429
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
the date of birth without a year yes

430
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,079
that was all that is in the dutch

431
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
domestic qr codes the app was made way

432
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
more fancy because it made you interact

433
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
with the ball between two qr codes which

434
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,040
switched every minute um it's very fancy

435
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
crypto based on hobby by the irma team

436
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
if you want to know more about it then

437
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
tomorrow at nine here

438
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
but meanwhile

439
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
we just had about truncating data yes

440
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
our first data delivery a lot of people

441
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,759
have been vaccinated a lot of people

442
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,839
have been registered we need to get that

443
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,160
data to the national institute for

444
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
public health and the environment

445
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
and we did get it to be sent encrypted

446
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
this time uh public key encryption

447
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
and we do an export and because of the

448
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,800
very slow hsms we can we use the ubi

449
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,920
keys it took us two hours well you do

450
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
that in a screen because four eyes two

451
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,799
people looking at the screen

452
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
over jitsi and we do the export it runs

453
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,359
for two hours and the sysadmin says well

454
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
my screen is stuck i said well mine

455
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
isn't so i type hoi space exclamation

456
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,039
mark exclamation mark so the next line

457
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,199
was command.found and the output in

458
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
file.nc was empty

459
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
because the other guy was pressing enter

460
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,559
a lot

461
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,799
yes

462
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,400
so we run again another two hours we

463
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
copy that stuff over to the national

464
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,679
institute for health and environment

465
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,919
and the other people in the jet seas

466
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,960
shout date day date i type date and

467
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,400
ta-da we had 10 minutes to spare then i

468
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
walked out in the snow to take a very

469
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,760
relaxing walk and i got a nice t-shirt

470
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,559
in the mail a week later

471
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,160
so

472
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
but back to the serious business the qr

473
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,039
codes um it should be work for everybody

474
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
because um if you are making something

475
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,760
mandated by by law then it should work

476
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,679
for everybody um what we did was um make

477
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,960
a basic solution that worked for

478
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,720
everybody healthcare workers just type

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
in everything and press print and but we

480
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,480
don't hate healthcare workers so we did

481
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
optimizations it's the 80 20 rule if you

482
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,720
can optimize it for 80

483
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
and you have only 20 of work left and

484
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
then you do it again and then you have

485
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
20 of 20 left and you do that a few

486
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
steps like four or five and then

487
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,240
healthcare workers don't start to hate

488
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
you it's very nice

489
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
um

490
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
yeah and also we try to do credentials

491
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
for all the images but sometimes it's

492
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
very hard to find meme sources so if you

493
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
know who made this please tell us we'll

494
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,919
fix it

495
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,120
but yeah there are exceptions to

496
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,360
everybody every rule

497
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
you can make as nice system as you want

498
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
but not everybody gets fascinated by the

499
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
municipal health care organs qr code via

500
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
dda because it's registered somewhere

501
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,160
some people don't

502
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
even

503
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
have have a way to authenticate to the

504
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
government via dgid or

505
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,039
didn't get vaccinated in europe yeah um

506
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,360
because they travel abroad by a plane or

507
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,679
by ship and they get vaccinated in a

508
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,320
walmart in america and then yes how do

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
you get in touch qr code um there are

510
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
solutions made for that it's a lot of

511
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,039
hard work

512
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,000
but the idea was leave no one behind but

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
also

514
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
we try to have a bit of data hygiene

515
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
because else you get a data dollhoff

516
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
incomplete data really hurts people if

517
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
you need two vaccinations and only one

518
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
is popping up

519
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
the other one is gone and now somebody

520
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
says yeah but you can print it but it's

521
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
not complete and but i need to take an

522
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
airplane to my family in somewhere for

523
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,320
my parents who are on their deathbed

524
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,039
yeah no you can't fly because now your

525
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
data is not registered correctly well

526
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,600
yeah business rules are important you

527
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,520
should define them well so what does

528
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
this data mean what does the data

529
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,320
represent delete all the data you don't

530
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
use

531
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
always because um

532
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,320
if it leaks if it if it's not there it

533
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
cannot leak you cannot abuse it you

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
cannot use it for things that it's not

535
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
supposed to be used for

536
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
we're hackers we misuse everything

537
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,159
what's not supposed to be used for don't

538
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,840
do that with people's personal data and

539
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
especially not with sensitive data like

540
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
medical data and

541
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
when you do something with data always

542
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
refresh at source

543
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,559
there's something with caching who'll

544
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
come to that

545
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
and you should have exception routes

546
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
because and have them ready day one

547
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
because you can't have true equity if

548
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
all marginalized people who already have

549
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,080
to do

550
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
run through hoops have to do it again

551
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
and again and and again but also you

552
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
have to prevent those exemption routes

553
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
that we've built

554
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
to become the rule

555
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,280
uh it would be very stupid if you have

556
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,720
someone go through loops go to their

557
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
care professional get a printed qr code

558
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
and have to redo that every three months

559
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,799
so

560
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,880
we worked hard on getting that stuff

561
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,760
done

562
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,200
also for attributions you know

563
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
newspapers say

564
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,679
source

565
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,600
youtube so we say source newspaper

566
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
oh

567
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
all that hard work

568
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
comes to in

569
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
to a point of going live again

570
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
the european qr code system gets live

571
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
and our minister of health wants to meet

572
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
the people that build it

573
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
normally

574
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
in the dutch government all those kind

575
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
of conversations go through cisco webex

576
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
which is a terrible chat application

577
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
and

578
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
the

579
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
we said yeah that's fun but no just come

580
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,919
to our place come to meet hack42 yitzi

581
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,880
and he did and the first thing he does

582
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
is send this twitter image

583
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,919
so yeah that's easy to get it cleared

584
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,960
because it's already public and

585
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
the second thing we do is ask him are

586
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,880
you wearing a seatbelt

587
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
and yes he showed he was wearing a seat

588
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,440
belt uh so yeah of course and the

589
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,159
informal tone was set yes

590
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,559
so then you have had half will have a

591
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,799
lot of discussions about political about

592
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,039
2d 3g 4g 2g plus 2d minus 3d plus 3d

593
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,960
mining 1.5 g 2.5 g really they invented

594
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
a whole lot number of g's for this um

595
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
it's a lot of political discussion and

596
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
you never know what the outcome is for

597
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
people who don't know anything about the

598
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,280
g's it stands for

599
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,320
it was all german but in dutch vaccine

600
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,679
and it's uh that they made different uh

601
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
um combinations of that and gave it

602
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,520
different numbers and nobody knows what

603
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,559
it means

604
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,720
so but we had to prepare for all the

605
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
options because then the politics might

606
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,640
say that next week we should have these

607
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
rules and that should be enforceable and

608
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
how well

609
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,880
we were doing news driven development

610
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
and some places because the information

611
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
was faster through news outlets like

612
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
new.nl

613
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,880
than through the official lanes of

614
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
communication so make it configurable

615
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,600
sign your configurations and have it

616
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
work that way

617
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
yeah so then we come to the two hardest

618
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,559
problems with computer

619
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,400
naming things cache validation

620
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
especially for amy off by one errors

621
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,360
so off by one hour's birthdays

622
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,840
um a birthday is not a date

623
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
it can be

624
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
a birth year it can be birth year in a

625
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
birth month so you don't have birthday

626
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
don't store it in a date column you see

627
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,080
everybody does it everywhere and it's

628
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
giving us

629
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
real lot of

630
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,720
hassles to do this some points in the

631
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
government they do this correctly and

632
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,400
that's where it gets starts to get

633
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
incompatible and also not everybody has

634
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
a legal birth date

635
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,919
we didn't know that so the second thing

636
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,919
is naming things or we name a lot of

637
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,520
things this is called the stage all the

638
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
things are humans we name them

639
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
not everybody has a first name not

640
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
everybody has last name not everybody

641
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,559
even has a name or a legal name and for

642
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
character sets

643
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,960
my dear friends at every government

644
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
place that use it latino one is not an

645
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
option use utf-8

646
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,159
and for one special department taylor

647
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,400
text encoding should not be used anymore

648
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,190
since the 90s

649
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,679
[Applause]

650
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,120
cashier validation yes so how do you

651
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
delete data you don't know about because

652
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
we as already said don't cache start at

653
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
source if possible but if somebody

654
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
prints out a qr code or has a yellow

655
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,559
booklet and you want in to invalidate

656
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
the information in there is that even

657
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,440
possible

658
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
we know that it's not impossible until

659
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
you start attaching claymores to yellow

660
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,840
booklets which was declined by request

661
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,279
so

662
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,159
it's impossible at some point so always

663
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
assume that once data is out there it's

664
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,600
like

665
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,679
oil it will stay there but we'll get

666
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,039
back to this

667
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,960
yes

668
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
good thing we have all those exception

669
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,600
routes because estimates are always low

670
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
how many people do you think will need

671
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
to be registered via those systems well

672
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,760
ten thousand fifty thousand well

673
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
it was more like a million

674
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
queues started showing up at schiphol

675
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,640
airport because people couldn't fetch

676
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,600
their test data in the app

677
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
people didn't even know they needed to

678
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,960
be tested and all the test facilities

679
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,279
couldn't get their data out soon enough

680
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,279
we had people whose name in the passport

681
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,559
was different than in the government

682
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,600
database

683
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,279
which is weird because they should be

684
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
have been made from that database but um

685
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,919
yeah things happen um but this is a

686
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
manual labor intensive process so if you

687
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,159
want to scale it up you need more people

688
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,000
and that's what we know all that

689
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
shortage of workers it starts to get

690
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
more expensive so try to avoid it try to

691
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
avoid big data when i was waking up that

692
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
morning um i read that there were queues

693
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,799
at scripple i do a stand-up where is our

694
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
sis admin well he's at skripal what is

695
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
he doing he's buying new inkjets for the

696
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,840
inkjet printers why were they inkjet

697
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,360
printers or was it breno that got your

698
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,559
body inkjet printers it was breno

699
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,480
he was setting up the network because

700
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,960
public wi-fi was a bit flaky

701
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,080
anyway big data yeah big data we try to

702
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
avoid it

703
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,559
we try to have decentralized storage

704
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,799
because sources are decentralized and we

705
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
want to have a source much as possible

706
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,600
we use strong authentication

707
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,520
the client controls the data so you get

708
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
to first see what data is fetched from

709
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
you you can review it before you even

710
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,480
start to use your data and we use as

711
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,120
little as data as possible

712
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,600
we tried to talk to the european union

713
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,799
about it

714
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,360
that sadly failed in some parts

715
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,080
so ethics and social impact uh in the

716
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,039
netherlands we have a democrat democracy

717
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,679
well a constitutional democracy

718
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
we have a parliament they make rules and

719
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,200
then we try to implement those law with

720
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,159
as

721
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,720
most freedoms as possible

722
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,840
and

723
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
that is really hard apparently for

724
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
government workers because normally they

725
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,720
just look at laws and go by oh yeah we

726
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
could interpret this very strict

727
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,960
try not to

728
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
also the covet virus is hard to battle i

729
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,600
mean we are missing a lot of people at

730
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
this event

731
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,279
because they got tested positively and

732
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
now had to go home

733
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,880
also outcome isn't sure we don't know

734
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,039
how this thing goes how long it will

735
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,520
continue so we have to implement

736
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,120
failsafes for a lot of that stuff and

737
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,200
all the temporary restrictions we have

738
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,919
to

739
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,640
make sure encode that everything that is

740
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
temporary

741
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
stays temporary yeah because normally as

742
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
we hackers know nothing is as temporary

743
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,679
or as as permanent as a temporary fix

744
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,679
yeah the the cable you duct taped to the

745
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
wall 10 years ago still hangs there it

746
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,120
works perfectly you're never going to

747
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,240
fix that

748
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,480
that's not an option if you do

749
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,679
things like this

750
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,120
also

751
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,919
when battling the coronavirus um yes you

752
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,679
have your expectations that vaccines

753
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,480
work

754
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
um we found out that they don't work

755
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,760
just a second after you got them uh

756
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
dance with johnson was not a very good

757
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,480
experiment

758
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,679
but you don't know if and if it worked

759
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,919
and vaccinations people couldn't get

760
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,679
infected it would be

761
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,520
very fine and then some of the solutions

762
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
would have worked better so you don't

763
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,120
know but if you wouldn't have built it

764
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,840
you couldn't even use it then

765
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
so then we come to the privacy and the

766
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,679
security part of it um we have uh

767
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,919
privacy we have security both are very

768
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
difficult to do correctly and a lot of

769
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,799
people have this false

770
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,840
idea that there is a balance of privacy

771
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
and security no there is not that is

772
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
utter you can't have privacy

773
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,559
without security you can't have security

774
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,320
without privacy so you make sure it's

775
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,000
encrypted everywhere if your data your

776
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,679
database is encrypted and you had

777
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,520
database administrators cannot see the

778
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,399
data

779
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
when they falsely

780
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,080
might see some data they see encrypted

781
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,799
blobs and that's it

782
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,880
and that's protecting them but it's also

783
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,640
protecting the data so privacy and

784
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,799
security come from both ends

785
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,640
so we try to implement technical

786
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,880
security first that means that like

787
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,360
encryption of data and then procedural

788
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
security like database administrators

789
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
are not allowed to view the data that's

790
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,600
the second one and we implemented them

791
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
both of course in every occasion because

792
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,679
that's the best thing you can do

793
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
security is like an onion layers oh yes

794
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,679
finally i got my vaccination

795
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,919
and i can load it into the app that's

796
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,320
awesome next

797
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
yes

798
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
in the future because what are you still

799
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,399
doing there

800
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,440
now we're

801
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,799
we're helping out

802
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,640
we found out that uh

803
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,000
there are some big um

804
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
challenges

805
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
challenges this was a challenge thank

806
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
you there are some big challenges within

807
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,200
the government to replace smart cards

808
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,159
with authentication methods

809
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
we need to open source all the things

810
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
and every thanks to the question

811
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
everything we open source is a european

812
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,480
union public license

813
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,279
but we have more to do because at one

814
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,559
point

815
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,640
our government decided

816
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
that we don't use qr codes in the

817
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
netherlands anymore so the world privacy

818
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
preserving knight thing

819
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,440
yeah it's gone

820
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
um it's still open source it's still in

821
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
source you can still build it but it's

822
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
gone it's not used anymore you're not

823
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
allowed to use it anymore but what about

824
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,399
those printed qr codes then yeah they

825
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,240
still exist and you can rebuild source

826
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
and then check them because the public

827
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
key is available so i can see oh yeah

828
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,279
this was signed by the dutch government

829
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,559
yes yes yes

830
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,600
so we found a solution it's a wall talk

831
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
to explain why this perfectly makes

832
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,480
sense but

833
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,399
the idea is that it might be a very good

834
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,720
idea to publish the private key

835
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
because once you have published a

836
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
private key you can do everything with

837
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
it you can check the integrity was it a

838
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
real good private key as you promised

839
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,559
always

840
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,960
but also you can make any qr code in

841
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
anything in the past or the future with

842
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
this key as this key is no longer in the

843
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
trusted list

844
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,519
it's not it's nothing anymore so

845
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,559
um

846
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
tomorrow night i have a talk sorry

847
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
tonight in clairvoyance i have a talk at

848
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
10.

849
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
i'm not going to deep in this but if you

850
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,679
have questions about it please ask me

851
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,440
afterwards i have a question why is that

852
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
keynote in an hsm

853
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
oh yeah we did fancy crypto and the hsms

854
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
don't support those

855
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
yes

856
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
so that's why you need to go to the gabi

857
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,559
tool

858
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,120
um so we have some time left i think for

859
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
the questions heroin yes

860
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
and if you don't know a question you

861
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,360
cannot come up with a question we

862
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,200
provided you with an array of example

863
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
questions

864
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,969
[Applause]

865
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,440
and um

866
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,519
i think that's very very kind for the

867
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,120
audience but i'm also curious if there

868
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
are other questions than these or people

869
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,480
have questions which relate to this list

870
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
perhaps first also check if they're from

871
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,519
the signal any questions not yet

872
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,120
who wants to start with the first

873
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,200
question

874
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
running

875
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
running for the microphone of course

876
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
what was the most complicated thing that

877
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,399
you had to do what's the most

878
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,080
complicated challenge that you gave

879
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,559
because you now had a story of all the

880
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,159
challenges or at least the bigger ones

881
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,320
but what was the hardest one to solve

882
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,679
government

883
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,200
try to talk with normal civil

884
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
government workers

885
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
who have been there for years and do

886
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,320
everything in procedures that have been

887
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
existed since the stone ages

888
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
yeah i kind of agree yeah

889
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,440
so

890
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,240
the whole 2g discussion then went going

891
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,279
on

892
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,440
um

893
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,159
a lot of people would say well 2g

894
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,640
excludes people from society because

895
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,039
they would have to be vaccinated to get

896
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,039
in somewhere did you have any

897
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,840
discussions within the team yes yes

898
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,679
actually yes not only with the team

899
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
because this was a real discussion point

900
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
with us and we did have a discussion

901
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,559
with the minister who called him about

902
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,200
this because he knew we as a team uh

903
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,159
were very vocal about it and were very

904
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
uh ahead our opinions and we had also

905
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
discussion with the minister it was an

906
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,080
open discussion um which was not

907
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,159
recorded and there are no notes from but

908
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,240
so we could really say what was on our

909
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,879
minds yeah we could tell our points of

910
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,760
view why we thought 2g was a very stupid

911
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,079
idea and we got answers why

912
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,040
the government wants or at least the the

913
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,679
thought about it yeah why they did want

914
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
it and it came down to

915
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,000
lowering the number of cases in hospital

916
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,719
because vaccinated people get less

917
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,159
seriously ill

918
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,320
so it wouldn't stop the number of

919
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,199
infections it would just lower the

920
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,719
pressure on caretakers

921
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,359
you're welcome some more questions

922
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,639
so you had a slide about government

923
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
models and i gather you don't like them

924
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,079
but could you maybe uh elaborate on that

925
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,520
or is that yeah

926
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,240
um no no no i can't i can't explain this

927
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,880
it's uh because they make data models

928
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
and they make data models all the life

929
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,160
and some people have the job of making

930
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
data models so their only job is make

931
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
more data model in the data model so you

932
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
get

933
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
pages and pages of very old made to be

934
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
printed on matrix printers data models

935
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,160
that are extended with different images

936
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
to be printed on

937
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,920
needle printers and really that's what's

938
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,640
existing right now if we print some of

939
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
the data models of

940
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,119
the rfvm what is it the

941
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
public health and environment

942
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
database they use for uh for covet

943
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,839
tracking

944
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
if we would print it in readable print

945
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,079
it would take this entire screen for

946
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,119
that data model of interconnected lines

947
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,040
with all kinds of

948
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,040
weird combinations of older data types

949
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,760
so

950
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,560
they they put every exception in the new

951
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
version of the data model and then and

952
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
every time it was have you seen this bit

953
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,079
in quadrant a 53 35 and i'm looking at

954
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,000
ah i have to take another shower

955
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,079
because so this is

956
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
so good

957
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,240
does this answer your question

958
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,479
okay

959
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,920
so

960
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,839
how many systems did you guys have to

961
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,760
develop to get all this working

962
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
and are you still developing new ones

963
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,880
nah we're not really developing new ones

964
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
we started with binding uh older ones

965
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
together because the some of it because

966
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
of the speed of development had a lot of

967
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,839
shared code and why not just combine

968
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,960
them into a shared code base uh for

969
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,320
maintainability so we made one

970
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,240
we started with number three and we got

971
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,640
to 12 and then we started with engine

972
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
number three and we went to ten

973
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,040
and then we have some other systems so

974
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,160
you can calculate i think it's

975
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,839
35-ish uh different

976
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,839
github repos yeah something

977
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
unfortunately not 42 no but there are

978
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,760
other teams working

979
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,560
how are you even allowed to give this

980
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,520
talk um because

981
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
because because because very easy

982
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,160
you need to know how the government

983
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,240
works we were told upfront that you need

984
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,720
permission so we know that yeah without

985
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
permission giving this talk is

986
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
frowned upon and we could get uh some

987
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,880
warning that was the worst that could

988
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,920
happen but okay um so what we did we

989
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,680
asked somebody who was allowed to give

990
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,359
some clearance and uh he asked advice at

991
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,880
some other person the other person said

992
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,359
yeah my advice is to do it and he said

993
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
yes and as this government they didn't

994
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,880
read the documents because they didn't

995
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
have the documents

996
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,240
that's how it works

997
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,280
[Applause]

998
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,640
i believe in the beginning there was

999
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,839
also talk about the tax services

1000
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,119
being the hosting party uh that was uh

1001
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,200
for corona melder that was before we

1002
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
started

1003
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,040
and yes the dutch tech services do a lot

1004
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,400
of i.t

1005
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,480
and so they have housing and they might

1006
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,320
have something available

1007
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,720
that didn't go very well due to some

1008
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,320
things in parliament in the press it was

1009
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
not the people there it was uh more it

1010
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,440
was politically not doable and then yeah

1011
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,640
the team then uh uh found a solution so

1012
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
that's all fixable the tax office does

1013
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,359
work for us as we said there's a way to

1014
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,720
get printed

1015
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,200
documents sent via snail mail

1016
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,400
we wanted to get the seibe to print them

1017
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
because they're the most famous for

1018
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,599
getting envelopes on dutch people's

1019
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,040
doorsteps

1020
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
like all the traffic tickets and stuff

1021
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,240
they didn't want to couldn't whatever uh

1022
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,000
who's the second best at printing and

1023
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,079
getting it on your doorstep the blasting

1024
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,040
deans so the text office is our postal

1025
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,880
service

1026
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
okay thank you you're welcome

1027
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
and i really really want to know the

1028
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,800
answer to the last question oh that's

1029
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,400
very easy i can explain this in detail

1030
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,320
yes at once we had the ministry of

1031
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,440
minister of justice

1032
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,880
mr harper house and he said those people

1033
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
at ndo they're they're magicians and

1034
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,599
then our reply was it's only magic if

1035
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,400
you don't know what you're doing

1036
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:20,960
[Applause]

1037
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,839
very good question

1038
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,599
[Applause]

1039
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,920
corona check is currently shutting down

1040
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,440
or at the end of

1041
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,839
of development and i was wondering that

1042
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,320
published a private key

1043
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,200
um

1044
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
what if corona check ends up being

1045
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,320
necessary in some form then then you

1046
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
just what happens then you just generate

1047
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
new private key put a public key of that

1048
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,240
private key in the trusted list in the

1049
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,359
app and you can continue working only

1050
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,760
everybody needs new new documents to

1051
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
prove uh against what the rules are new

1052
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
code yeah the printed codes are expiring

1053
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
anyway in the near future because of the

1054
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,040
data restrictions that were on there so

1055
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,520
um they everybody would already have to

1056
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,280
print a new paper then do it with a new

1057
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,240
key if it needed to be used again

1058
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
thanks

1059
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
you're welcome some more questions we

1060
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
have example questions

1061
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,000
left

1062
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
please please

1063
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,118
does not exist

1064
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,920
yes yes it exists and it is running uh

1065
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,160
in uh trial now

1066
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,599
uh

1067
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,760
pop is uh well we were talking about

1068
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,599
exception routes some people in the

1069
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,680
netherlands don't have a social security

1070
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,960
number for example ukrainian refugees if

1071
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,240
they come here and they are not

1072
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
vaccinated they are asked would you like

1073
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
to be vaccinated and then they get

1074
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
vaccinated by the municipal healthcare

1075
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,200
organization

1076
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,319
of the municipality of wherever their uh

1077
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,880
asylum seeker home is

1078
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
and

1079
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,119
how do they get their data well they can

1080
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,079
now with their uh patient id and their

1081
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,560
date of birth and the second factor is

1082
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,880
either sms or email

1083
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
and pop is not a vlan but is a product

1084
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,000
of the vlad team and fly is not a pop

1085
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,240
very clear yes next question

1086
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,400
so i wonder why the

1087
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,359
european qr codes are bigger

1088
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,200
than the netherlands qr code even though

1089
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,560
the storm

1090
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,040
because because they now that's not true

1091
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,160
the dutch qr codes are uh sometimes

1092
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,200
bigger

1093
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,319
um but the europeans contain a lot more

1094
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,200
data

1095
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,960
so that was my question actually why the

1096
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,440
netherlands is bigger in size but has

1097
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,119
less data because of the encryption

1098
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
that's being used to provide you more

1099
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,960
privacy

1100
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
so um yeah go to the gabi talk if you

1101
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,880
want to know all about how they use it

1102
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,560
yeah that's two more nerves sunday

1103
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,560
nine i think uh some more questions

1104
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,880
can you repeat the question

1105
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,440
yeah what what's with all the cats yes

1106
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,079
once with all the cats nice very simple

1107
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
we had breno on our team and branno uh

1108
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah as we said at the start uh the

1109
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
first application i started working on

1110
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
was called brani banani and that wasn't

1111
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
for a big loaf of bananas or anything

1112
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
but

1113
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
one of breno's cats is called brani and

1114
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,240
the nickname is banani so brani and

1115
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,960
banani became the first two parts of the

1116
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,839
stack and then later his other cat which

1117
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,440
is a really whiny whiny cat called zyko

1118
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,880
oh no

1119
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,200
so we got kaiko and zyko in there as

1120
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
modules and we just started naming

1121
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,599
everything cat names so if we had a new

1122
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,599
module we're just asking the team does

1123
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,920
anybody have a cat name for us oh yeah

1124
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
we have casper oh yeah we have millions

1125
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
the good thing is i have a cat that's

1126
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,359
called monster

1127
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,560
so that's with all the cat names

1128
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,480
question here from the back

1129
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,560
is it a good idea to block the recall

1130
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,520
certificates using uvci specifically

1131
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,599
um

1132
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,920
this is a good idea to to list

1133
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,640
yes and no it's very hard to identify

1134
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
which certificates you need to recall

1135
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,480
and it's only possible with the european

1136
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,319
certificates because they have an

1137
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,000
identifier in it the dutch ones are

1138
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,280
privacy preserving as said

1139
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,160
and

1140
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,720
there are ways to

1141
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,800
block the ufc ice and there's now a

1142
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,680
scheme in europe to do that and

1143
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,920
currently the only ones i know that are

1144
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,960
blocked are the very obvious uh fake

1145
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,359
ones we had the ad of hitler qr code in

1146
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,880
the media

1147
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,400
mickey mouse

1148
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,800
but also ones that are found in

1149
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
in some stings with massive collections

1150
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,119
of uh fake documents

1151
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,480
yeah and also the qr code from emmanuel

1152
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
was blocked in the netherlands is it the

1153
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,040
smart way of of blocking i don't i i

1154
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
don't know there are not so many ways

1155
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,079
you can do this because privacy also

1156
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,720
makes risk but can you take somebody's

1157
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,960
passport when it's stolen if you don't

1158
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,680
know who stole it

1159
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,599
does that answer the question

1160
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,599
more or less

1161
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,599
well you can find us afterwards for more

1162
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,400
details if you want

1163
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,160
more questions

1164
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
otherwise i do have one because

1165
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,680
you have this really nice list and you

1166
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,880
know all the answers because you

1167
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,480
prepared them yeah are there any

1168
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,880
questions where you would not know the

1169
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,960
answer to or would not be allowed to

1170
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,640
there are two questions i'm not allowed

1171
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,680
to answer

1172
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,399
but they're very private

1173
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,599
all the rest is now

1174
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,040
let's make this very clear we work at

1175
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,400
the government the government is uh open

1176
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
there are laws about it there are laws

1177
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,400
about reusable documents codes other

1178
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
things the laws about being open

1179
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,040
we know that we work there we know and

1180
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
and you get used to it that your email

1181
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,319
that you're sending there can be

1182
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,920
published in some point in time if

1183
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,440
somebody requested

1184
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,040
um it's yeah we're very open so if you

1185
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
say if there's some secrets you have the

1186
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,240
passwords but i don't have access to the

1187
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,800
computers so it would be my

1188
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,680
password the only nda i have signed is

1189
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,200
for medical data that i see so

1190
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,839
nope

1191
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,599
all right anyone for the final question

1192
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,720
the question is oh monkey box

1193
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,480
um the question is uh

1194
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,520
does this also can be used for other uh

1195
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
diseases

1196
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,079
uh well yes uh we already have uh monkey

1197
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,720
box check monkey box uh melder and

1198
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
everything linking to the current corona

1199
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
infrastructure and we've made it very

1200
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,960
configurable so

1201
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
yeah it's it's

1202
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,960
virus agnostic so to say

1203
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,440
so and since it's open source yeah it's

1204
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,680
very easy to fork and make a monkey box

1205
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
variant

1206
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,440
yes we anticipated on reusability

1207
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,760
yes i'm not going to repeat what set he

1208
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
was here in france because

1209
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,720
so if people really want to know perhaps

1210
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
they should check on you um because uh

1211
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,440
