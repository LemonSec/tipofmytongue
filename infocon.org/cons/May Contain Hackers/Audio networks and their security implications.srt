[Music]

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,520
we had a look at the schedule there was

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,560
there is this talk called audio networks

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
and the security implications and you're

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,300
probably going to well why do we have

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,619
security implications with audio

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,619
networks it's all XLR and analog and

8
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,779
they're under security issues right well

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,320
the apparently the world moved on and

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
now it's all audio over IP and

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
especially with commodity Hardware so

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,239
here to talk about audio networks and

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,980
security implications please welcome

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,680
with a very warm Round of Applause PC

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,100
whiz

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,760
hey

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,140
hey

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,640
yes I'm on PC whiz uh I uh work for the

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,079
company that put the sound system in

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
Abacus if you've heard that you've

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,100
probably definitely heard that on Friday

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,379
night if you were here

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,100
um but this is uh my own work outside of

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,560
work so I've been sort of doing my own

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,500
research

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,939
but I work in that field and that's why

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sort of looking at it

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
so I'm hopefully I'm going to introduce

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,220
you to audio networks what they are and

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,619
um wherever deployed and get you a bit

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,060
interested and also show you just how

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,299
soft they are as a Target

33
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,759
and then after showing you how software

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,860
was a Target hopefully uh people

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,840
interested enough to

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,820
think about it and maybe when people

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,320
think about it we can change it

38
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,579
um so we have our audio networks

39
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,579
deployed well Abacus

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,200
um but also big broadcast situations so

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
think about Olympic games you've got

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,759
lots of stadiums lots of broadcasters

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,740
lots of different people you've got to

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,780
provide

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,360
um uh public address inside the stadium

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,000
for the people watching in the stands

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,940
and you've got to provide media streams

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
that all of the various television and

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,879
radio broadcasters can use to uh create

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,920
their coverage

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,580
um

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,340
and what tends to happen when you make

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,220
an audio network is uh that they extend

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,520
to places you don't expect them to go to

55
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,959
especially in places like theaters for

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,459
example

57
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,220
um it's increasingly common now that

58
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,379
your bathroom also has an audio feed

59
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,720
from the stage so you don't miss

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,220
anything when you go to the toilet which

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,220
is really convenient but now means that

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,080
you've got audio access inside your

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,060
bathroom

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,760
so that might be a problem thinking

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,900
about the things we're going to talk

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,319
about later

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,060
um and yeah any anybody who's got any

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,099
experience doing penetration tests or

69
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,080
novel bathrooms are quite a good place

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
to have plenty of private time with

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,459
network equipment

72
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,580
um okay

73
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,000
so why are we deploying these networks

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,819
uh because uh well no one deploys

75
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,440
technology just for the sake of it

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,879
unless you're at a hack a camp in which

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,920
case maybe you do

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,940
um

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,360
uh it's mostly well cost

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,019
um everything in AV is moving in this

81
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,000
direction

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,860
for IP based networking so you've got

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,379
art Nets on the lighting side you've got

84
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,840
various different video networking

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,200
standards and obviously ancillary stuff

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,500
so your show control everything is going

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,540
over IP networks nowadays so you can

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,940
save a lot of money by building one IP

89
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,459
based infrastructure and dragging one

90
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,000
set of cables inside your building

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,959
um

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,180
and that's that's pretty that's pretty

93
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,500
nifty

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,340
um

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,540
yeah

96
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,340
and if you're thinking about

97
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,720
[Music]

98
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,220
um

99
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,379
it's got It's I shouldn't touch my

100
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,080
microphone um it's um it's also more

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,159
versatile

102
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,620
um because you can share your audio

103
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,798
feeds a lot easier uh with multiple

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,560
places so sharing uh in the Olympics

105
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,899
again between the the

106
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,160
um

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,259
public address system in the stadium and

108
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,880
the multiple broadcasters outside it's

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
really easy

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,419
um you just sort of let them attach to

111
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:31,919
the network and then they can ask for

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,680
those uh audio feeds and it doesn't have

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,060
to go through any special box the

114
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,759
network takes care of of transporting

115
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,800
the audio there so it solves a lot of

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
problems it's it's very nice and it's

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,199
also really helps with consistency I

118
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,199
don't need a box of lighting cables a

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,000
box of audio cables and a box of

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,540
whatever else I just buy some single

121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,240
mode fiber and some Cat6 cables and some

122
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,479
normal little fairly normal switches and

123
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,300
and everything's good I can if something

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,039
breaks I can just go to the local it

125
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,680
supplier than probably buy a replacement

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,800
it's it's nothing which is uh special to

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,320
the AV industry anymore really which

128
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,259
really improves your business continuity

129
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,060
especially if you're touring and you

130
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,479
need replacements for things

131
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,820
okay so why am I going to talk about the

132
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,340
network and not the hundreds or maybe

133
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,620
thousands of insecure Linux devices that

134
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,139
are sat on the network uh

135
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,520
probably

136
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,419
um probably because it's more

137
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,020
interesting to me and uh because

138
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
a lot of people will already talk about

139
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,340
hacking in meta Linux devices and I

140
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,560
could do a separate talk on that but uh

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,740
but changing the network is going to uh

142
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,840
be a longer term goal because that

143
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,180
requires integration between multiple

144
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,520
different uh players of the industry

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,100
Hardware vendors software vendors and of

146
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,620
course adoption by by people and that's

147
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,160
that takes a decade at least even once

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
you've got once you've got a standard in

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
place to get that built into Hardware

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,960
um we're built into software updates and

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,139
and then actually deployed there's a lot

152
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,240
of work to be done so I thought I would

153
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,720
highlight the topic now and hopefully

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,440
um

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,120
and hopefully we can start to uh agitate

156
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,919
some change

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,259
so now I'm going to get into a section

158
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,460
where I'm going to run through some

159
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,960
attacks and we're going to build up

160
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
we're going to sort of build up the

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,020
knowledge we need to understand the

162
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,600
system one attack at a time so I've got

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,720
three different attacks and what kind of

164
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,900
attack objectives might we have

165
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,539
so we can damage people uh obvious way

166
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,340
to damage people is play something

167
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,020
really really loud and create hearing

168
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,639
loss uh less obvious way is just disrupt

169
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,639
for system during uh some kind of

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
emergency announcement and you can

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,900
create quite a lot of panic and then

172
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,620
you're really you're really uh gonna

173
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,240
have problems with panicking people you

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
get crushed people and that's that's not

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,699
great

176
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,419
um

177
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,620
and

178
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,039
um if you saw on the previous slides uh

179
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,960
we also deploy audio networks in

180
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,780
transport hubs like train stations and

181
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,960
airports uh so so definitely places

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,780
where you want your public address to uh

183
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,880
to work

184
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,819
um you can also damage equipment you can

185
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,360
uh play square waves out of speakers and

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,220
advanced users will pretty quickly burn

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,880
out if you play a sufficient amplitude

188
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,380
um

189
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,020
so yeah and then there's also a

190
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,660
reputational harm which which could go

191
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,520
together with snooping you've got a big

192
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,280
a big star and

193
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,860
um then you uh

194
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,199
get a recording of the microphone while

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
they're off stage doing something less

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
of an ideal or saying something less of

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,699
an ideal and uh well you've just you've

198
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,460
just got some blackmail material or uh

199
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,300
created a very sticky

200
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,460
situation and of course this information

201
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,340
if you can control versus the audio

202
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,379
coming out in especially a broadcast

203
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,599
situation

204
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,479
um then it's like in the movies I mean

205
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,180
you you can do whatever you like

206
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,400
um I mean you would hope you could and

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,740
but there's some soft bits on either

208
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,900
side where you probably could if you've

209
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,179
got time and effort

210
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,360
um time and motivation

211
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,279
so let's start off with snooping right

212
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,080
we've got we've got an analog audio

213
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,260
system here we've got a microphone a

214
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,040
stage box and and a mixing console

215
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,580
pretty pretty simple for you uh

216
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,279
there's an XLR cable that goes into the

217
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,080
stage box and then there's an extra

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,720
little snake or maybe uh ethernet cable

219
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,200
doing like aes50 which is not IP based

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,779
but but a special thing that also

221
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,240
happens to use ethernet cables into the

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,760
mixing desk and it's pretty pretty hard

223
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
to intercept that it's going to be

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,720
detected very very easily

225
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
um because if I unplug the cable the

226
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,399
audio stops the guy sitting at the front

227
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,959
of house is going to notice the audio

228
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,740
stopped uh it's it's hard to attack that

229
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,839
situation but let's make this a network

230
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,580
okay we've got to switch to a middle

231
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,440
great

232
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,420
um well now now I can now I can plug it

233
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,360
and unplug things uh without the guy

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,380
noticing necessarily

235
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,360
um that's that's already a start

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,880
so how how am I going to how am I going

237
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,620
to tap this

238
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,880
um and for that we're going to need to

239
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,100
explain uh unicaster multicast but

240
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,260
here's our attacker who's uh clearly

241
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,740
motivated to uh to spy on what's what's

242
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,940
coming out of his microphone

243
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,820
thank you

244
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,800
so just some quick background because I

245
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,540
also need to explain multicast because

246
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,600
uh in most Network situations multicast

247
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,820
is something you ban burn with fire and

248
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
then uh pretend doesn't exist but in

249
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,500
media applications it's quite necessary

250
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
unfortunately

251
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
um so so to explain it this is what

252
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,120
unicast looks like you send the same

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
feed multiple times from your source

254
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,519
which is great if you have a handful of

255
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,860
devices that need to receive this audio

256
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,279
send unicast feeds

257
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,779
it works you've got

258
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,079
uh but what happens with unicast is that

259
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,399
you start to consume all of your

260
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,200
transmission bandwidth on your source

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,839
and then you cause congestion and

262
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,880
especially in audio networks we don't

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,640
like congestion because congestion uh

264
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,320
basically increases our latency and

265
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,019
increases our Jitter and makes our audio

266
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,540
networks less stable and if we'd find it

267
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,240
operate in a load latency environment

268
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,779
for example doing a public address on a

269
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,320
stage when we need low latency somewhere

270
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
in the sort of under two millisecond

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
range would be nice

272
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,019
um

273
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,380
so so we have to send a different

274
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,980
um

275
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,899
difference between for each device and

276
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,480
this is this is

277
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,240
also somewhat vulnerable because you can

278
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,100
just alt spoof and then as long as you

279
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,620
forward the packets quick enough

280
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,540
um the the person on my desk might not

281
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,279
notice

282
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,240
um

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,800
but your but you have to be very careful

284
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,680
about your uh your forwarding uh because

285
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,620
the latency is quite sensitive so uh

286
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,720
expensive Network called Zol uh

287
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,579
advisable

288
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,200
um if you're going to Ops spoof and

289
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,399
Intercept unicast in an audio Network

290
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,120
um

291
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,579
but luckily for attackers well we use

292
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,220
multicast most of the time so uh so it's

293
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,500
actually much simpler

294
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,899
um so we've solved we've solved our

295
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:01,620
um

296
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,320
we've solved our problem of the source

297
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,360
transmission bandwidth because the

298
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,620
source just sends it into the network

299
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,139
and then it's the Network's job server

300
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,480
switch is in the network to understand

301
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,139
who is part of this multicast group and

302
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,620
who wants this network traffic on our

303
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,779
case audio

304
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,079
uh and the basic way that this works is

305
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,139
uh someone well usually the router or a

306
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,980
switch is a queer and it asks everybody

307
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,200
in the network what multicast groups

308
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,880
would you like to be part of

309
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,399
and uh then everybody in the network

310
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,139
replies with a list of the multi-gast

311
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,339
groups where they'd like to be part of

312
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,760
uh this traverses up the tree of

313
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,420
switches and you basically end up

314
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,360
receiving that multicast group so all

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,540
you need to do to Snoop on the audio is

316
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,279
plug into that switch from earlier say

317
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,160
look look find out which multicast group

318
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,360
has the audio you want in it and uh join

319
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
it and then you can pack it capture and

320
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Wireshark has a really handy tool which

321
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,399
will take an RTP stream and just turn it

322
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,100
into a WAV for you which is which is

323
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,250
pretty nifty

324
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,620
[Music]

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,639
um

326
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,860
so that's that's snooping it was very

327
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,940
easy

328
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,079
um

329
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,019
yeah so what else can we do okay we can

330
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,320
disrupt uh the network we can disrupt

331
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,820
audio coming out we can create audio

332
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,760
artifacts we can make we can make dodgy

333
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
noises come out of the speakers we can

334
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,860
we can just make the system not work

335
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,060
um which

336
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,880
depending on your objectives

337
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,220
could be interesting to you

338
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,579
uh so the the thing to attack here is

339
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,199
the clock on the network

340
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,839
clocking is extremely important on media

341
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,579
Networks

342
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,839
um because

343
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,120
um to get phase alignment for the 48

344
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,420
kilohertz uh audio stream so if you've

345
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,180
got 48 000 samples of audio per second

346
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,060
and that's that's your media clock when

347
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,940
you need a

348
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,060
accuracy for your wall clock uh within

349
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,320
um about one uh one microsecond

350
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,120
so it's a very

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,660
um

352
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,820
very high accuracy clock that you need

353
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,740
available in your network otherwise you

354
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,540
get phase alignment issues and then you

355
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,980
get uh various uh interference patterns

356
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,480
especially in AV setups um like this

357
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,660
so so if you even adjust the clock

358
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,399
minutely you're going to cause problems

359
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,820
for people

360
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,180
so how how are clocks distributed

361
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,959
um

362
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,639
Hammer clocks distributed on these

363
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,620
networks all they use for precise time

364
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,339
vertical it's it's in the name really

365
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,820
and what it what it does is it has a

366
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,199
leader which unfortunately in uh in IEEE

367
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,820
telemanology is called a grand master

368
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,440
but I will not use that term from here

369
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,519
on

370
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,420
um

371
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,959
this and this basically is the best

372
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,620
clock in the network uh theoretically

373
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,360
um and this shouldn't

374
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,800
in theory also be uh backed by uh gnss

375
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,279
so it should be a satellite device clock

376
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,940
uh and this is going to also help you

377
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,940
um when you come to stream audio between

378
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,759
multiple sites because the precise time

379
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,699
protocol only works within one Lan So

380
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,339
within one network within one site you

381
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,600
don't want to run the precise time

382
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,540
protocol anywhere else

383
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,279
um running a precise time protocol over

384
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,399
a um if a Wan will not go very well

385
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,160
because it basically calculates lots of

386
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,259
delays and sort of makes some

387
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,779
assumptions about how ethernet works and

388
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,620
um

389
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,480
it does a lot of

390
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,540
clever things and relies on a lot of

391
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,399
clever assumptions

392
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,079
um about how local area networks work

393
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,079
and it doesn't extend so well over over

394
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,279
um

395
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,259
over the Internet

396
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,820
um so

397
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,699
yeah that's

398
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,220
that's where that works anyway so uh

399
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,740
size time protocol you've got uh the

400
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,560
sort of main leader with the top of your

401
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,839
tree and then you might have uh boundary

402
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,459
clocks or transparent clocks in your

403
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,820
network and those are typically switches

404
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,980
uh and these uh

405
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,800
these um boundary clocks will basically

406
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,199
act as uh

407
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,380
they will listen to the to the leading

408
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,839
clock on one interface and then we'll

409
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,160
lead clocks on the other interfaces

410
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,100
which helps take load off your main

411
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,399
clock lead

412
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
um and advanced Batman clock is really

413
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,160
just about providing increased accuracy

414
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,220
uh which you'll find in newest which is

415
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,480
um

416
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,699
because it basically measures for time

417
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,699
but your packet is inside the switch and

418
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,559
then provides that information too which

419
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,740
is quite useful for uh understanding the

420
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,780
the delaying and vegetative on your

421
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,959
network

422
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,240
um yes

423
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,039
a code of walnuts

424
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,299
yeah

425
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,319
um

426
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,199
yeah so if you're if you want a lan it's

427
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,840
just PTP if you're on if you've got

428
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,940
multiple sites then because they're both

429
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,940
based off a satellite-based clock they

430
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,760
should be coordinated and pretty much

431
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
aligned so you can have a broadcast

432
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
coming from South Africa from streaming

433
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
it somewhere and mixing it in Brazil and

434
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,480
it should work just fine as long as

435
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,620
you've got uh access to satellite time

436
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,179
but

437
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,580
of course we can disrupt this clock

438
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,820
and then things will go wrong

439
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,460
so one option we have for disrupting

440
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,880
this clock is by bigging elections

441
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,000
because the leader the lead clock is

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,520
elected naturally

443
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,940
um based on its characteristics but not

444
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,460
just its characteristics it's also

445
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,679
elected based on two user-controllable

446
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,160
uh priority fields

447
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
um

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,919
and if you ever touch a media Network

449
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,419
you will probably find out very quickly

450
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,140
that you have to configure these uh in

451
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,600
order for it to work correctly

452
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,880
um you'll find a lot of media networks

453
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,919
where they basically denial of service

454
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,200
themselves because they're not properly

455
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
configured and the thing of it isn't

456
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
properly configured is uh if the

457
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,400
priorities in the

458
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,419
in the uh in the PTP announcements for

459
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,299
the for the election of clocks but in

460
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,220
reality if you're if you're an attacker

461
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,039
you can change all of these fields and

462
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
basically what you want to do is say I

463
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,780
have the lowest priority which is the

464
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,520
lowest number of priority gives you the

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,120
highest score in the election and

466
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,820
um you can sort of fake your accuracy

467
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,200
and instead of saying you have an

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
internal author later you maybe you can

469
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,280
save an atomic clock or something if you

470
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,500
really really want to be the clock so if

471
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,640
you want to be the clock it's pretty

472
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,500
easy to be the clock

473
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,860
um so you're the timelord now uh

474
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,120
great

475
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,740
um so if you want to make the clock

476
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,360
drift you can make the clock drift if

477
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,059
you want to make the clock jump you can

478
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,220
make the clock jump you can do whatever

479
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,760
you like and uh it's pretty much as

480
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,919
simple as running PTP for Linux on your

481
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,960
laptop and

482
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,539
have fun with that

483
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,760
um there's there's another option of

484
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,260
course

485
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,000
um you can you can do it in Isle of

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,820
service you can generate some traffic

487
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,840
but you don't have to turn away that

488
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,220
much traffic

489
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,260
um because because audio networks rely

490
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,020
on uh prioritization happening within

491
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,120
the switches to achieve uh different

492
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,159
amounts of latency and different traffic

493
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,919
classes basically

494
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,919
um so uh the clock is for most important

495
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,799
and this goes into the expected

496
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,179
forwarding class

497
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,120
uh the audio is the second most

498
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,740
important thing and this goes into a

499
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,240
short forwarding and everything else is

500
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,260
best effort and what this relates to is

501
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,780
for the switch typically has

502
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,080
a couple of cues like eight or so and

503
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,600
there there's there's a

504
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,940
basically some

505
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,620
there's basically a load balancing

506
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,260
algorithm that prioritizes certain cues

507
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,940
like the expected forward in queue over

508
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,860
the assured forward and Q and then via

509
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,380
short forwarding Q over the uh default

510
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,020
forward in queue and this basically uh

511
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,419
tries to make it under certain

512
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,039
conditions that you don't lose your

513
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,799
clock packets and that you don't very

514
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,059
often lose your uh lose your um

515
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,820
audio packets and the objective applied

516
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,039
to them is also lower

517
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,159
so all you actually need to do is send

518
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,000
um send enough traffic labeled

519
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,100
um

520
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,840
labeled with this field with the correct

521
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,440
value and then you uh fill up the queue

522
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,820
where the PTP should be going and when

523
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,820
you fill that vacuum and the PTP will

524
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
start to deteriorate quite quickly so

525
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,500
you don't need to saturate a lot of the

526
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,020
network to course

527
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,299
problems and if you're just aiming for

528
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,320
chaos then that will give you chaos

529
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,059
um

530
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,240
okay now we move on to possibly the most

531
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,940
interesting attack

532
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,340
uh types of

533
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,720
um

534
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,780
a first presentation

535
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,760
actually hijacking audio streams so how

536
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,280
can we get the speakers to play our

537
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,320
audio or how can we get the broadcast

538
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,418
station to play our audio

539
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,919
um so we've got first option which is

540
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,480
pretty

541
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,460
pretty trivial

542
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,159
um all of your audio

543
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,020
streams will be announced on the network

544
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,299
somehow

545
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,700
this example is a former Vena

546
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,559
implementation so it's using for such an

547
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,400
announcement protocol but uh

548
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,240
but you'll also see Dante using mdns but

549
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,799
it doesn't but that really doesn't

550
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,980
matter because fee always inside mdns

551
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,360
all the session announcement protocol

552
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,940
you will find the session description

553
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,880
protocol which is the same in both Dante

554
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,620
and Ravenna basically any audio foip

555
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,380
solution

556
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,080
um and what what you find in here is

557
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,140
um basically the multicast group where

558
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,159
where the audio is being sent to uh if I

559
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,260
have a port number and you find

560
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,860
um

561
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,720
some information about the time

562
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,940
synchronization

563
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,780
um

564
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,600
you'll notice uh the media clock direct

565
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,640
equals zero line

566
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,240
um this is an interesting

567
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,720
um in in Audi RTP the real-time

568
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,179
transport protocol that you if you have

569
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,880
a timestamp and this um there should be

570
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
a timestamp for your media clock

571
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,919
and according to the standard it should

572
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,080
start at a random number

573
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,120
um the idea was to uh

574
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,159
make uh plain Tech known plain text

575
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,200
attacks less possible if you if you

576
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,679
encrypted your your RTP traffic

577
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:53,940
um but

578
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,340
um in most implementations of audio

579
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,020
networks

580
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,440
um this is zero a few random interval is

581
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
pretty much always there so that's

582
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,600
that's just an interesting thing to note

583
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,340
so you pretty much you don't need to

584
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,900
take account of random intervals in

585
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,640
practice

586
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,380
um you have information you've got here

587
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,840
is basically what type of audio it is

588
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,159
and this is uh linear PCM 16-bit encoded

589
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,480
two channels at 48 kilohertz

590
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,700
if you have done any digital techniques

591
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,900
are you poorly new uh pulse at what PCM

592
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,520
audio is

593
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,179
um

594
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,059
you basically just measure the amplitude

595
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,020
of the signal and you measure it into a

596
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,039
16-bit value each time of any measure

597
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,980
with 48 000 times a second and then this

598
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,260
stream it's a stevio stream so we have

599
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,600
two channels of audio

600
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
and it also tells us what clock domain

601
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,860
we're in which is quite useful

602
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,918
um

603
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,880
okay

604
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,559
so what you can do here is you can just

605
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,240
make your own announcement

606
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,620
um and then you can make your own name

607
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,820
and um

608
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,740
wait for someone to click on it that's

609
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,779
possibly not so interesting but it will

610
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:13,919
probably work

611
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,440
um because there's no verification here

612
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
so the client will present all of them

613
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,520
equally and

614
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,260
um depending on the implementation of

615
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,260
your if your clients uh there will be

616
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,880
some caching of these messages and you

617
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
can probably abuse the caching of these

618
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,400
messages to make yourself higher in the

619
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
list and more likely to be clicked on

620
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
so that's one way of doing it which

621
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,919
would work when the stream is set up

622
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,140
but how do we do it when the Stream

623
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,640
is already running how can we attack

624
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,340
um something that's already running

625
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,340
um so we've mentioned already

626
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,580
um that we have uh latency on our

627
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,520
Network so it takes it takes time

628
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,400
uh for for a packet containing audio

629
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,039
data to get from our stage box to our

630
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,419
mixing console

631
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,760
and it takes different amount it takes a

632
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
different amount of time each time

633
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,200
um the variation of this different

634
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,720
amount of time is our Jitter so we can't

635
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,039
just we can't rely on uh on our Network

636
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,039
delivering something in constant time

637
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,020
which means we have to we have to buffer

638
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,700
when we're receiving when we're

639
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,380
receiving uh

640
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,080
when we're receiving audio data in our

641
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,700
mixing console we have to buff it we

642
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,840
have to have a buffer to uh with a fixed

643
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
offset

644
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,799
uh in time against against the clock

645
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,220
um

646
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,380
we need a fixed offset to ensure it's

647
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,179
it's real time playback otherwise would

648
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,400
be speeding up and slowing down each

649
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,260
time packets can arrive and they can

650
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,760
also revive out of order so we

651
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,220
definitely use the best of it

652
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,120
um

653
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,840
so

654
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,279
um so what we can what we can do is we

655
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,980
can we can abuse this this buffer and

656
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,720
this buffer will be biggest in broadcast

657
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,039
applications because in broadcast

658
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,559
applications you've got higher latencies

659
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,880
because you're typically going longer

660
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,440
distances over over wider Networks

661
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,419
um but you can if you've got sufficient

662
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,480
resources you can probably also do this

663
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
um on on a on us on a smaller Network

664
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,820
you just need to be very precise about

665
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,440
your timing

666
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,559
uh and um just to look at what what

667
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,419
package you're sending here it's it's a

668
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,360
real-time uh transport protocol there's

669
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,520
your timestamp which is based on your

670
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,320
media clock

671
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,539
um the sequence number which is fair

672
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,440
basically to detect packet loss and uh

673
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
in some applications of RTP you would

674
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
send

675
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,779
um

676
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,659
basically replies back occasionally

677
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,700
telling telling the sender how much

678
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,159
packet loss you've you've encountered uh

679
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,279
but in most applications

680
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,840
um you don't

681
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,380
um so

682
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,440
so that's not so important to us and

683
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,940
then your payload basically just

684
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,200
contains

685
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,980
um

686
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,880
it just contains your linear PCM encoded

687
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,020
audio

688
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,340
uh

689
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,059
interesting sort of fun fact here is

690
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,980
that you can list your contributing

691
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,200
sources

692
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,120
so if you've got multiple audio streams

693
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,039
being mixed into one audio stream you

694
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,080
can theoretically keep track of them but

695
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,020
I don't think anybody actually does that

696
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,080
um

697
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,039
yes so how how can we abuse this buffer

698
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,980
well we can basically play uh pixel

699
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,299
flute but we have with a deadline so you

700
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,100
basically just need you basically just

701
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,960
need your Pat your packet to be the last

702
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,399
packet that arrives

703
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,460
uh because there's no way to verify

704
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,880
um the packets coming in and you won't

705
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,440
likely to spend the time checking if

706
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,539
there's anything in your buffer already

707
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,399
um because why would you and even if you

708
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,320
did then it would just change for game

709
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,700
round

710
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,640
um so we can we can basically monitor

711
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,919
the network and see when our legitimate

712
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,799
source is sending packets uh so we sent

713
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,440
a packet and then

714
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,260
um we can offset our clock so we always

715
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,260
send a packet so that it arrives at the

716
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,299
destination just after

717
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,000
uh just after the legitimate packet of

718
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
lives but just before the clock comes

719
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,919
along

720
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,860
and then we get played back

721
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,419
and that's

722
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,860
um

723
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,919
that's that's basically how you do it

724
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,140
um almost Corpus working

725
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,779
um so I I hope at some point to have a

726
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,820
proof of concept published because it's

727
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,020
it's not that uh not that difficult

728
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,020
um to achieve especially on higher

729
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,419
higher latency setups

730
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,720
so let's start to summarize this a bit

731
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,059
um yeah so we've seen a couple of ways

732
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,740
that you can attack network audio

733
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,059
there's definitely more of them

734
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,919
and let's

735
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,760
um

736
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,380
basically just compare

737
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,320
yes okay so

738
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,799
um why are we in this state is is

739
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,179
interesting

740
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,220
um

741
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,679
the AV industry hasn't quite adapted to

742
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,140
the fact that earning networks yet

743
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,059
um they're running them

744
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,740
they don't understand the implications

745
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,320
of them yet and this this is a sort of

746
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,240
table which should help us understand

747
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,840
the differences and what we're expecting

748
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,740
um

749
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,200
so as we mentioned if you've got an

750
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,120
analog system a cable goes from point A

751
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,799
to point B

752
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,600
um this is you know it helps you with

753
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,539
traceability you just follow the cable

754
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:08,880
it helps you uh with controlling Ingress

755
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
and egress because if you unplug the

756
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,880
cable audio stops it's very detectable

757
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,559
and it creates

758
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,019
um and it creates an actual checkpoint

759
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,640
of a mixing desk where all of the audio

760
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,080
is definitely going through a mixing

761
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,559
desk because that's where the cables go

762
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,519
um

763
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,100
weathers on when you're using audio over

764
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,919
IP the network can basically be rooted

765
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,480
for the audio can basically be routed in

766
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,159
a matrix from any device on the network

767
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,200
to any other device on the network so

768
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,340
you've lost

769
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,080
that choke point

770
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,360
and the only way to really observe that

771
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,120
is to get your netflow data from all of

772
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,679
your switches which is not something

773
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,960
that audio Engineers are equipped to do

774
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,559
or particularly want to do so we need to

775
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,740
find some solutions to that

776
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,080
um what can we do in practice today

777
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,960
well a lot of views are sort of bad

778
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,480
solutions to problems we really

779
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,100
shouldn't have

780
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,659
um but you can do network monitoring and

781
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,960
if you've got a fixed installation

782
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,620
um

783
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,039
with a lot of resources then you can

784
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,140
probably afford to have a security team

785
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,720
look at your network occasionally

786
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,640
collecting data and figuring out what

787
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,980
normal looks like

788
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,679
um you can disable ports which

789
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,899
kind of works

790
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:28,679
um

791
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,299
in practice it's not going to happen

792
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,440
because

793
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,059
someone's going to plug something in

794
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,620
last minute complain but it doesn't work

795
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,380
then just enable all the reports again

796
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,700
um because that's

797
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,500
basically the Practical side of uh of Av

798
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,380
technology at the moment

799
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,539
you could try to implement 8021x on all

800
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,399
of your devices which has a bunch of

801
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,140
management overhead and your device is

802
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,760
fully didn't support it

803
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,919
and you could try to do MAC address

804
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,260
filtering but it really wouldn't be that

805
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,460
effective

806
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,840
um

807
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,779
yeah yeah we increase increase your

808
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,059
attack Time by 30 seconds or whatever

809
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,039
however long it takes you to notice it

810
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,220
was Mac address folding in place and uh

811
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,260
stalled spoofing your Mac address

812
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,659
then your other option is basically just

813
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,059
segment your network make sure that your

814
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,740
show control isn't running on the same

815
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,360
network as your audio make sure your

816
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,500
lighting isn't running on the same

817
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,320
Network and and just try to minimize

818
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,100
your your filter

819
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,340
so how's it moving of a light Direction

820
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,820
well PTP is getting better uh the the

821
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,880
clock can now be authenticated

822
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,659
um

823
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,100
which is helpful and the clocks can also

824
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,419
be validated against multiple clock

825
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:52,380
domains so now a PTP client can

826
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,820
um

827
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,460
can listen to multiple P2P clock domains

828
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,679
and then if one of those clock domains

829
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,120
is wildly out of sync with the other

830
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,580
ones that can rejected which is an

831
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,440
interesting concept now so it's kind of

832
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,260
a kevolvum based on based on what's

833
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,940
happening in your network and there's

834
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,359
also the option to do authentication

835
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,520
which which I don't think any of the

836
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,800
endpoints are really using yet but

837
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,918
um is at least a start

838
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,119
and this of course secure RTP the only

839
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,960
problem with secure RTP is that it's not

840
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,780
really got a solution to multicast yet

841
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,879
it kind of goes oh you could use it in

842
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,719
multicast but didn't Define any anything

843
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,839
about how you would use it for multicast

844
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,500
so that could be interesting

845
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,899
so what what we're missing basically is

846
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,960
is a usable way to distribute uh keys to

847
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
multicast groups

848
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,339
um and all of the software and Hardware

849
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,440
implementations were supported because

850
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,680
when we can distribute key material then

851
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,020
then we uh when we've solved a lot of

852
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,760
this problem

853
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,280
that's pretty much everything

854
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,300
um

855
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,480
yeah this is my own research but

856
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,540
um

857
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,700
my employer is also looking to hire a

858
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,500
lot of people so if you're looking for a

859
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,040
job in the making loud things then you

860
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,700
can

861
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,780
um

862
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,760
you can join holoporn we've got lots and

863
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
lots of jobs

864
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,240
really a lot of them

865
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,900
um

866
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,700
also if you just want to move to Berlin

867
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,280
it's quite a nice place to live

868
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,140
um yeah I think we might have some time

869
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,510
for questions

870
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:43,200
[Applause]

871
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,960
thank you very much for the more than

872
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,339
interesting talk

873
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,980
um well if you have questions please

874
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,540
line up at the microphones in the middle

875
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,640
of the tent and while you do that I have

876
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,280
one question would be a mitigation to

877
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,520
just switch back to XLR that is a

878
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,619
mitigation but I think I think the

879
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,280
industry has changed enough for it's not

880
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,240
going to happen anymore uh I think

881
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,880
I think one of the World Cups

882
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,640
like over a decade ago was already using

883
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,640
audio for IP so it's

884
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,020
um definitely in the higher end

885
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,960
applications it's it's already bare and

886
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,480
it's not going back

887
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
um so so that cat is out of the box but

888
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
that that cat is out of the box

889
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300
um but the only thing we can do now is

890
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
uh try to create a secure standard to

891
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,260
use

892
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,040
um

893
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,880
and try and get it implemented

894
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,220
questions from the audience you look

895
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,680
like knowledgeable people and it was a

896
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,560
highly technical talk any questions no

897
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
seriously

898
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,359
going once

899
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:55,098
yes please come up to the mic

900
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,300
so analog us to the XLR situation how

901
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,339
expensive and practical would it be to

902
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:03,359
just

903
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,700
apply only physical security to the

904
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,800
whole thing well that's an interesting

905
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,900
idea you could apply it only physical

906
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,480
security to it

907
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,200
um

908
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,480
but then you put a switch and a ceiling

909
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,339
tile above your bathroom and I don't

910
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,960
know whether you want to put a CCTV

911
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,740
camera in your bathroom like so I mean

912
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,300
like separating all of these things

913
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,800
because in the XLR situation yeah

914
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,320
everything was physically separated in

915
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,079
any way so isn't that like

916
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,240
but not the proper solution but yeah the

917
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,380
solution yeah I mean physical

918
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,020
separvation is is a good start and it's

919
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,599
going to minimize minimize your attacks

920
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
but think of the size of a venues that

921
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
exist nowadays there's always an

922
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,540
unprotected network access point

923
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,420
somewhere so you you're always going to

924
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,400
find something so there's a switch is in

925
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,140
front of house or switches behind stage

926
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,280
there's switches in the foyer outside

927
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,599
it's there's lots of different places

928
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,079
where unless you've got security walking

929
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,560
around the whole time on CCTV and you

930
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,300
know everything else you're going to

931
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,700
have a hard time controlling your

932
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,800
network perimeter

933
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,880
um you know it's not to say you

934
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,900
shouldn't try to control your network

935
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,200
perimeter you definitely should but

936
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,220
um

937
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,140
but the network perimeter I don't think

938
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,060
is going to keep people out

939
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,560
um and maybe

940
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,260
um also worth mentioning that in a lot

941
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,420
of these situations you've got contract

942
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,079
workers coming in with random laptops

943
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,359
um introducing random machines to

944
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,800
networks

945
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,300
um so you could you could you could come

946
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,460
in already with malware on the laptop if

947
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,520
it wants to export a specific thing and

948
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,820
probably if I may add um companies or

949
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,220
installations are not not keen to

950
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,000
implement twice the IP cabling for just

951
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,460
for all well well that's an interesting

952
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,640
point they actually do tend to tend to

953
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,260
build two networks

954
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,420
um

955
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,920
but not but not to separate not to

956
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,619
separate with different things uh they

957
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,359
tend to they tend to build two networks

958
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:09,300
because the way that uh the wave of

959
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,460
redundancy is done in these networks is

960
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,619
you build two completely independent

961
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,940
networks ones on like 192 168 100 24 and

962
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,140
one's on uh 200 slash 24 and

963
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,640
um and they

964
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,380
and they operate completely separately

965
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,720
and you that each device has a primary

966
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,640
and a secondary interface on it and you

967
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,160
send the same packet over both

968
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,859
um is is basically how redundancy works

969
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,079
on these networks so they tend to build

970
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,579
two but they don't tend to build it for

971
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,680
Network segmentation they build it for

972
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,180
practical uh redundancy reasons

973
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,880
want to follow up please go ahead like

974
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,920
if there's nobody else here

975
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,460
um so I think the question I would was

976
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,020
getting at was

977
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,440
um did the security actually decrease

978
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,859
with the digit like if you would put XLR

979
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,260
cables and audio cables through the hole

980
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,140
or through all of your buildings Etc

981
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,060
um or you would just put your digital

982
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,460
tiny cables in there did the security

983
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,560
actually decrease while moving to

984
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,859
digital cables

985
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,079
um I would say that it did because they

986
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,240
generally added more access points to

987
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,760
the to the to the network

988
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,380
um they generally put it in places it

989
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,660
wasn't before

990
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,619
um

991
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,720
yeah so they're generally used for

992
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,240
versatility that was added and by using

993
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,400
that versatility it was added increased

994
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,040
air exposure

995
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
um and also you've then got computers

996
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,780
which which just come into networks and

997
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,660
you can run a virtual sound card or a

998
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,760
new laptop and then put audio onto a

999
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,319
network

1000
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,800
um so it's it's not that difficult to do

1001
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,400
um

1002
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,880
and again these laptops come from

1003
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,760
you know private one-man PVE contractor

1004
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,240
turns up to do a gig uh poorly uses the

1005
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,099
laptop for other things

1006
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,599
um and then God knows what's on there

1007
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,720
excellent all questions answered anyone

1008
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,300
else we still got some time

1009
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,800
think about it

1010
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,599
