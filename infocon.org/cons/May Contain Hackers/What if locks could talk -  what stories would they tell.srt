[Music]

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
and what i want to talk about with you

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,800
today is what if logs could talk and

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
what kind of stories would they tell

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
so first talking with logs

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
isn't that a kind of silly

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
yeah maybe it is uh but i'm taking here

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,440
an idea from the chipwrest for people

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
that talk with

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
chips instead of locks

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,280
i could also talk a lot about about

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
history

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
different types of logs and different

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
types

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
so for example a lock in a certain place

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
what kind of stories were they over here

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,079
but that might be a talk for another

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,600
time

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
what i want to talk about is

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,440
side channels

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,079
and that's unintentional information

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760
leakage

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
specifically i want to talk about pin

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
tumbler locks and

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
safe combination locks

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
but side channel analysis and this

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,320
unintentional information leakage comes

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
from the world of cryptography

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
where you have a

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
where you have a theoretically secure

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
system but just because

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
people implement it in the real world

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
it's it's broken

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
or it's often broken

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,200
so i was already introduced but let me

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
just introduce a tool the open

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,040
organization of lockpickers

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
it's a hobby club of

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
lock enthusiasts started in the year

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
2002

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
we have 50 members here in the

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
netherlands at the moment

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
what do we have uh chapters across the

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
world we they are quite active in the

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,119
united states in the uk and in australia

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
here in the netherlands we have weekly

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
lock picking sessions

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
once every other week in amsterdam and

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
in eindhoven

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
and we also have a lock-picking village

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
at

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
clear voyance

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
so before we continue

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
i want to introduce the rules of log

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,440
picking

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
and the reason for this is just that

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
ethics is

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
very important to us

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
so pick your own locks

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
if you want to pick someone else's lock

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,560
please ask their permission

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
and when the lock is in use just find

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
another lock to pick so don't go pick

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
your own front door lock because you

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
might break it

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
or you could summarize this to

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
only pick your own logs uh

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
only pick

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
the locks you own do not rely on or and

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
can be

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,159
can afford to be without

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
the specific locks i want to talk about

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
are pin tumbler locks

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
and this is a very old

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,640
picture

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
of a

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
of a lock back in the 1850s

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
but it's still the same principle

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,720
today

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
the locks got better and the tolerances

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
got better

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
the locks got also a lot

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
a lot cheaper

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,159
the most common form is this euro

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
cylinder where we have a lock at each

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
side at the inside of the door on the

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
outside of the door

88
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,440
and it's connected together with a cam

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
in this presentation however i will

90
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,760
uh

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
use the the picture upside down

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
uh as where we have the the yellow

93
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
e that's our core

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
and then we have our pin stack of of two

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
uh two pins

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
but it's all the same i'm just using the

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
lock upside down

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
so when i have my lock

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
then i have the circle

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
it cannot rotate

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,399
because the blue pin this is a driver

102
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
pin is in the way

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
the red pin touches the key and the key

104
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
lifts it up to the to the correct height

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,880
and this height we call a shear line and

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,600
then it allows to to rotate

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
here's another view

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,720
where i took a slice of a lock with five

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,479
pins

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
here we have it with

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,719
without the key

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
and with the correct key we can lift the

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
pins to the correct heights

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,000
and the allow the core to to rotate

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
and then with the wrong key

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
it shouldn't allow it to rotate

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
so the first pin is correct and the

118
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
fifth pin is correct

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
but the second third and fourth pin are

120
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
are not correct

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
so how can we now

122
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,320
exploit

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,600
uh ex what can we exploit in this

124
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,639
lock

125
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
we have a few few different ways and the

126
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
first and foremost is the binding

127
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,320
binding of the pins

128
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
then we can also see stuff with the

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
rotation of the pins and there are a few

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
few

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,080
more so if i have my cylinder again

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
then i use a

133
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,639
turning tool just a piece of

134
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,039
of banned wire something like like this

135
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,160
and i use and i put slight pressure on

136
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
the core

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
if i want to rotate it just by applying

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,880
a torque on the core this way

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
what you would expect is that all of the

140
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
pins

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
of the driver pins prevent the lock from

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
rotating at the same time

143
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
but that isn't

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,479
true in practice in practice we only

145
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,280
find that one of the pins

146
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,239
prevents a lock from binding first

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,680
and here we often go for a graphic

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
with with wonky pins

149
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
we draw a line through it and you see

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
that some pins are

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
some pin chambers are

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
off center

153
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,160
either way

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
but this might just be a picture but

155
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
this is an actual

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
lock

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
it's sometimes these locks are just so

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
poorly made

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
that it's actually visible

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
but even if these

161
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
differences are sub sub micron then you

162
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
could still

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
you can still exploit it

164
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
these two pictures are from my friend

165
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
arty

166
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
and here we have a

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,919
a different core this is already a lot

168
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,360
more pristine a lot nicer made

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
but there you can see

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
around the

171
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
the holes you can see some

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
some damage some imperfections

173
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,000
and these were actually same as

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,479
as offsets

175
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
offset pin chambers

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
the same goes for the for the pins

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
these are quite well made

178
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
pins these are nice round and sharp but

179
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,879
you can still see some deformations and

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
some

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,919
some rounded edges there

182
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
but these are just two two very nice

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
examples there are also locks that look

184
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
a lot more like this

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
what we are looking at is a

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
cast sink core

187
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,440
this is one of the the cheapest ways to

188
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
make uh to make a lock core

189
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
and then pins like this

190
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
are not that nice

191
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,039
and

192
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,800
i will of course

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
give you different different feedback

194
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
so now we go for

195
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
to to pick the lock

196
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
again we have a

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
turning tool and we put slight pressure

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
on the on the core

199
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
then we use our lockpick

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,839
and then we start looking for

201
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
through the lock

202
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
and at some point we find

203
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
that pin 4 is harder to push up this is

204
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
our binding pin

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
we push it up

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
we hear a click

207
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,440
and we feel uh the core rotates just

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
ever so slightly

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
and that traps the

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
driver pin up

211
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
up above the shear line

212
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
and at this moment another pin starts to

213
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
bind

214
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
so it's just a question of rinse and

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
repeat

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
find the binder

217
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
it gives a click and a rotation and then

218
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,160
you want to find the next binary again

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
third pin doesn't bind

220
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
the fifth one was

221
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
and at this moment

222
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,320
the lock would rotate and open

223
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
so what tools do we need for to make

224
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,959
this happen

225
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,160
you can buy

226
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,440
big sets

227
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,959
like this

228
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
but usually you just want to start with

229
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
a very small set

230
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,640
this has all the things you need

231
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
it has a few lock picks and a few

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
turning tools and that's enough to get

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
you started

234
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
there are a lot of different shapes a

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
lockpicks

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
and each has a favorite

237
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,720
you could call it call it a religion

238
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
and

239
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
but for us for for tool it doesn't

240
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
really matter what kind of lockpick

241
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
relation you follow we accept all of

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
them

243
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
and arguably more interesting than the

244
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
lockpicking themselves are the turning

245
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
tools if i

246
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
were to make a lock picking set

247
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
then i rather have 20 turning tools

248
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
because all different kind of shapes

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
work in different types of locks

250
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
than to have one turning tool and 20

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
different

252
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
lock picks

253
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
so how do we use these

254
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
lock picks

255
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
well if you hold it like this

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
then

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
it doesn't really work for for lock

258
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
picking

259
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,240
better way would be to

260
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
hold it like a writing supplement

261
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,120
and for me this this one works

262
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
this gives me the most control over over

263
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,319
the lockpick

264
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
as it gives me

265
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,680
a

266
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
nice nice control

267
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,439
over over the picking tip

268
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
as for the turning tool

269
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,519
you want one that fits the keyway

270
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,399
very nicely so this one is

271
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,200
too small too thin and it falls in the

272
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
keyway and blocks

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,319
and blocks the access to the pins

274
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
a better one is already

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
this one so this is a thicker

276
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
turning tool and it fits very snugly

277
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
in the top of the keyway and this gives

278
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
all the access we need to the pins

279
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,360
notice also here i'm using my

280
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,839
index finger because it gives me the the

281
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,040
best

282
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,880
leaf leverage

283
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
at the best control over my

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
over my tools

285
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
if you were to use your

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
lockpick

287
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
your turning tool like this

288
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,399
then it wouldn't give you as much

289
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,680
control

290
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
as as you would want and you get quite

291
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
cramped and you get frustrated

292
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,600
and then you might not pick this lock

293
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,830
[Music]

294
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
just just as a quick demonstration here

295
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
i have a lock and a turning tool

296
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,279
i put it in

297
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
in the lock in this case i'm using my

298
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
thumb not my

299
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
not my index finger

300
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
and when i start to pick locks

301
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
like this then it doesn't give me much

302
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
control so i want to have a very small

303
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
loop my hands are

304
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,079
touching

305
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,279
and this gives me a lot of control over

306
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,680
over a lockpick

307
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
yes demonstration effect

308
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,800
okay

309
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
it it does work it's just hard to

310
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
demonstrate

311
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
so that was just the the start of

312
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
getting started in in the lock picking

313
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
but what other feedback can we get from

314
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,440
the from the lock

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,560
well this lock has been picked

316
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
so maybe i don't know if this sounds

317
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
can be picked up

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
but the pins are loose

319
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
so you can't can hear this so you can

320
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
hear your your progress

321
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,920
we have already seen that we have seen

322
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
the non-binding pins

323
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,240
just a pin that just springs back

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
we have seen the binding pins

325
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,480
and we have here the loose key pins

326
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
there are two interesting ones one is

327
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,920
where the driver pin is a chair line

328
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
this is where the key pin is loose but

329
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
you can get a slight wobble of the

330
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,399
driver pin

331
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
because it is at

332
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
its airline

333
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
and the other one is where we overset a

334
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
pin

335
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
so here we have the same

336
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,519
lock picking slides as before

337
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
but in this case

338
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
i'm pushing my binding pin too far

339
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
and my key pin is currently at shear

340
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
line

341
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,519
so no matter how far i put push the

342
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,880
fifth

343
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,079
key pin

344
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
it will never get unstuck

345
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,079
so the only way to to get

346
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,720
get back your your progress is to

347
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,839
release

348
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,880
pressure on your turning tool

349
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,079
and

350
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
hopefully just reset one or two pins but

351
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
sometimes it resets

352
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,360
the whole look

353
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
where it gets interesting

354
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
and this is also a bit beyond the scope

355
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,839
of this presentation

356
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
is where we have

357
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,199
security pins

358
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,639
these are

359
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,959
um

360
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
these are very pristine these are very

361
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,399
sharp

362
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,920
sharp pins

363
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,399
and each pin will give you different

364
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
types of of feedback

365
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
as we don't know the real names we

366
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
usually go quite descriptive

367
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
for example the second from the bottom

368
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,920
and the

369
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,399
fourth from the bottom it looks like a

370
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
torpedo so we call it the torpedo pin

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
but because it's a key pin

372
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
i would it shouldn't interact with the

373
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
lock picking at all

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
unless we

375
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
we overset

376
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,639
set the pin

377
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
here are a few more examples

378
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,959
of

379
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,639
of different types of

380
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,839
different types of pins

381
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,360
and most notably is the third and the

382
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
fourth pin

383
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
fourth

384
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
driver pin

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and because it has

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
rings

387
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
on top of it

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
so usually these things are not

389
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
necessarily anti-picking but it does

390
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,599
give us a nice

391
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
give us a nice

392
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,039
challenge

393
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
so let's now go to

394
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,760
mechanical combination locks

395
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,520
specifically i want to talk about spring

396
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,559
lever combination locks of the type

397
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,160
group 2

398
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
where the group

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
is just how difficult it is to

400
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
to manipulate

401
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
either it's 2 hours manipulation

402
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
resistant or

403
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
or better

404
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,559
the target we have is the sardine green

405
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,600
leaf 6730 this is one of the most common

406
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
locks of this type

407
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
and it's

408
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
it's not that common here in

409
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
in europe

410
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
but it's more common

411
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,840
in the united states

412
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
it's a trivial combination lock

413
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
and it has a theoretical 1 million

414
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,039
combinations

415
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,160
but in practice it's it's a lot less

416
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
here we have the lock

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,480
i mounted it on a nice

418
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
piece of wood

419
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
but you could find this

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,280
mounted on on a safe

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,400
you have the dial ring that's mounted

422
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
mounted to the safe

423
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,400
and you have the dial

424
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
which has the numbers as 0 to 99 on

425
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,880
there

426
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
and you dial the numbers to the

427
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
indicator

428
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
on the back of the lock we have the

429
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,160
locking

430
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
mechanism

431
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,480
and

432
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
this is already quite

433
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,559
quite complicated

434
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
but what we have is we have a bolt we

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
want to retract the bolt

436
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
but the lever doesn't allow us to

437
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,919
retract the bolt

438
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
so what we do is we dial the correct

439
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,559
combination

440
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,200
then the lever can fall in to the to the

441
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
lever pack

442
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,000
and move backwards and retract

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
the bolts

444
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
if we take a look at the wheel pack

445
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,360
we see there are

446
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,640
three wheels and one cam

447
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,120
and each wheel has a

448
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
gate

449
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,000
the cam then is connected to to the dial

450
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
so that's the only thing we can really

451
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
manipulate

452
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,640
on

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
on this

454
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,240
lock

455
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,159
the cam has

456
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,159
this protrusion

457
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,240
and it's after one rotation it picks up

458
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
the next

459
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,320
the next wheel

460
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,960
and with these bits

461
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,280
after rotation of the wheel it picks up

462
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
the next wheel after a rotation again it

463
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,919
picks up the next the next wheel

464
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
for the lever

465
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
we have two interesting parts

466
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,120
one is is the nose and the nose right

467
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,240
over

468
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,840
the cam

469
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
and we have the fence and the fence

470
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
drops into the the gates of

471
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
the gates of the wheels

472
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
are something like

473
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,879
this

474
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,799
this is just the the normal operation of

475
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,679
the lock

476
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,840
this isn't anything

477
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
secret

478
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,159
when we want to open the lock

479
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
we first need to rotate

480
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
the dial four times

481
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
to the left that's

482
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
counterclockwise

483
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
and then stop at the first number

484
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
then we downright three times to the

485
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
second number

486
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,919
then left twice to the last number and

487
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,480
then right past zero to open log if the

488
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,159
lock doesn't open

489
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,760
then

490
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,000
we didn't endow the the correct

491
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
combination

492
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
so what you can already do with this is

493
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,919
build a robot and start dialing every

494
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
combination

495
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
it's done you can

496
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
but it's also quite

497
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
boring

498
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,159
there must be any more interesting and

499
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
more clever way

500
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
of

501
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,679
of

502
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,799
of defeating this lock

503
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,440
so what's the side channel well we can

504
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360
indirectly measure the wheel's height

505
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,159
and here we say that the lower reading

506
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
is a better guess

507
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,799
so what you can imagine is if i put all

508
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,320
gates under the fence

509
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,480
then that's the lowest reading possible

510
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,200
but if the reading is lower than before

511
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,760
then maybe i have some gates

512
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,879
under um

513
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,720
some gates on the under the fence

514
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
so how do we measure

515
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
the wheel's height

516
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
we do this by

517
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,679
by finding the contact points of a lock

518
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
and these are usually around

519
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
5 and 15.

520
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,799
so we have the the cap

521
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,760
and the nose falls in to the cam

522
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
then

523
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,799
while dialing

524
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,960
the cam comes around

525
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,320
again and pushes the

526
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,200
the lever nose out of this hole

527
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,679
and this is what you can can feel

528
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,480
where the right contact point is a nice

529
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
gentle slope

530
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,159
and the left contact point is

531
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,760
quite a solid

532
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,158
spot

533
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,960
for this one i've also created some

534
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
graphics

535
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
um

536
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
where gray is our wheel

537
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,240
and the ball is our lever nose and the

538
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,840
ramps are contact points

539
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,559
so we can measure

540
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,240
the position of the right contact point

541
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
we can measure the left contact point

542
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
and

543
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,799
calculate

544
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,520
the distance

545
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
then when we have a better guess

546
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,440
our wheel is low wheel pack is lower

547
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
and we measure right and left again and

548
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
again have a distance and it doesn't

549
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,039
take much to see that

550
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,600
the green line is shorter than the red

551
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
line

552
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
so how is this in practice

553
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,399
here i have a

554
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
here i have a combination lock

555
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,000
in this case it's a cutaway so we can

556
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
see more of more of the lock

557
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,799
and i've not placed any gates under

558
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
the

559
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
have not placed any gates under the

560
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
defense

561
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,159
so this is the highest reading it will

562
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,440
ever ever give us

563
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
and we see

564
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,159
that

565
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
on the contact point reading we see that

566
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
the value is

567
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,480
13 13.25

568
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,440
but now i do exactly the same and i put

569
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
a

570
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
gate under wheel three

571
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,760
and now the reading is just

572
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,440
ever so slightly different

573
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
it reads at 13 at this moment

574
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,159
so again

575
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,440
this is

576
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
13.25

577
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
and this is 13.

578
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
so these

579
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,200
differences are so small

580
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,400
it takes uh quite some precision

581
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,520
we do this usually by eye because we

582
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,200
think this is a fun game fun challenge

583
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
but you could also amplify this with

584
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,400
with electrical means

585
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,799
traditionally we would do

586
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
1 8 of a digit

587
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
but

588
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,039
if your

589
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,279
your eyes are more calibrated to one

590
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,159
tens

591
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,960
of increments that works as well

592
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,120
but you want to stick to to the same

593
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,760
to the same measuring scheme every time

594
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,520
so how can we get this information from

595
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
the lock

596
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
let's perform a

597
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,000
an algorithm and we call this algorithm

598
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,440
all wheels left

599
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
for this we dial four times to the left

600
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,200
and stop at a number

601
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,760
we call n

602
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,960
then we measure the the contact points

603
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
then we dial left to n plus two and a

604
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,559
half

605
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
and then we measure the contact points

606
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
again

607
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,080
we do this as long as it takes to to

608
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
complete the graph

609
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
it

610
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,799
doesn't take long

611
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,880
sometimes it takes 10 minutes sometimes

612
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,279
half an hour

613
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,320
but you want to have a complete graph

614
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
without the complete graph you it will

615
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,520
just

616
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
mess up your

617
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,879
your manipulation

618
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,760
so here's an example graph that i dialed

619
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,000
every 10 every five steps

620
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,159
and what we're looking for is the global

621
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,760
global minimum

622
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
and that's

623
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,360
for this lock at this point

624
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,880
okay

625
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,159
now we know the global minimum

626
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,080
what what's next

627
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,840
well we need to figure out

628
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,919
on which wheel

629
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
on which wheel this global

630
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,760
this minimum point lives

631
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,679
and we can do this by process of

632
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,480
elimination

633
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,960
we know our

634
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,840
original dialing sequence is 80 left 80

635
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
left 80 left and i'm just changing one

636
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,880
of them to 70 right

637
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
and what we see

638
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,360
is that if we change

639
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
the

640
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,640
if we don't change the the last wheel we

641
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,600
find

642
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
the lowest reading

643
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,679
so our

644
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,720
so our 80 left is on our last wheel

645
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
with this information we can then

646
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,919
continue

647
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
making more drafts we don't know if 80

648
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,120
left

649
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,480
on wheel 3 is our

650
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
is our gate but we at least know it's a

651
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
better reading than we had

652
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
before

653
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,919
so for this one i'm dialing right right

654
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,960
80 left so that's four times to the

655
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,799
right

656
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,840
two times to the left to

657
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,480
and then to the right again to get my

658
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,279
contact points

659
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
and this is then the graph

660
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,159
that i got

661
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,120
where this spot is the most

662
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
is the most interesting

663
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,200
because again it's the

664
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,159
global minimum

665
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,159
again we perform the same test as before

666
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,880
we just have less variables

667
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
so we only need to find

668
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
we only need to dial it twice

669
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,000
and we found that our second number is

670
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,039
50 right

671
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
at this point we can

672
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
make more graphs

673
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
we can

674
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,440
start re-forcing the last number because

675
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,320
we are

676
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,200
such

677
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,720
confidence

678
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,440
about our

679
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,760
our finding of the gates that we say 50

680
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,158
right and eight left arcades so

681
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
and that's then also what i did for to

682
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
finish this manipulation

683
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,000
process

684
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,120
so we have brute forcing left 50 right

685
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
80 left

686
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
are the lock opened at 20

687
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,880
giving us the solution

688
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
so what you want to do

689
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,840
is to note the dialing direction

690
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,240
if you find a global minimum by dialing

691
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
left

692
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,679
then keep

693
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
keep this number

694
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
the same because 80 left and 80 right

695
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,239
might not yield the same results

696
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,279
also you want to be very precise

697
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,720
and consistent

698
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,200
you want to check every n

699
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
numbers

700
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
and digits

701
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
and that depends on what lock you're

702
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,200
working with if it is a sloppy

703
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,679
tolerances then two and a half might be

704
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,480
fine

705
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,320
but for some locks

706
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,519
one or one half or two might be better

707
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,919
numbers

708
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,360
if you're inconsistent with either the

709
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,799
dialing or with the graphing

710
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,120
you will also mess up your data you will

711
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
introduce a lot of

712
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,360
noise

713
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
and the last one the most important one

714
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,200
is

715
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,840
lower

716
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,919
numbers lower numbers are good but it

717
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,600
doesn't have to be a gate

718
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,799
so if your graph shows you a low number

719
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,158
then you're making a progress

720
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
let me just demonstrate this one

721
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,960
with a much

722
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
more difficult

723
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,159
much more difficult look

724
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,519
so here i performed

725
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,080
an all wheels left operation and i found

726
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
80 as my lowest number

727
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,039
but it was quite inconsistent and i

728
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,240
couldn't really feel if it was really 80

729
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,679
80 left

730
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,080
so i also performed

731
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
an all-wheels write operation so it is

732
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,279
just the same as the

733
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,799
oreos left

734
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,840
i just

735
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,039
by turning

736
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,000
the other direction

737
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
with this graph

738
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,519
i found that 75 was an interesting

739
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,399
interesting spot

740
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,519
and i chose it

741
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,480
i chose it as my number and i found it

742
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,640
it lived on the

743
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,519
third wheel

744
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
and i performed

745
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,000
the operation left left 75 right

746
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,039
and i got this

747
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,559
i got this graph so again it's a lower

748
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,799
global minimum so we're making progress

749
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,760
i chose

750
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,240
65 as my

751
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,559
first and my second

752
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,158
at digits and i redid my graph for

753
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
by rotating to the right so that's 65

754
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,039
left 65 left

755
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,159
and then

756
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,799
make a graph to the right

757
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,760
and i found a new global

758
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,799
global minimum

759
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,559
i then found that this global minimum

760
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,039
was on wheel 3

761
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,120
again by the process of elimination

762
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,840
and made the graph

763
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,079
the left left

764
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
80 right

765
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,560
and this gave me a very nice

766
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,440
global minimum around digit

767
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
50.

768
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,599
this then lives on the second wheel

769
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
because of the process of elimination

770
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,719
and then i created a graph

771
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,879
starting all the way at 100 and down to

772
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,918
zero

773
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,159
and the lock opened at

774
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,760
20.

775
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
but with every graph

776
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,480
i got closer

777
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,480
this one took me

778
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,199
quite a long time more than

779
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,159
a couple of hours over

780
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
over several days

781
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,399
instead of just

782
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,000
half an hour for the other one

783
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,880
so don't give up

784
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,920
because each graph got us closer to

785
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
an open

786
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
if you want to play with this

787
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,920
we have some locks at the

788
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
lock picking village

789
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
both for lock picking and for

790
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,079
for safe manipulation

791
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
you can also just buy

792
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
safe locks

793
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,680
like the sergeant green leaf 6730 they

794
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
go for around

795
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,960
100 euros

796
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,400
but you have to quite likely to import

797
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
them from the united states

798
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,920
one alternative is to get a virtual

799
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
practice lock

800
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,280
and these are quite cheap this is just a

801
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,599
program

802
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,359
it's not a game it's sold as a game

803
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,680
you can get it on hio or steam for just

804
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,480
3 euros

805
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
so you get a nice box

806
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,520
with a fertile lock on there

807
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,280
and there are different

808
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,480
different modes you can can play through

809
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,880
but this will already give you a lot of

810
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,640
the same feel and the same

811
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,240
same process as a real lock would give

812
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,680
you

813
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,800
the only difference is that this fertile

814
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
lock

815
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,680
is

816
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,520
too perfect

817
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,800
so it might not

818
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,040
so it might be

819
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,240
a little harder to

820
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,200
to manipulate

821
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,280
what this

822
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
fertile lock also allows you to do is to

823
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,640
get

824
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,720
get more tools out

825
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
so it has x-ray it has magnification it

826
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,320
also has some

827
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
gyroscope gizmo

828
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,359
that gives you very precise

829
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,480
readings

830
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,560
and also some

831
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,000
spectrogram

832
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,320
thing

833
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,280
it's a definitely a nice nice tool

834
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,520
and it also allows you to do

835
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,400
dumb things like this lock

836
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,200
with more than 20

837
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,680
20 wheels

838
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,320
so let's wrap this one up

839
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
if you want to know more about

840
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,440
manipulation i would suggest

841
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
of course coming to lockpicking village

842
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
but also reading the book a naturals

843
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,119
knocksmith's guide to manipulation

844
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,680
and if lockpicking is more your thing

845
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
and it got your interests then

846
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,440
definitely get a copy of logsport a

847
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,079
hacker's guide to lock picking

848
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,720
impressioning and safe cracking

849
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,240
when it's out

850
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,440
hopefully in

851
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,079
a couple of months

852
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,720
and notable people that wrote this book

853
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,640
are of course jose veyers you might

854
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,119
recognize him and

855
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,160
walter

856
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
velgas

857
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
[Music]

858
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,160
so this is the end of my presentation

859
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,240
i noticed that they talked way too quick

860
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,000
thank you

861
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:51,200
[Applause]

862
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,119
thank you very much

863
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,480
this is really interesting it's the

864
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,760
first talk i've seen on manipulating

865
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,680
saves in this way

866
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,440

hello hello

872
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,480
yep that was a very nice talk thank you

873
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
um i was wondering is there a certain

874
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,960
brand or a certain type of lock that you

875
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,680
really want to get

876
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
uh

877
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,599
that's a good question i'm

878
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,680
quite a lock collector

879
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,119
so i

880
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,800
look on ebay

881
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,000
all the time

882
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,839
and at the moment

883
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,160
there aren't many locks that i don't

884
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,359
have

885
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,240
except for very very expensive

886
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,920
locks

887
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
for

888
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,760
the

889
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
safe tracking for example there are a

890
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,280
few

891
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,599
government restricted locks that they

892
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,480
just won't give me

893
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,280
thank you

894
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280
i had a question about the

895
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,000
the pins for the tumbler look

896
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,839
you

897
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,160
said uh one of the pins had a disc

898
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,040
but wouldn't a disc make it more easy or

899
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,839
uh

900
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,000
easier to lockpick because then you have

901
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,319
two different

902
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:20,700
um

903
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,920
[Music]

904
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
distances where you can

905
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,680
get it in a gate

906
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
one question i'm taking

907
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,160
the slides

908
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,280
this one yes correct yes

909
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,599
um so what this

910
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,160
third and this fourth pin has

911
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,720
it has the discs are movable

912
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
but there's still one element

913
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,119
oh correct okay so you still have to set

914
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,880
the whole element in its entirety

915
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,760
but every disk will give you

916
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,480
as if the pin was

917
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,160
either

918
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,078
not binding at all or it was

919
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
or it gave other feedback

920
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,680
yes thank you

921
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
thank you for the talk really

922
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,880
interesting um it's not an interesting

923
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,960
question though but i do want a bit of

924
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
advice um can you recommend a good lock

925
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,400
for my bike

926
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,560
um

927
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,440
can i give a

928
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,640
advice on securing your bike

929
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,319
well that depends on your your treadmill

930
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,000
so what kind of bike thief are you are

931
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,200
is after your your bike

932
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
there are definite

933
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,240
um definite answers and the most easy

934
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,839
one might be just a look at what your

935
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,800
what your insurance recommends

936
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,720
and then if you don't trust them don't

937
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,200
just one-up them

938
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,920
it's the art standard

939
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,720
where three is for bikes and 4 is for

940
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,440
motorcycles i don't know the exact

941
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,280
numbering screen

942
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,400
but if you have art5

943
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,359
then this bike goes nowhere

944
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,560
all right thank you

945
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,200
you were talking about um the

946
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,960
combination locks

947
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,839
and

948
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,680
you were talking about having like a

949
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,520
half set on a gate

950
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,040
and i was wondering how that works

951
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
because in

952
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,280
as i understand combination looks all

953
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,560
the discs are the same size

954
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
so

955
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,839
even if you've got one gate in the right

956
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,280
place

957
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,880
isn't it supposed to

958
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,760
not like is defense not supposed to not

959
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,200
drop anything

960
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,119
or is this just

961
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,960
the same as the tolerances that you

962
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,000
mentioned

963
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,280
in a tumblr logs

964
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,480
so if i get your question correctly

965
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
if you have

966
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,640
more wheels

967
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
and one of them shows a gate and another

968
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,880
does not show gate

969
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
then would it not

970
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,359
not show you anything yes yes

971
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,560
that's again

972
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,520
if we lived in a perfect world

973
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,640
so

974
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,040
this fence might is just

975
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
one piece of metal soldered on another

976
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,440
piece of metal and this might be not at

977
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,839
the correct angle

978
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,359
um also these logs are made to function

979
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,280
in the real world

980
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,119
so they might not be

981
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,839
totally totally round or

982
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,240
um there's there's so many tolerances

983
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,359
right and

984
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,319
um in in practice it works

985
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,319
but sometimes you find a lock that's a

986
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
lot harder to

987
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,880
uh to manipulate than another lock and

988
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
this is because then the tolerances were

989
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,960
way smaller

990
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
either the tolerances are way smaller or

991
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,880
it's just a lock of the draw where the

992
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,599
as they say the stars aligned and this

993
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,800
one's

994
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,599
good lock was produced in the factory i

995
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
see thank you

996
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,560
if there are no further questions i have

997
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
one small question

998
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
i understood that for tool you need two

999
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,560
references

1000
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,960
can you be the other

1001
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,800
do you need references for to become a

1002
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,079
member

1003
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,119
uh no if you if you just email us at

1004
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,119
info tool.net or visit our website or

1005
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,960
join a discord or

1006
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,720
join the lockpicking village and mention

1007
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,119
that you want to become a member

1008
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,880
that's definitely

1009
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,440
possible okay uh there has been

1010
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,240
we don't want everyone to become a

1011
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,440
member but

1012
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,920
everyone here in the room has already

1013
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,319
shown such interests

1014
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,720
in the topic okay thank you very much
