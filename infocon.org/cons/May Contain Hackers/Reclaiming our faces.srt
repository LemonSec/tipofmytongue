2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
my

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,359
and i will start

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
with talking about my journey of

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,519
two nf5 at 2.5 years

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,960
about bugging

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,720
the face search engine clearview ai

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
so probably the most of us leave photos

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
somewhere on the internet because we

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
want to share them with friends and

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
family some of us appear in the media or

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
work at a company where your face

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
appears on the website

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,719
and

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,280
the meter information leak information

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
about you because

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,079
sometimes those websites tell about your

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
political opinion your sexual

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
orientation or

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480
who your employer is stuff like that

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,120
and face search engines crawl the

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
internet take all those photos and make

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
them searchable based on biometric data

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
which is nice because you cannot really

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,920
hide from it so even if you change your

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
face a little or even if you delete your

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
photo after a while the face search

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
engine might still know about this

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
and yeah this is

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
maybe a problem

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,439
and in early 2020 we learned about the

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,079
company clearview ai there was this

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,320
wonderful new york times article about

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,880
this company that might end privacy as

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
we know it and it told the world about

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,799
clearview ai the face search engine for

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
law enforcement but also for private

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,360
people at that time

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
and at this time they had about three

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,119
billion photos in their database

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,000
and one product they wanted to build

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
were for example smart glasses so i just

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
could use these glasses look into your

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,640
face and the smart glasses would tell me

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
who you are where you work at and

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
what you what you like in bed for

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
example

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,599
and today this company clearview ai has

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,680
about 20 billion photos in its database

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
and they

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,599
they are aiming for 100 billion by end

52
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,238
of the year

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
so yeah their goal is to be able to

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
identify every single one of us

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,519
um two days after this new york times

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
article i

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
sent a data subject access request to

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
clear ai because i had reason to believe

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
that they have data about me because

60
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,360
there are some photos of my face on the

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
internet for example this photo and i

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
used this photo

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
to ask clearview ai for my data i simply

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
wrote an email and after about a week

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,000
they asked me to confirm my identity

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
i gladly ignored this request i do not

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
recall why but i know that i never

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,519
replied but still

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,599
about a month later in february 2020

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
they

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
completed my data access request and

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,879
provided the search results for my face

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,000
and they also told me that they deleted

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
the image that i shared beforehand to

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
initiate this request

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
and this is the search report they

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
prepared

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
for this search image that i provided so

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
they dropped the search image a little

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
and they found two photos

81
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
that a photographer uploaded without my

82
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
consent to a stock photo website

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
and

84
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,200
here you can see the photos that were

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
shared online

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
i participated in a student's

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
and there were media reports on this so

88
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,799
that is why those photos were

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
on the internet

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,599
in my without asking i got another

91
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
another search report by clearview ai so

92
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
in fact they did not delete the search

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,440
image that i provided and this time they

94
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
included eight more faces in the search

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
report and those pictures did not show

96
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,639
me so clearview ai is far from

97
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
being perfect and here they included

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
lots of images from a russian social

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
network but also from

100
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
instagram

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
and they

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,919
and

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
additionally to those photos they

104
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
provide the url and also the title of

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
the web page

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
so you can often learn the name of the

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,360
person for example

108
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
i learned that clearview ai has in fact

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
data of my person biometric data and

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
they were using this biometric data

111
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
without my explicit consent and because

112
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,759
of that i wrote a complaint to the

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
hamburg data protection authority

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,440
and

115
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
a second minor issue was that the

116
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
answer clevelai provided to me was not

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
complete but the main issue is that they

118
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
are processing my biometric data without

119
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,080
my consent and to my big really big

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
surprise the handbook dpa

121
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,720
simply told me yeah gdpr is not

122
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,240
applicable we can do nothing

123
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
so let's have a look at this

124
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,680
um

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
if we look at clearview ai we will

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
notice that there is some automatic

127
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
processing because they are crawling the

128
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
internet

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
it might be true that clearview ai has

130
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
no office within the union but there may

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
be

132
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
might be some customers within the

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
european union we will learn about that

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
later

135
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,520
and they are monitoring behavior of

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
european citizen because if you

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,919
regularly share photos of yourself on

138
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,400
the internet and clear your ai crawls

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
the internet over and over again

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
they will have a very good profile

141
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
profile of the things you do

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
then there is article 9 which is about

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
more sensitive data and biometric data

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
are sensitive data under gdpr they are

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
under

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
special protection and

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,080
clearview ai is not allowed to use this

148
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
data without your explicit consent so

149
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
here we have the applicability of the

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
gdpr again

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
and

152
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
there

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
could have been some exceptions under

154
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
article 6 but

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
clearview ai is running its service only

156
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
to earn money so

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
this processing of biometric data is not

158
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
necessary with respect to article 6 of

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,319
the gdpr

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
that is more or less what i answered to

161
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,680
the hamburg data protection authority

162
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,479
i'm not a lawyer so i just read some

163
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,039
articles and wrote the email as an

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
answer to the hamburg dpa

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
and they changed their mind they agreed

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
then that

167
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,599
the gdpr is applicable it might have

168
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
helped that i talked to a journalist

169
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
from the german

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,319
media

171
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
spiegel

172
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,639
and

173
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,599
after a while

174
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,400
the hamburg dpa sent multiple

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,120
questionnaires to clearview ai

176
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
in the beginning they didn't really

177
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,520
answer those requests but

178
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
after some time they were ordered under

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
a threat of penalties to finally answer

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
otherwise they would have paid up to 170

181
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
000 euros

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
so in the end clearly i replied and

183
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
after about one and a half year

184
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
clearview i deleted my biometric hash

185
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
value but

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
they didn't care about other hamburg

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
residents or other german residents

188
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
and they didn't tell what they would do

189
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
if they find new photos of my face in

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
the future

191
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
and till today

192
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,319
this complaint at a hamburg dpa is open

193
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
there's no final decision

194
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
people talk to to them again in august

195
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
and yes since this spiegel article here

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,520
appeared i'm support i'm supported by

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
neub none of your business which i'm

198
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
very happy about and

199
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,240
together we try to find a way to have

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200
here

201
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,958
a final decision

202
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,279
soon

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
so it might be interesting to know who

204
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,920
uses clearview ai in the

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
european union

206
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
leaked documents that were sadly leaked

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
only to a one news organization and not

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
to the public

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,760
show that law enforcement agency

210
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
agencies companies but also some rich

211
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,839
individuals were able to use the search

212
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,880
engine and

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,959
with the help of freedom of information

214
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,760
requests in lots of european countries

215
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
but also with the help of members of

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
parliaments in different countries we

217
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
learned that

218
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
most

219
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
countries do not know much about the use

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
of clearview ai by officials in those

221
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,880
countries so they often said there are

222
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
no life or historic contracts or they

223
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,839
are not aware of the use of clear

224
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,959
air is something the european commission

225
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,880
said as well in july 2020 and members of

226
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
the european parliament were not so

227
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
happy about this answer because at this

228
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
point in time there have been lots of

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
media reports of

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
also european

231
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
companies that have used clearview ai

232
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,720
and not just companies but also the

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
police in sweden for example use

234
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
clearview ai on a workshop that was

235
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
organized by europol

236
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
so yeah while hamburg had a good start i

237
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
would say

238
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
other countries developed faster than

239
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,600
cleveland in the meantime was deemed

240
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,440
illegal in australia canada the uk but

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
also

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
countries of the european union

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
including france greece and italy there

244
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
have been at least two fines up to 20

245
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
million

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
order

247
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
20 million euros and they have been

248
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
orders to delete the data of

249
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
residents

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
of the corresponding countries

251
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
a good question is how to enforce

252
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
those

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
but it's a good start to finally decide

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
that clear ai is illegal within the

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
european union

256
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,079
then

257
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,720
clearview ai is of course not the only

258
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
search engine there's

259
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
also pim eyes pim eyes might be more

260
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,560
dangerous than clearly ai because pim

261
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
ice is public

262
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
can be used by every one of you

263
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
and

264
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
it's basically

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
a difference a different search engine

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
but the same story because hamburg is

267
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
doing nothing again

268
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,640
and

269
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
pim eyes in the beginning was based in

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,200
poland but moved to the seychelles

271
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
to

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
be better able to ignore the gdpr and we

273
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
learned that dpa's data protection

274
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
authorities are too slow and gdpr does

275
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
not help against the clearview ais of

276
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
this world and

277
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,000
now apunk will continue telling you

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,959
about the initiation initiative we claim

279
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
your face

280
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
which

281
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
might

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
help to improve the situation in the

283
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,959
future

284
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,720
hello

285
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,279
hi hi hi hi yeah always wanted to

286
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
perform in a circus tent never knew that

287
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
it was about biometric surveillance

288
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
um so i'm talking about reclaim your

289
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,600
face an initiative that kind of turned

290
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
into a network over the last one and a

291
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,720
half years

292
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,519
um

293
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
done by edri the european digital rights

294
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,839
association

295
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,200
where

296
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
basically a rooftop organization for all

297
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,519
the

298
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,920
european digital rights

299
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
ngos

300
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah and it's about

301
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,800
biometric mass surveillance and

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
we basically demand that it is

303
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,639
completely banned

304
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,440
um we've heard about

305
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
photos now mainly photos but

306
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,519
of course biometric data is much more

307
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,160
it's your fingerprints it's your voice

308
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
pattern it's your typing pattern it's

309
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,600
the way you walk or the pattern of your

310
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,360
veins or whatever

311
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
and the problem is that

312
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
yeah you usually keep these

313
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
data for your whole life

314
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,240
so once it is in a in a database it uh

315
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
will stay there

316
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,279
um

317
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
yeah these these slides are from from aj

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
and

319
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,760
i'm

320
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
basically preaching to the choir here a

321
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
bit so i'll do it fast and

322
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
of course we have the problem of general

323
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
monitoring uh on i don't know parking

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
lots uh public transport

325
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
in in every corner of the city you have

326
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,639
the cameras

327
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
you can do predictive policing with it

328
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
we all know it doesn't work but uh

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
yep the the uh

330
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,399
research goes on to to work on that

331
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,199
uh

332
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,040
the problem is that it is

333
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
yeah captain databases i don't have to

334
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
tell you about that and

335
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
uh at the borders you can you can get

336
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,839
into problems if

337
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
they

338
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,959
in in real time compare your face to to

339
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
the uh

340
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
i don't know unwanted uh members of

341
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
community

342
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
and as uh cantor told us uh

343
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
there are a lot of pictures of us in the

344
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
internet you

345
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
basically can't

346
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
can't do anything against it in in in

347
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
this time

348
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
so uh reclaim your face is a

349
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,199
civil society initiative um

350
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,160
a european citizen initiative it's it's

351
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,279
uh

352
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,760
if we do collect like a million

353
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
signatures the european parliament has

354
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,519
to

355
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,480
hear

356
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
the complaints

357
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,199
um

358
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,880
there were demands and there was a new

359
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
law on um

360
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
the ai act the artificial intelligence

361
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
act

362
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,440
and um the first proposal came out this

363
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
april

364
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,079
and yes some of our demands were heard

365
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,319
so

366
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
yeah a real time

367
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
recognition is not allowed

368
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
and remote biometric

369
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,600
identification

370
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,079
should be prohibited

371
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,440
but of course there are

372
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
too many exceptions there is a very

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
vague wording as we unfortunately have

374
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
it often in european union laws

375
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
too many exceptions especially for the

376
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
law enforcement

377
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,320
and

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
just because real time recognition is

379
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
not allowed doesn't mean that they can

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,519
take all the material and scrape it

381
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,279
afterwards like they did in hamburg on

382
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
the g20 summit

383
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
they they collected terabytes of

384
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
material and went through it afterwards

385
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
uh it's still pending if that was legal

386
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,079
or not

387
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
so uh

388
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
basically if you are interested in in

389
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,639
in these problems uh pierre please join

390
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
the network

391
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
uh act on a local

392
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
local level

393
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
and uh

394
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
sign the initiative it's still going to

395
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
the end of the month

396
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
reclaim your face

397
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
and

398
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,519
it helps

399
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,720
to

400
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
have a strong voice if you have a lot of

401
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,759
signatures

402
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
and yes we have stickers thank you very

403
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
much i'm giving the microphone two

404
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
latter

405
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,000
um well hello everyone um since we're in

406
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
the netherlands i'm gonna tell you a

407
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,000
little bit about the dutch situation

408
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
regarding facial recognition

409
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,559
and especially on clear view ai

410
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,000
i myself also did a data subject access

411
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
request at clearview ai

412
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,839
and also my face is in this

413
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,480
database

414
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,280
i had contact with the dutch dpa also

415
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
about filing complaint

416
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
because we see now in a lot of countries

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
in europe that this is quite successful

418
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,039
and that the dpas are critical

419
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
but the dutch dpa had a kind of

420
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
different perspective

421
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,640
because they told us you should not file

422
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,760
a complaint directly to clearview ai but

423
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,559
you should file a complaint against a

424
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
client or a customer of clearview ai

425
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
and we thought this was kind of weird

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,960
because as contorcol just also argued

427
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
the gdpr is applicable to clear qai

428
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
directly and it's quite hard to find out

429
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,799
who these customers exactly are so

430
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,360
we work together with a dutch journalist

431
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
to get some insight in what kind of

432
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,280
governmental organizations we're making

433
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
use of clearview

434
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,919
so we did foia request we asked the

435
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,679
round

436
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,679
but nothing except the numbers that some

437
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
of you might known that are published by

438
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
buzzfeed and that told us it's the dutch

439
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
police

440
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
so we even asked directly the dutch

441
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,520
police to explain these numbers

442
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
but there we just got fake answers also

443
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,919
from the minister

444
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,640
kind of obfuscating this whole situation

445
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
by saying something like

446
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,799
we're not using this as an organization

447
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200
leaving all the space for individual

448
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
cops to use clear view ai

449
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,520
so

450
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
now this shows us

451
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
several things it makes it very hard for

452
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,679
us to file a complaint at the dutch dpa

453
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,120
since they have this different

454
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,880
perspective it also shows that

455
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
we have one gdpr that should be

456
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
applicable equally and that's not the

457
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
case

458
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
so this is a bit weird

459
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
um and it's also why we would like to

460
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
have a talk

461
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,919
with you in a more interactive way also

462
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,679
because we're here together with a lot

463
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,240
of people from different countries

464
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
people who might have tried different

465
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
strategies who might have to deal with

466
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,200
different dpas who are in different

467
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
situations

468
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
so that would be very nice

469
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,320
um

470
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
this is some things that

471
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
you could do if you're worried about

472
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
facial recognition use

473
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
or other biometric surveillance for that

474
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
matter in your country

475
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
it's also meant as a kind of suggestion

476
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
or inspiration so

477
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
epung told you all about the reclaim

478
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
your face petition you can sign that it

479
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
does help

480
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
you can also file your own access

481
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
request see whether you're in the

482
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
database it's also a good starting point

483
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
for a complaint at your national dpa

484
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,600
and there's also other ways to put

485
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,039
pressure

486
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,039
especially if you're dutch

487
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
i would really like people to do this

488
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
because all the fines in the other

489
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,159
european countries really show that the

490
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
dutch dpa has a perspective that's not

491
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
common and they choose to have this

492
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,720
perspective so i think it really helps

493
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,360
if people put pressure on the dutch dpa

494
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
to say hey look at these other countries

495
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,159
there are the dpas are protecting the

496
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
citizens why are you not doing anything

497
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,960
we want you to do something and stop

498
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
this

499
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
well we would like to organize the

500
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
struggle a bit so you can see this talk

501
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,640
as

502
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
consisting out of two parts this is the

503
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
end of part one where we talk to you and

504
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
we would really like to have a part two

505
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,760
where you talk to us we will also talk

506
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
back

507
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,799
to have a bit more of an interactive

508
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,159
session

509
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,840
where we can share ideas share

510
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
experiences learn from each other get

511
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,760
organized

512
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
and see if we together can stop the use

513
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
of

514
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,679
biometric mass surveillance

515
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,919
thank you

516
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,520
can i final remark this meeting will be

517
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
at the sea base

518
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
and we still have a few minutes for q a

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
if you don't mind so if everyone has a

520
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,760
question please walk up to the

521
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,159
microphone um as there are no questions

522
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
from the internet let's start at the

523
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
back microphone please step closely to

524
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,880
the microphone yeah hi uh great great

525
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
talk first of all and great to hear

526
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,520
myself but for the first speaker so what

527
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
does it mean when they remove your hash

528
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,880
value because if they explicitly tell in

529
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
their database this is that has value

530
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,679
they still have data on you so i'm

531
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
curious if you can explain a bit more

532
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,919
about how that works because they can

533
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
re-get your original image

534
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,559
and start all over again so you have to

535
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,320
send in a request every year to get

536
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
removed or

537
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
what's your experience in that or you're

538
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,679
more experienced about this topic so

539
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
well that is a very good question

540
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
because that is exactly the point why we

541
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,200
are not happy with the state of this

542
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,679
complaint

543
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,640
okay

544
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
that's it

545
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
and then a second question for the last

546
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
speaker about the dutch situation so

547
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,400
uh what was their response when you

548
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,679
refer to italy and the other countries

549
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
uh

550
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
billing or even uh fining countries that

551
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
were part of the eu

552
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,120
and

553
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
so they should commit to the same uh

554
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,200
regulations it's the same law for the

555
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
whole european union as far as i know

556
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,679
um yeah you would you would say that

557
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,640
so it's also not really clear to us why

558
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
they take these stunts specifically

559
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,799
we had conversations with them about

560
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,799
maybe filing a complaint

561
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,440
and they just gave us their perspective

562
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
and said like yeah you can come to us

563
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,840
but then file a complaint on the users

564
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
and these were the reasons

565
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,679
and after

566
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,039
other dpas gave the fines we asked them

567
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,679
and they said yeah yeah

568
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,400
yeah yeah that's also possible

569
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
or so it's

570
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,279
it's really fake but still um

571
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
it doesn't look like they really changed

572
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
their mind

573
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
it looks like they don't have the

574
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
hacker's mentality that's for sure yeah

575
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
thank you maybe you can help us in

576
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,039
giving them that mentality

577
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
do you have another question

578
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
please come up to the microphone yes

579
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,200
thank you

580
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
i was wondering if there was maybe a

581
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
chance to turn their

582
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,080
system against them using something in

583
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,200
an adversarial manner stuff like this

584
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
person does not exist and generating a

585
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,559
lot of

586
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,520
faces in a way that would match sort of

587
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,480
your

588
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
hash value whatever this means or is it

589
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
to date something that's too easy to

590
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,360
counter

591
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,840
is there any sort of potential in there

592
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,320
well there might be some potential but

593
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
you would help help only very few people

594
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
that do that so it's not a final

595
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,080
solution so maybe you could help

596
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
protecting yourself a little better by

597
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
doing that but

598
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
i don't think that

599
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,240
that is something you could do on scale

600
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,880
okay thank you

601
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,880
thanks for the talk um

602
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
some things are quite ironic i mean you

603
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,200
have to stand there with your faces

604
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
someone's taking pictures there's video

605
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
everywhere

606
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,240
if you uh do this request you have to

607
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,919
send your face if

608
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,440
you want to fill in the petition you

609
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,600
have to enter your data it seems like

610
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
the whole system is set up

611
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,640
to

612
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
block us from doing stuff yeah it's not

613
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
really a question but first thanks for

614
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,120
being here and actually showing your

615
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
face and uh doing this but yeah any

616
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,080
general thoughts maybe you have here or

617
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
something we can do and change this

618
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,200
whole

619
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
whole thing yeah that that is a very

620
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
good comment because

621
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,919
i'm here for a specific reason i'm here

622
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
to tell you about clearviewi and i'm not

623
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
here to share my biometric data so

624
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
in the future i still want to be able to

625
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,120
attend a protest without the fear that

626
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,919
every policeman could be able to

627
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
identify me by simply taking a picture

628
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,039
because that might hinder me or you

629
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,600
attending a protest so

630
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
yeah i think it's necessary to show the

631
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,880
face but you have to think about

632
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
the reason why people are sharing the

633
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,120
pictures online or here

634
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
yeah the bigger picture thank you

635
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
and one last question from the

636
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
microphone at the back yes

637
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
i've heard that a lot of people are

638
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,240
using artistic

639
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
measures to

640
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,440
seclude their official

641
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
you know uh

642
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,600
what is called

643
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,400
the

644
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,640
you know the the form of the face so

645
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
i've heard that it

646
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,840
doesn't work that well

647
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
for me punk

648
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
are there you mean that people for

649
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
example mask up to

650
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
to kind of steer the ai the wrong

651
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
direction yeah with dots and lines

652
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,480
yeah

653
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
what happens kind of is that in the

654
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
beginning it works because you're

655
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
covering data points so you make it

656
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
harder for the technology to detect your

657
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
face

658
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,720
but then um for example during kofit i

659
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
think it happened a lot of people uh had

660
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
the mask on a lot so also a lot of

661
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,159
pictures were made of people with the

662
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,200
mask on so they created a database with

663
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
faces that were masked to train the ai

664
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
so now they're better capable to

665
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,200
recognize faces that are masked and i

666
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
think this dynamics you also get with

667
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
with other things like you could now

668
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,919
think of something else to cover a

669
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,240
different part of your face or

670
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
uh make it harder for

671
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
in another way

672
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
and it will help temporarily and then

673
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,799
probably the ai is trained to

674
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
well make it possible again

675
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
sorry this is very pessimistic but yeah

676
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
that's awful thank you for

677
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,960
the answer and for the talk

678
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
i do i do have to cut you short i'm very

679
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
sorry we are out of time um if you want

680
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,679
to talk to these wonderful people come

681
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,760
by at the sea base which is currently on

682
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,600
12 volts i think correct yep

683
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,120
yep pointy black

684
