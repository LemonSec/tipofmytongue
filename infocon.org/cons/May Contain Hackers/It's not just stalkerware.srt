how your products can be used or

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
abused um what about the dual use tools

like they can be used for

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
findings stuff like your phone or your

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
bag but they can also be used for

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,960
tracking people i'm here with me on

has any one of you ever been stuck by an

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,880
air tag

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,159
yes yes a couple

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
and who of you have been stopped by an

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,079
air tech

38
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
by me

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,479
yes

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
if you were not in this last group i'm

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,880
really sorry that really sucks

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
and feel free to come talk to me uh

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
after this presentation

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
um but i am chantal steikenberg and

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,878
sometimes i stalk people with air tags

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,599
for science

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,040
apple released the air tag in april of

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
2021

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
this is an air tech you probably can see

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
it but there's a good picture here

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
and very quickly after that there were a

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
lot of concerns

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
and even reports with stalking of

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
stalking with air attacks

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
it seems they didn't really think about

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
how an air attack could be used for

57
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
stalking

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
but we're now a year later and they have

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
released multiple security

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,640
improvements for the air tech

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
iphone users they get a notification if

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
they're being followed by an air tech

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,160
that is not yours

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,280
and

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
the thing should

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,720
also beep

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
when it's not in the vicinity of its

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
owner

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
but android users have to install a

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
separate app to scan for air tags

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,319
and all still the same thing with with

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
the beeping it will also happen after

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
some time it's away from the owner's

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,840
phone

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
but i was kind of curious and i wanted

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,920
to know if i could actually stalk

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
people with an air attack so i set all

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,440
my male colleagues down and some friends

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,360
and i asked them if i could actually

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
stalk them

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,239
and a lot of them said yes

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
so uh i wanted to see like if they get a

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,159
notification and um if it would start

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
beeping and uh i also wanted to know if

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
you could hear the beeping

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
and turns out that if you have an iphone

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
the notification that you are being

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
followed by an airtag it works it

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,439
shows up within the hour

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
yeah already a little bit of time to

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
follow you but

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
reasonable

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
but without an iphone

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
how would they know

95
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
because who is going to use this very

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,238
specific app to scan for airtechs

97
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
multiple times a day to see if you're

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
being followed

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
i don't think a lot of people do that

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
and

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
not once in my experiments did it

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
actually start beeping

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
but if it would it would be very easy to

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
disable that beforehand

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
and you can even buy them with the sound

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
disabled

107
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
it's big business because it's this is

108
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
way more money than

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
the original air attack

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
so apple

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
made a very affordable tracker or

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
stalking device

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
but they are not the only one

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
um there's

115
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
the samsung smart tag the air tag and

116
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
you have tile

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
this is a smart tag

118
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,560
and many many more

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
but actually that is a very small

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
portion of what you or i

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
as a potential stalking victim would

122
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
have to worry about

123
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,360
um

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
last week on twitter i asked

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
my followers what do you think that

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
stalkerware is

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
and it kind of seems that we have a

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
pretty good idea of what that is

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
so software used to track what someone

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,160
does with the device or what the

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,479
location is without them knowing of

132
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
course

133
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
or

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
all heart and software that collects

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
data to track you online

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
and or in real life without your consent

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
spyware installed with the intention of

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,919
one individual to gather data such as

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,360
location

140
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
uh of another covertly

141
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
um

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
and yeah

143
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,120
that all

144
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
is stalk aware

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
from september 2020 to may 2021 the

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
number of devices infected with stock

147
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
aware

148
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,600
increased by 63

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,199
and this is according to a study by

150
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
norton labs

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,319
and they actually saw an upward trend in

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
stockholm as people went into lockdown

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
many people were first forced to spend

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,199
more time at home and

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
this likely created more opportunities

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
for perpetrators

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
to actually install

158
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
stalker wear on their partner's device

159
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
and as lockdown subsided

160
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
it seems as though stockwear

161
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
installation have ceased to increase

162
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,360
but it's still

163
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
at very high levels

164
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
fortunately there is are also some great

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
initiatives to help and fight stalk

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,199
aware

167
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
the coalition against soccerware

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
actually um got a lot of the the biggest

169
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,319
antivirus companies to detect

170
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,759
stalkerware and alert users

171
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
almost anyone can become a victim of

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
stalking

173
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
and stalkers do not just target

174
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
celebrities

175
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
sometimes

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,000
they are ex-partners

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
and they know they are known to the

178
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,720
victim but it could also be a an

179
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
acquaintance or just a simple stranger

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
and with stock aware

181
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
the perpetrator

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
needs access to the device

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,759
or

184
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
they need to persuade the victim to

185
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,720
install something on the device

186
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
and in cases where the stalker is an

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
ex-partner or current partner that is

188
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
doable but in other cases it is way

189
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,919
easier to gain access

190
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
to the accounts of the victim

191
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,039
gather information about the victim on

192
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
social media or

193
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,639
use those tracking devices

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,759
tech companies they develop new apps and

195
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
gadgets seemingly without thinking about

196
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,720
other ways they can be used and the air

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,879
tech was a very good example of that

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
so you might be wondering why

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,800
and how i got interested in this topic

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
um

201
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,000
it's a little bit of a journey six years

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
ago i started working

203
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
at zerocopter in marketing

204
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
but i was so fascinated by all the

205
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
vulnerabilities our researchers were

206
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
finding that i needed to know

207
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
how that all worked

208
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,839
and i started

209
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
learning how to hack

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
and today i am head of researchers at

211
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,480
sierra culpr and i got to meet so many

212
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
great people in security

213
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,519
and one of them was valentin maret

214
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,040
we were

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,839
visitors at a conference and we noticed

216
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,640
that we were amongst the very few women

217
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
there

218
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
so in 2019 we founded wicca

219
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,640
women in cyber security community

220
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
association

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
and next to the awesome meetups we

222
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
organized with wicca we have one tonight

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
even

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
so if you want to join

225
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,640
please come

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
and and there was also something that

227
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
happened that we did not think of

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
bef when we started wika and victims of

229
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
stalking

230
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
they trusted us enough to ask us for

231
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
help

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,040
most of them were women

233
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
and they wanted to be helped by women

234
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
and they didn't know where to go

235
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,200
there is so little out there to get help

236
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
they needed help

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
they needed help with gathering evidence

238
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,839
to go to the police

239
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
needed help

240
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,600
with making sure the stalker no longer

241
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,560
had access to their device the phone or

242
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
the laptop

243
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
and they also often

244
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,160
want reassurance so they need help with

245
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,720
checking if someone no longer has access

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
if that's actually

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
all done and they want yeah they want to

248
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,760
reassurance

249
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,320
and we started doing that and we still

250
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
do

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
and this was also one of the reasons why

252
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
i became a volunteer for the dutch

253
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
police

254
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,399
um

255
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,160
and i started working on stalker cases

256
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
for the dutch police as well and

257
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,839
especially if it involves something

258
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,360
digital

259
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,839
but in all of those cases in the past

260
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,440
few years

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
i personally never encountered

262
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
a case

263
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
involving an air tag or samsung galaxy

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
tag or tau

265
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,880
not yet

266
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
it's very hot topic in the media it's

267
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
very cool to write articles about it but

268
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
this is not what happens in most cases

269
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
it usually goes a little something like

270
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,839
this this is a very

271
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
anonymized generic story but

272
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
emily

273
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,839
that's our victim she gets an email from

274
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,320
a social media platform that there was a

275
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,600
login from a different location

276
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
but yeah she gets those email emails

277
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
more often and

278
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
she just

279
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
dismisses it but a day later she opened

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
the app and

281
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,800
she had to log in again and she thought

282
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
a little bit strange but oh well

283
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,200
later that week she gets a

284
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
text message from her ex

285
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
and he is asking if she had fun in

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
amsterdam

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
but she was thinking

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
how does he know

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,880
did i post something about this

290
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,440
i can't remember that

291
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
i only talked about this

292
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
to my friend in a dm

293
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,800
this is weird

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,760
so she asked her ex how he knows but

295
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
yeah he's not giving straight answers

296
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,839
he's being vague about it so um yeah

297
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,880
that she thought maybe that that email

298
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,959
was something i should change my

299
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,399
password

300
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
but she already has a really uneasy

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,399
feeling and um yeah she changes her

302
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
password but she's not sure about it

303
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,440
a month later her ex is at her apartment

304
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,000
because they recently broke up and he

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
still had she still had some stuff from

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
him so he needed to pick it up

307
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
but that's not the only thing he did he

308
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
was also fighting with her

309
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
he's not happy with the breakup he wants

310
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,639
her back

311
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
he is angry at her and she has to work

312
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
really hard to get him to leave

313
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
but he's also very upset that she

314
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
apparently moved on with her life and

315
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,399
he's like giving all kinds of examples

316
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,600
but

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
after his last message the message from

318
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
last month she barely posted anything on

319
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
social media because she already had an

320
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,680
uneasy feeling

321
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
so why does he think that

322
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
she has moved on and how does he know

323
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
all this stuff

324
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,839
in the days after

325
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
uh this more and more starts happening

326
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
on a different social media platform she

327
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
can't seem to find some of the messages

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
that were sent to her

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
and she also unfollowed some people all

330
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
of the sudden

331
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
she gets many of these emails from

332
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,959
various services that the logging was

333
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
from an unknown location

334
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,279
and yeah she keeps changing the

335
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
passwords but it doesn't really stop

336
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
then one day she gets a message from a

337
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
friend

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
hey is this you

339
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
and there's a screenshot of a dating

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,639
site profile

341
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
and she replies no where did you find

342
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
this

343
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,199
and then he

344
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
decides to explain this to her on a

345
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
phone call

346
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
he explains where he found the dating

347
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,639
dating site profile um but the text in

348
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,040
the bio is a little bit strange so

349
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
that's why he decided to contact her

350
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
he goes on to tell emily that the

351
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
profile is asking for explicit sex

352
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
and that if someone messages the profile

353
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
they can get some nudes uh and an

354
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,399
address

355
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
and this is uh where i'm going to stop

356
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
because i think we can all imagine that

357
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
this is a very frightening situation

358
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
and it leaves you with a lot of

359
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
questions

360
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,639
but where do you start with finding help

361
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
if you don't know what's going on

362
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
and i'm sure many of you

363
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,240
already have a checklist in your head of

364
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
things to check

365
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
things to do

366
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
things to turn on

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
but most people don't understand what is

368
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
going on and they don't have this

369
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
checklist

370
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
so for many victims this feels very

371
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
lonely and they feel a lot of shame

372
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
they are constantly afraid of what is

373
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
going to happen next

374
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
and they then they also have to go on

375
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
this big

376
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
search to get help

377
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,599
because what yeah what do you google

378
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
some of them they end up with the police

379
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,639
but the police are

380
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
dependent on the evidence that they can

381
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
get

382
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,839
and to get evidence

383
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,399
that someone has access to your accounts

384
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,120
is not always easy

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
victims they change their passwords to

386
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
try and fix it they reinstall their

387
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
phones or laptops they even buy new

388
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
phones and laptops to

389
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
make sure that no one can get in

390
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
so not all evidence can be gathered

391
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
anymore

392
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
and this makes that these cases are

393
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
pretty hard

394
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,399
and

395
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
what i have experienced in all of those

396
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
cases is that um the victims really

397
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,600
don't

398
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,519
don't know where to turn to

399
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,399
and

400
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,720
yeah this is where i think

401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,519
i

402
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
and us

403
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,880
you we can all help

404
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,600
stalking victims are upset they are

405
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
frightened and they really don't feel

406
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
safe

407
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,399
but can we help them feel safe and stay

408
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,399
safe

409
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
i know that in this tent we probably all

410
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,040
understand uh strong unique passwords

411
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
and multi-factor authentication

412
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,160
and that would have prevented a lot for

413
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
emily

414
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
so

415
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
if you have something

416
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
someone you know

417
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
that doesn't understand this as well as

418
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,160
you do

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
please help them

420
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
help them understand what

421
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
they can

422
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,599
prevent

423
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,799
by setting this all up

424
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,559
that's it thank you

425
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,919
thank you very much um

426
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,160
we do have time for question and answers

427
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
if you're up to it yeah okay great uh

428
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
unfortunately no questions from the

429
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
internet so anyone in the audience any

430
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
questions comments you come up to the

431
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,360
microphone please in the middle there

432
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
are two microphones in the middle

433
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,480
walk up to them

434
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
and i will call you yes just walk

435
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
towards and close to the mic yes exactly

436
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
like that yeah okay

437
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
so just a question i well first of all

438
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
super interesting thanks uh thanks for

439
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
your presentation

440
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
the case was very interesting on seeing

441
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
what happens but i'm a bit curious if

442
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,000
there's anything you can share of after

443
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,440
that happens like for example in this

444
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
case emily we know yeah all the

445
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
compromise and whatever uh did you just

446
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,600
go and do the research in that try to

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,039
get back to the person eventually the

448
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
police or do you actually just go and

449
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
try to fix it patch it i don't know what

450
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
yeah in most cases we uh we either try

451
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,400
to they come after they've been to the

452
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
police they come to us to they want to

453
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,760
make sure that no one is in there

454
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
anymore so and then we help them go

455
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,039
through every checklist and and set

456
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,360
everything up so yeah with multi-factor

457
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,919
authentication strong unique passwords

458
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,039
um

459
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
but in some cases they have also been to

460
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
the police and they say there's not

461
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
enough evidence

462
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
and in that case we do try to help

463
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
gather that evidence

464
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,480
and that is a long process uh sometimes

465
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
it can take up two months

466
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
uh or even years um uh and but we try to

467
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
gather evidence to document everything

468
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
that is happening make screenshots uh

469
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
yeah

470
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
try to gather everything so that yeah

471
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
they have a little bit more evidence and

472
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
then maybe the police can

473
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,880
go after someone sometimes it's also

474
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
not known who the perpetrator is and in

475
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
that case it's it's very difficult but

476
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,520
in most cases the victim already has a

477
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,559
hunch

478
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,760
they already

479
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
know of someone that might do this and

480
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
in my experience it's usually that

481
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
person yeah

482
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
thank you

483
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,760
next question please yep

484
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,840
not per se a question more like a

485
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,760
comment like during the telling of the

486
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,440
story of emily i felt like i just wanted

487
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
to punch that guy in the face

488
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
yeah me too yeah

489
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
it's just

490
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,679
so up that this kind of stuff

491
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,799
happens

492
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,640
yeah and that is really something i

493
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
learned in the past couple of years is

494
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,240
that this has such an

495
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
emotional

496
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,520
impact on victims um that

497
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,799
sometimes they get so paranoid that

498
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,760
yeah they they can't even uh

499
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,200
leave their house

500
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
uh so yeah it's a lot of impacts yeah

501
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
yeah this is just this

502
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,559
way too much there must be ways this

503
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,559
should be regulated and like

504
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
there should be some kind of education

505
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,559
so

506
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,799
people who

507
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
so people can go to their phones and

508
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
check for like malicious shapes or like

509
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
and yeah

510
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,559
that's like a lot of anti-virus

511
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,640
companies now have this detection in

512
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
their in their antivirus so if you

513
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
install this on your phone they actually

514
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,280
scan for stall career and they alert you

515
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,919

516
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
but it sounds like you want to help yeah

517
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,360
i definitely want to help let's do it

518
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,360

519
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
uh cheers uh thanks for the talk um just

520
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
wondering if anyone say for someone came

521
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,320
to me and said hey i think i might be a

522
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
victim of stalker where um do you have

523
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
any advice on where that person should

524
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,679
go

525
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
you mentioned obviously wicker and stuff

526
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,039
like that and you seem to be helping

527
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,159
people already

528
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
is there resources that i can push them

529
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
towards like here here's a checklist if

530
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
you're feeling uncomfortable talking to

531
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,600
people or these people you can go to

532
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
are there any kind of like

533
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
you know you mentioned the police

534
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
already do they have a way you talk to

535
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
them or yeah that's a little bit uh of

536
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,480
the problem i think so for

537
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
stock aware software that's actually

538
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
installed on your phone or your laptop

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,720
or anything there is some like detection

540
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,480
for that so

541
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,280
uh but then yeah the case in the case of

542
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
that someone is in your account so for

543
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
example uh facebook icloud i don't know

544
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,960
um

545
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
that's something completely different

546
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
and then you have the air attacks you

547
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,440
have

548
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,280
plenty more variations there's not one

549
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
single point you can go to

550
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,240
except for the police and then um yeah

551
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,039
they need evidence so that's uh that's

552
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,039
that's difficult so that's why i'm

553
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
indeed i'm asking for help because i

554
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
don't have all the sources also

555
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,679
but i think we can improve a lot

556
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,720
in that

557
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
um

558
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
and we can help victims

559
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,039
point to point them in the right

560
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,799
direction

561
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
cheers

562
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
do you have any

563
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
objectives or warning signs for people

564
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
to like look out for for other people

565
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
yeah so for me would be account sharing

566
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
and like oh yeah he knows my password

567
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,320
that's

568
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,159
i admit that i don't also have an entire

569
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
database that i i already publicly

570
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
shared i do have some stuff

571
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
and i'm going to share that uh but

572
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,280
usually it it's like all different kinds

573
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
of lists that

574
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
i send to people

575
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,280
um

576
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,240
but it's also like these people are not

577
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,799
as tech savvy as we are

578
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,640
so it helps if you walk them through it

579
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
more what i mean is like for the

580
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
technical person for friends to

581
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,799
look out for oh yeah they would be like

582
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,760
hey

583
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
i have a friend and she shares her

584
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
account email accounts with her

585
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
boyfriend yeah i would recommend not

586
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
doing that coming up

587
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,400

uh there's great talk um

594
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,559
the coalition against stalkerware

595
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,720
is that something one can get involved

596
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
with from different countries and stuff

597
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,559
like that i think so uh i i where would

598
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,559
you go

599
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,559
should we build our own

600
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,640
no yeah no no i think the coalition

601
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
against soccer is very

602
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
so they got enter virus companies to

603
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
work together and to detect software so

604
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,679
that that is one thing they've done but

605
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,440
they've done a lot more stuff um uh and

606
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
this is international so uh yeah

607
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,480
definitely yeah and also yesterday by

608
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760

614
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
working backwards

615

the anti-stalker function

620
