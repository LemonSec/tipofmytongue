[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
let's start with some questions

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
you can ask for yourself

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
and one of the questions is how is your

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
mobile tracked by wi-fi

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
why does the municipality of enschede

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,679
wants to know

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
who you are and where you are and stuff

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
like that

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
is anonymous data is is that a real

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,200
thing or that is that only in story

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,079
and

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,879
what you can do to get more better

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,039
privacy for yourself so in the end i

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
give some do-it-yourself instructions

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,800
uh if you want if you are inspired by me

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,680
so

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,640
um

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
a little bit about myself

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,120
um so i started as an uh biscuit like

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,920
many of us with the commodore 64.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
and in that time you get

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
real books with it how to use it so not

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
only a warranty claim but

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,040
you could really

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
learn how to program the converter 64.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
so i broken it in with basic

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,880
and that's kind of was for my

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,759
introduction with computers

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,560
i also saw the rise of the internet yes

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,759
i'm that old

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,200
um

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
and um yeah

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,840
and it was becoming very clear that

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
privacy is going to be an issue

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
somewhere

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,360
and i was a big fan of php

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,119
and that's for encryption but this is

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
another story

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
um so i was always interested in

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,960
technology and how it works and yeah

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,159
get to know what it is and what the

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
challenge might be

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
in 2011 i started my own hacker space in

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,079
enschede called stuccolab

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,080
and at the club self i also give

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
workshops and lectures

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
also about 3d printed laser cutter

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
but also i gave an

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
um kind of discussion group for about a

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,360
slip pad

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,560
it's already a few years ago but also

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
about the coroner melder

54
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
that was kind of techno the technique

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
they used was good and some people say

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,319
yeah it is on mobile so it just can be

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,120
good so i try to explain why it's good

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
and what they do to protect your privacy

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
and stuff like that so

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,599
that's a little bit about my backgrounds

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
for this story we have three parties

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,040
involved

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
you have the outright tight person's

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,239
heavens

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
as we say in good dutch

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
that is the dpa for the netherlands so

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
if you have any complaints about privacy

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,599
issues

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
you can ask them to look into it and

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,280
then

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
they should do a little bit research and

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
then

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,430
come to conclusion

74
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,319
[Music]

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
another part is the

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,519
rmc

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,720
and i can say is kind of

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
consulting firm for retailing

79
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,360
but they don't

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
do only

81
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
consultancy but they also

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,879
keep track of statistics so and city

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,280
know how many fishes they have

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
but maybe how to improve the city itself

85
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
and yeah that kind of advice

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
and of course the municipal itself that

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
got defined so

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
um to understand what is happening i

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
first have to explain a little bit uh

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,440
about

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
yeah he has all technical people so it's

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,518
more for the people at home of course

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
so enhance is an um

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
one-way function so if you're an

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,120
original meant for files

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,159
um and you get an uh hash from a file

97
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,120
it's kind of fingerprint

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
and if you only change one bit in the

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
original file and you do the same hash

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
again you get a totally different

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
fingerprint print so that

102
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
that way you can check if the print

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,960
defense print

104
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
fingerprint

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,919
match between files and if the

106
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
fingerprint dash match you can assume

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
that's physical the same file so this

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
kind of technology that is behind it

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
you can see how an hash kind of looks so

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
this is in shot

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
265 hash and you have all kind of

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,390
different hashes

113
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,000
[Music]

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so it is one way so if you have the

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
fingerprint or you have the hash you

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
cannot recalculate it back to the

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
original string

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
so this yeah you can only do one kind of

119
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
calculation

120
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
um

121
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
yeah and

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
if you do the

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,600
calculation again and again again uh

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,840
it'll always give the same hash so

125
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
um

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
and they use the hash for the city

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,880
traffic method and that's the way

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,479
the company explains how they use it

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,919
and

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
if you walk around in the city

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
and even if you're not logged into a

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,240
network

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
uh the the mobile is gonna shout around

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,759
uh hey home network are you there

135
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,639
uh

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
and if you have an uh sensor and you uh

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,919
do a little bit tweaking on the sensor

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
the sensor can hear that

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
and that is the basic of this whole

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
technology

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,639
and that way you can see the mac address

142
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,680
of the

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
wi-fi chip inside your mobile

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
so the mac address is kind of serial

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
number to you mobile

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
um

147
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
and the city traffic method

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
means that they make a hash from the mac

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
address and they only use the first 12

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
characters

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
they do that on the sensor

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,039
and then send to the hash

153
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,240
together with the sensor id date and

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
time

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,759
to the temporary database

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,840
and

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
they um and that that is done the

158
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,639
pseudo anonymous code so they say yeah

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,199
we have to it's not totally there

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
and in the next step uh they uh

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,440
put it

162
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
in

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
the the database for the statistics

164
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
uh and they remove the last three

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,080
characters and that is called uh it's

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,919
anonymous so

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,400
they say yeah we've now short a hash

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
form from mac address

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
and that is privacy proof

170
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
and they don't explain why it is price

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
proof so yeah

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
i have some questions there

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
they uh always use the same hash so if

174
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
you want to do hash

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,800
itself

176
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
doesn't say anything if it's safe or not

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,199
um

178
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
but yeah what traffic could do is uh

179
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,479
using a salt or seed every day

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
and put it together with the input

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
strain so we get every time another hash

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,400
total

183
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
so

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,039
but they didn't choose for that so

185
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
since they started with the wi-fi

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
tracking

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
they always should use the same method

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
and not only for enscg but also in all

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,080
the other cities that they are active in

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
and that means if you walk around an

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
entree

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
they can see what

193
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
make you have then it's going to be

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
translated to dash

195
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
but they can see the same hash if you

196
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
walk around in henlo

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
or one of the other cities that city

198
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,879
traffic is active in

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
and they started data for six months in

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
total

201
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
so

202
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,160
um

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
yeah and uh

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
and i think

205
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,039
what's going to be a big point in the

206
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,160
end

207
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
if um there is a relation between the

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,199
mec and the person itself

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
and um

210
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,120
then the municipality and uh rmc says

211
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
there's no

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
real one-to-one relationship between

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
those two

214
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
um

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
yeah i'm not not i don't agree to that

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
because if you know the original hash

217
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,919
and you know how to calculate sorry if

218
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,399
you know the original mac address

219
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,719
and you know how to calculate the hash

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
you can do the calculation again

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
so yeah it's still one way

222
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
but that way

223
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
you can check

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
hey is this mac address but not to this

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
hash

226
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
so that that's uh

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
yeah the kind of black and white uh

228
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
discussion about that

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
another important

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,880
point is uh yeah the mecha dress itself

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
doesn't mean anything

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
but it's kind of unique

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
and they jump around numbers and stuff

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
like that

235
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
and they say hey we have now something

236
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
that's

237
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
anomalized but it's still unique for a

238
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,560
person

239
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
so yeah

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
i think i think that is not a good way

241
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
to do that

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
and we can see that because the ap did

243
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
some research about the database

244
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
and i don't know if you can see it with

245
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
this very small

246
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,640
colors

247
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
stripes on the

248
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,719
slide and this is

249
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,880
a few weeks you don't see me my mouse

250
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,279
[Music]

251
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
so that's a few weeks and every night at

252
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,399
uh

253
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
between four and five

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
a.m

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
is uh there's people some person is

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
walking around uh

257
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
buying sensor

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
and you can see that it's kind of steady

259
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
and he's those that are only

260
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,399
from tuesday till saturday

261
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,880
so that's kind of the naughty wall night

262
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,000
night lee walker if you call him peter

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,959
um

264
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,680
so yeah the fact you can do something

265
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
like that uh means that it's not uh

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
normalized

267
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
and still they say yeah but we don't

268
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,160
can't point to one person yeah i don't

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
agree to that

270
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
because in this case if you uh if you

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
know where the sensor is and you're

272
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
gonna

273
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
yeah had gonna stay there for the one

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
night on the right moment

275
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
probably it's only one person that's

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
gonna buy so

277
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
and that is not so hard

278
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
all right this is assuming

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
yeah

280
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
in another story

281
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
the other person they found in the

282
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,120
database is

283
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
probably in a resident

284
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,240
so rmc says yeah we filter out persons

285
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
that are

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,959
resident there

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
and they do that if a person is there

288
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
between five and seven and

289
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
in the evening between uh 10 and 11

290
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
and if the person is there on both times

291
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
then they assume

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
that the person is in resident and is

293
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
not included in the database

294
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
so what you see here is

295
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
all the days there's no uh

296
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,399
marks

297
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
that's probably the days that was

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
successful

299
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
and other days

300
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
uh maybe that the phone was off

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
or maybe he was late at home uh

302
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
late

303
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,279
at home so it was not there between

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,000
10 and 11. so that is included here

305
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,000
so that is not good also

306
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,079
so

307
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
i i didn't do i i didn't have any data

308
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
so

309
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,839
don't

310
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,639
worry

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
and i did i counted the days here um

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,720
and it's around uh it looks like it's

313
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
working only for 50 for the cases

314
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,519
uh and it should be

315
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,320
yeah 100 or something like that so yeah

316
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,800
um

317
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
so what we can

318
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,440
what is kind of the conclusion about the

319
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
city traffic method

320
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
uh yeah that removing the three

321
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,160
positions often the 12 position hash is

322
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,360
not sufficient to have an enormity

323
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
because we saw just a few persons and we

324
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,839
can't kind of identify them

325
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,079
already okay

326
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
so

327
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,480
yeah

328
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
juggling around with hashes and stuff

329
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,639
that doesn't work

330
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
um

331
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,120
yeah i have to

332
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
hurry up a little bit

333
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
um

334
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,720
so uh to to uh make something uh uh no

335
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
names uh it's very hard to do that right

336
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,839
and also uh

337
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,160
many uh data sets

338
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
are published and they say yeah it is

339
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,440
fully uh anonymous and researchers do

340
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
their music and hey we see persons so

341
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,638
that is not good

342
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,760
uh

343
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
yeah and it's not about the current law

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
but it's also for laws in the future

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
uh and you can see for the uh

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
the

347
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,399
new laws in the usa about our abortion

348
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,160
there's a lot of discussion about

349
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
location and apps that

350
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
could start data and stuff like that

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
so you have to be critical not only for

352
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,480
what's happening now but also what could

353
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
happen in the future

354
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,160
so

355
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
so the

356
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,399
the municipality getting a fine of six

357
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,760
hundred thousand

358
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,279
it all started in

359
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,480
six september 2017 and they

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
announced that

361
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
they were proud we're going to do that

362
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
and stuff like that okay

363
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
and right from the start i had some

364
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
questions about yeah but nice you do do

365
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
it but how it's called how is the

366
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,959
security uh

367
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,920
take care of and stuff like that

368
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,959
and that

369
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
i also found the completed 50 minutes

370
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,079
bill itself didn't work and then i filed

371
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
a complaint with the ap

372
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
took a little bit of time but in it

373
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
finally was signed

374
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
and it was a big news so

375
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,399
i gonna hurry leon a little bit

376
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,399
so in the official campaign i had some

377
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
official reasons why they shouldn't do

378
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,199
that

379
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
so the first reason is the municipality

380
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
has certain tasks and

381
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
yeah tracking around people is not the

382
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
task of the municipality so

383
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
there's a reason one

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
reason to should be professional

385
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
personal uh so

386
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,360
um you have to balance the the what you

387
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
do and you what you're gonna store about

388
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,639
data

389
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,279
and um yeah what is the impact for the

390
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
persons itself and that was a good

391
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
another good way to

392
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
do that

393
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,199
the third reason

394
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,480
and i find that the most important one

395
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
if you're walking around in the city you

396
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,959
should be

397
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
in observed so you should be

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,399
around without

399
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
people who are tracking you

400
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,759
um and it's a law in the the dutch law

401
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,639
in the uae law and human rights so

402
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,519
and

403
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
yeah because his law we shouldn't have

404
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,959
any discussion about that so

405
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
i find sometimes strange we have

406
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
discussion about privacy but that's

407
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,600
whole other story

408
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,920
yep

409
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
and the last one is

410
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
they should consent that just like if

411
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
you go to website you have the cookies

412
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
uh and stuff like that

413
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
um yeah that is not part of the vp

414
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
protocol but there is not reason to do

415
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,000
that anyway

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,959
and the rmc said yeah we have an opt-out

417
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
register so you can uh

418
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
resist your mech address there

419
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
yeah it's kind of strange you need your

420
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,279
mac address for that

421
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
and in the talks

422
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,279
they

423
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,079
said that not many use many users used

424
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,000
it so for a

425
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
city like ants today you have to

426
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
think about 10th 20th 30th something

427
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
like that so

428
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
you could of course turn off the mobile

429
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,720
and all do all kind of other things

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
but it is kind of the upside down world

431
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
so you should be able to walk walk

432
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
around where you want and you shouldn't

433
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,680
be do ever do all kind of strange thing

434
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,959
to protect your privacy

435
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,039
so uh

436
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,760
when this was public as they

437
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
said uh yeah but we did never had some

438
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,119
kind of warning uh that's not fully true

439
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
because the ap already sent some letters

440
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
uh before the discussion

441
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,359
um and that was kind of the

442
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,679
uh summary of the letters is yeah you

443
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,559
can use with wi-fi tracking but only in

444
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
very specific cases so

445
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,840
like

446
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
in big events and crowd control and that

447
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,039
kind of situations

448
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,000
24

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
7 in the inner city

450
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,080
is not a special case i think so

451
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,320
um yeah and what i already said uh yeah

452
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,400
hustling around a little bit of data

453
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
with mac address and hashes and stuff

454
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
like that is not enough to uh

455
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
do the privacy good

456
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,720
um and

457
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
rvc is the stakeholder or that he has a

458
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
commercial interest in this

459
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,880
um i think the

460
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
municipality eventually listened a

461
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,440
little bit too much to the company

462
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,000
and if they had an

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
external

464
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
specialist on the right moment

465
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
maybe they could avoid this

466
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,679
fine so

467
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,039
i'm going to skip this one

468
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,400
um

469
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
so

470
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
i get some sometimes remark for oh

471
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
you're special you do this and stuff

472
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
like that

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,039
but actually i didn't do anything

474
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,000
special so it is something that everyone

475
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
can do

476
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,559
it takes a little bit of time

477
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,240
because you have to wait long times

478
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
before answers and stuff like that

479
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,280
but

480
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
yeah in the end

481
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
i only spent two or three weeks

482
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
actual time to write letters and to

483
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
write emails and stuff like that spread

484
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
out over

485
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,600
four years now so that is not so bad

486
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
so i wrote two formal letters

487
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,080
and i uh keep track from hey i should

488
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
have an answer now i don't have an

489
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,799
answer what's the status so

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,360
and most importantly you have to be stay

491
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
polite friendly

492
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,840
and you have to yeah be

493
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
and don't

494
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
let it down and if you do that

495
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
i think everyone can do that so

496
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
and if not you can email me or twitter

497
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
me or whatever

498
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,280
maybe i can help you also

499
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
and this is just some numbers for the

500
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,400
fun

501
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,120
so that was kind of my speech

502
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,720
so we have some time for

503
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,640
questions so yeah thank you very much

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,240
if you have please come over here to the

508
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,559
microphone because then also the people

509
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,320
at home can hear them

510
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
and they like it that's easier yeah just

511
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,159
take that one that's uh that's the best

512
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,440
one

513
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
a complaint about the dpa is that they

514
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,840
are quite understaffed how made how did

515
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
you make the case that this was worth

516
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,559
for them to pursue

517
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,240
what i did i just

518
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,880
wrote a letter

519
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,600
and

520
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
pointed out all the points

521
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
and then the ddpa itself is going to

522
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,280
investigate and say see if it's really

523
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
worth the afford to do that

524
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
and the ep dpa in the netherlands is

525
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
understaffed

526
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
so they have to be picky about what they

527
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
do and what they don't do

528
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,760
so

529
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
your letter was good enough

530
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
sorry the letter was good enough yeah

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,559
but did they explain like uh this is

532
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
about the amount of people that are

533
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
tracked or about location that's more

534
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,159
sensitive why did how did they weigh it

535
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
that high

536
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
so there is a repot with

537
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
5

538
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,520
58 pages

539
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
and the the the

540
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,919
knight walker is also in there

541
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,280
so if you can

542
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,679
read that you can read it

543
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,600
all of us here i don't know if you can

544
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,320
uh translate a pdf easily in google

545
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
translate or something like that

546
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
okay so re read the

547
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
uh reports so

548
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
cool thanks thanks for doing this i live

549
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
here so no problem

550
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,000
cool question from the back

551
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
right

552
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
okay so i was wondering if it was

553
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
considered that the mac address can be

554
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
actually completely reversed because you

555
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
have only a couple of you know a mac

556
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
address has like six bytes and the first

557
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
three bytes

558
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,280
are known there's only a couple thousand

559
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
ouis which is a list of thousands or so

560
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
combinations that are fixed and the last

561
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
is 24 bits and considering that we have

562
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
um like this um crypto

563
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
bitcoin machines that are incredibly

564
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
quick in actually generating all these i

565
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,080
think it can be recovered in real time

566
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,919
but i also think with uh you don't even

567
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,559
need a really big rainbow table to do

568
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
a lookup table that is incredibly quick

569
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
and doesn't need too much space actually

570
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,880
have you considered this because i think

571
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,840
the whole scheme can be completely

572
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,000
reversed i i considered it but i didn't

573
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
do the math but you actually need query

574
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
database and calculations and stuff like

575
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
that so but i'm familiar with rainbow uh

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,480
do you want me to do that for you

577
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
yeah but but right now it's i'm not

578
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,000
involved in the discussion anymore so uh

579
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,360
perhaps municipality once

580
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,320
we can't talk later so

581
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
thank you okay

582
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,159
try this one yeah ah it does work it

583
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,799
does work um i found this feature on my

584
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,960
phone it says in the wi-fi settings

585
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
randomize your mac address do you know

586
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
about it and do you think it helps uh

587
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
yeah but in this case it was already we

588
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,919
started in 2017 so that was not as

589
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,679
common as now

590
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
and they filter out the uh

591
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,240
random addresses but i don't know how

592
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,880
many people uh of the

593
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
yeah normal uh do that yeah it is quite

594
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
new indeed yeah thank you okay

595
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
and how is how is this now done for all

596
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,919
the other municipalities who all where

597
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
this also was done

598
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
uh they they vote for what happens

599
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
what's going to happen in escalating

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,039
and they're very yeah they really keep

601
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,279
track uh about it because it's uh yeah

602
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,799
if something happened actually on a

603
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,320
wi-fi area

604
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,559
it's not only for instance but for all

605
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,960
your municipalities and maybe even for

606
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
your europe but i i'm not sure about

607
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,880
that so

608
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
and they do you know if they stopped it

609
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
in all the other months

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
no no they stopped it so they don't do

611
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,640
that anymore

612
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
well um i have a question about the fine

613
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
because

614
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
did where did the money go to the six

615
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,080
hundred thousand did they did the

616
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
government just find the government

617
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
because yeah that money they'll just end

618
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
up with the government again so what

619
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
point does it make yeah yeah but this is

620
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
more about uh principles itself so

621
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,039
all right

622
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,880
but yourself yeah

623
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,240
the government gets fined to the

624
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
government that's right

625
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,640
i think the the news and the amount of

626
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,080
money might harm the careers of the

627
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,840
people in the government are unharmed

628
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
make them war think twice again on this

629
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,120
yeah

630
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
i was curious about that as well how was

631
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,159
the reaction of the moon principality

632
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,600
what did they agree in the end

633
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
totally not

634
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
now that almost the first response

635
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
we're going to fight it and then we're

636
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,559
going to

637
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,000
go fully in it uh so the they already

638
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,799
spent uh

639
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,360
145

640
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
000 on the lawyers cost and the process

641
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,320
that has to start so

642
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
yes i'm very curious uh if everything is

643
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
finished uh what the uh the costs are

644
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
and if it's maybe then even more than

645
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
the original fine so

646
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
so the government is suing the

647
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,919
government as well yeah yeah but but

648
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
it's very principled and uh itself wants

649
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
to know but they also want to know for

650
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,679
the other municipalities and yeah that

651
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,000
makes sense so that that's probably the

652
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
reason why they do that so

653
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
cool

654
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,279
any more questions

655
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,200
i have a question for the audience oh

656
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
yeah wow cool

657
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,840
so uh i know the in germany the

658
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,919
they are very strict about privacy laws

659
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,400
but it's totally unclear how the wi-fi

660
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,840
tracking or

661
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,080
this kind of things works in germany so

662
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,799
if someone knows details about details

663
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
about this i would like to hear that

664
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,880
cool anyone who wants to say something

665
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
now that might be a bit yeah quick

666
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
otherwise afterwards walk to the speaker

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,159
or is someone

668
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,679
no no

669
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,640
okay

670
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,919
cool thank you very much

671
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,840
you
