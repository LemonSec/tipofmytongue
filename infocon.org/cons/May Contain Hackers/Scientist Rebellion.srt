do

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
what we aim to achieve uh

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
what methods can be used there

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,880
um the opportunities that we see well

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
specifically in the field of non-violent

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
civil disobedience

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
then scientists rebellion itself what

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
have we done what we're going to do

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,120
and

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
lastly what can you do to help out

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
well first about myself

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,760

sdb group a large sas

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
in healthcare

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
very long ago i

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
was one of the editors at hectic

25
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,680
know

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,720

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
which i've now been doing for about

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
10 years longer probably

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,479
and which i'd love to get help with so

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,280
if you're into politics let me know

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
um

36
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,159
um the cti league admin cti league is a

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,520
group

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,799
of

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,520
cti specialists which

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
help out specifically healthcare

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
yeah in kovhi times there was a lot

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
of ransomware attacks and well we tried

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,759
to help out best we could

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,079
scientifically well i'm a master of

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,399
science artificial intelligence

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
at the university of amsterdam

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,360
i've

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,959
done my father he was one of the chief

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,720
scientists at

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
the canada meet the dutch meteorological

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,239
institute

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
and i actually did a

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
research article with him on using

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
artificial intelligence in meteorology

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
which was quite fun thing to do

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
um

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
and well i

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
like footnotes i like i really like

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
things with good sources that you can

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
check for yourself and well not the

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,599
yeah social media stuff

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
um so

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
why do we bother

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
um

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you probably know but it's good out

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
there i'll briefly go into this

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,599
um

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,120
droughts and floods are really happening

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
yeah in a

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,840
stuff yeah a very increasing uh

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
trajectory um the horn of africa the

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
southern part now has had uh many

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
droughts in a row and the nomads there

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
actually

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
yeah don't really

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
have their life anymore because yeah the

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
kettle is gone and yeah they need to

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
find a new way of living because the

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
environment has just become too hostile

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
and it's i think that's way

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,239
underreported in europe in well in the

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
western countries

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
yeah um well germany you also see i mean

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,959
it's hitting europe uh the likelihood of

85
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,760
severe floods has increased by factor

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
1.2 so that's 20 percent at least

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
and nine so 900 percent uh

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
it's yeah it's

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,120
very quickly uh getting worse

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,879
heatwaves are really worldwide uh yeah

91
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
the norm uh use well these graphs you

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
probably uh know them

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
this uh shows in dark blue yeah a bit

94
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
cooler uh temperatures and yeah the

95
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
darker red it gets the hotter and

96
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,000
worldwide these are all different

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
continents

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
the temperatures all the record

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,280
temperatures are well the last decennium

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,880
in india recently uh jacob about hits 50

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
centi cent degrees i mean this is

102
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
we may really make parts of the world

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
unlivable

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,199
and yeah in europe we have yeah we were

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
quite lucky to be in a relatively cool

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
area but

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
also there it's getting a lot hotter i

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
actually made these slides before the

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
heat waves that's well just have just

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,919
happened uh so that that's just an

111
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,960
encore

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,919
um yeah july 2019 there were

113
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,720
1435 heat related deaths in france which

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
uh yeah of which about 35 percent can

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
for certain be uh

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,919
linked to global warming

117
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
um yeah in

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,479
america uh in the u.s

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
the heat waves are 150 times more likely

120
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
and this this is not just some

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,199
random article this is from nature

122
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,320
well we as techies are also already

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
being hit

124
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,680
just last week

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
google and oracle had cloud outages

126
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,199
because they couldn't take the heat

127
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
yeah

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
because it's so

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
rapidly increasing

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
on the other hand yeah also due to

131
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
warming ants pollution uh

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
coral is dying on an

133
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
yeah a tremendous scale

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,199
and coral is really well the foundation

135
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
of underwater life

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
so yeah we've lost about 30 to 50

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
percent since

138
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
1980 so well that you

139
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
can understand the impact and it's

140
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
getting worse

141
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
um

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
so um yeah

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
one last thing uh the

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
because the weather makes the weather

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe makes the harvest uh yeah more

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
unpredictable you can have

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
certainly a huge heat wave or suddenly

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
that the field is

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
totally underwater and then yeah the

150
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,560
crops are gone so yeah expect more of

151
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
that

152
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,680
um

153
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,880
the biodiversity uh loss it's it's a

154
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,919
related problem that's partly due to the

155
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,599
heat but also due to uh yeah the very uh

156
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
the lots of poisons that we use to try

157
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,039
to keep our agriculture

158
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
ever on the incline

159
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
so yeah it's

160
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,160
not really good

161
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,039
ipcc for those who don't know it

162
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,840
it's

163
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,199
international community on

164
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah incredible worldwide scale of

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
researchers or for about any

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
specialty

167
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
which together and that's really unique

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
in in world history

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
worldwide together they try to find a

170
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,880
consensus on what is happening in the

171
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
world and swell their

172
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
consensus is

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
we have a brief and rapidly closing

174
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
window of opportunity to secure a

175
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
livable and sustainable future

176
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,360
very high confidence well very high

177
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
confidence in

178
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
science scientific terms you don't just

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
throw that around then you really need

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
to be very certain

181
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,280
so what needs to be done

182
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
and now um i'll align with the

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,479
extinction rebellion

184
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
demands which

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
yeah i have been very well put together

186
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
there are a lot of scientists uh

187
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,160
in extinction rebellion also outside of

188
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,720
uh scientist rebellion which i'll get to

189
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,759
later

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
overarching is

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
climate justice and that's that

192
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
there is a fair transition

193
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,559
enabling everybody around the world to

194
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,760
together

195
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,519
solve this problem

196
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
and currently well

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
the western world is here we are

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,599
causing

199
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
most of the pollution

200
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
um

201
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,600
and

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
yeah we should

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
invest

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
equal amounts in order to solve it

205
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,959
the

206
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah half of the population hardly emits

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
any co2 compared to us

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
but yeah they are the people who have

209
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
the most problems with it

210
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
then the first demand this uh for the

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
previous one was number zero

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
um tell the truth

213
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,880
and that's that um politicians and

214
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
the media need to

215
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
honestly tell us what we're facing and

216
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
uh not schedule it away

217
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
um

218
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200
well

219
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
here's our two dutch

220
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
posts

221
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
from recent times

222
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
from start which is all

223
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,720
high

224
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
uridial presence

225
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
they say well the

226
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
climate

227
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
action that the government does is

228
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,839
far

229
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,120
is way

230
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
insufficient

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
so yeah they really should do a lot more

232
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,839
and well for the part of the media

233
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
if you have a subtitle

234
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,720
400 extra debt due to a heat wave

235
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
a lot of 80 pluses are

236
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
half deceased and then you put a picture

237
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
of

238
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,680
a woman at the beach then i think as the

239
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,640
media you failed

240
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,680
there's actually catch-22 here that

241
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
politicians journalists and the general

242
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,399
public sort of

243
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
keep

244
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
each other

245
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
from uh from accent

246
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,839
politicians are voted away when they

247
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
do stuff that the general public doesn't

248
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
want doesn't enjoy

249
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,720
journalists uh they are not rats

250
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
when they

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
uh bring bitter news they

252
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,839
like to sugarcoat it's a bit

253
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,880
if they

254
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,839
really

255
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,560
bring it harshly then they just won't

256
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
get red as much

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
and the general public

258
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,959
they expect the journalists and the

259
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,160
politicians to inform us

260
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
and well be honest about this

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
and so they

262
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,279
think in general if they yeah don't have

263
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,640
a scientific background if they don't

264
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
really dive into it from okay well it's

265
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
it's nice i mean i can go to go to the

266
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
pool every now and then

267
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,000
um

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,640
and yeah so a search they vote for

269
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
politicians who don't want all this

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
hard action

271
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
in the meantime we have

272
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079
oil companies and

273
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
other companies which have a short-term

274
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,560
benefit from keeping the status quo

275
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,519
and they have a lot of techniques

276
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,320
to

277
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
keep us from

278
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
getting active

279
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
uh they lobby a lot uh so so they are 10

280
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,320
to one

281
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
outspends uh

282
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,239
yeah

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,120
organizations like greenpeace like

284
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
maya defense etc

285
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
which lobby for

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
better climate action

287
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
yeah the politicians who don't want to

288
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
move to say well we need more

289
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
measurements or well it's just too

290
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
expensive we can do it

291
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,959
and

292
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,360
yeah they refer to bad signs in order to

293
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
keep us from moving

294
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
and yeah portray

295
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
concerned activists at extremists that's

296
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
unfortunately what's happening

297
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,120
and even though it's quite

298
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
a bargain to solve climate change um

299
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,959
the

300
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
ipcc has calculated how much it would

301
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
take

302
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,399
and this is from 2018 so the price has

303
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,880
gone up a bit but

304
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
yeah not orders of magnitudes

305
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
um they need 2.4 trillion us dollar and

306
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
you think hey that's a lot but

307
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
it's two and a half percent of the

308
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
world's gdp so if

309
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
every country on earth uh

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,399
yeah yields two and a half percent of

311
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,079
its gdp and i think with covid's

312
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
higher prices were paid

313
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
then

314
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720
and yeah and if we use that to wisely

315
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,639
invest then

316
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
we can at least stay

317
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,839
with one and a half to two

318
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,560
per

319
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,279
cent degrees

320
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
so yeah every year that we don't do

321
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,240
anything uh another an additional 0.3 to

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,519
0.9 trillion dollars

323
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
are actually thrown away so in action

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
costs a lot of money because we have to

325
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,839
fix it later

326
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,440
in the meantime our government is still

327
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,920
investing in the

328
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
fossil sector with about eight

329
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
billion a year which yeah it's it's

330
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
madness

331
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
as antonio guterres

332
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
also said uh climate activists are

333
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals

334
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,760
but the truly dangerous radicals are the

335
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
countries that are increasing the

336
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
production of fossil fuels

337
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,040
investing in new fossil fuels

338
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,839
infrastructure is moral and economic

339
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,480
madness and then yeah also notice the

340
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
economic world so even if

341
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
you would have no morals it is still

342
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
very foolish to

343
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,439
not act

344
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
so it's good to learn from past mistakes

345
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
like you'd like to remind you of the

346
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
coal energy

347
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
yeah in 2016

348
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
a new center was opened while

349
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,680
many people many scientists already said

350
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
don't do this this is

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,079
madness

352
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
some political parties still thought it

353
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,959
was a good idea

354
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
cheap

355
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,199
and now in 2022 so that's

356
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
six years after uh opening

357
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
yeah we have this problem we actually

358
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
need to stop it well now we have

359
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,199
this

360
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
problem with

361
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
gas so well now we're opening it

362
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
we're starting them again if we would

363
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
have invested in

364
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,519
alternative energy means

365
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
we would have

366
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,560
fixed

367
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,920
several problems in one go

368
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
then now

369
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,639
the

370
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,639
yeah the minises

371
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
will want to

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,519
search for new gas well they have

373
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,800
searched they want to open new gas

374
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,839
fields

375
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
in the northeast

376
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,920
which yeah completely contradicts ipcc

377
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
they say yeah they say coal and gas

378
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
fired power plants will likely need to

379
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
retire about 25 years earlier in the

380
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,959
past yeah

381
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,480
or if you want to stay within 1.5

382
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
30 years early

383
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
the risks of stranded power plants that

384
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,279
you can't use are greatest in countries

385
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
with newer fossil infrastructure well

386
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
this fossil fuel infrastructure doesn't

387
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,079
even exist yet and

388
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
yeah they want to go there and

389
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
it's not that then tomorrow uh they'll

390
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,240
have gas they hope it's uh

391
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,079
that they sell it like well it will be

392
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
one to three years but yeah i think the

393
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,079
three years

394
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
is already

395
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
a

396
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
yeah quite optimistic uh time scale uh

397
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,280
yeah normally it's about five years plus

398
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
and then you're just starting to use

399
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,319
this fossil fuel

400
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,520
um

401
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,160
so uh what we think is a solution as

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
extinction rebellion is

403
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,760
citizens assembly this is not some

404
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
strange radical idea it has been tried

405
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
and tested

406
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
in several countries already

407
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
um

408
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,799
you have a cross-section of the public

409
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,240
so really a fair representation of

410
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
yeah all walks of life of

411
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
whatever divisions you make

412
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
they are informed by several experts

413
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,760
some they may not agree with each other

414
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
and that's fine but they really should

415
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
be respected people in their fields

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,000
then there are extensive roundtable

417
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,440
discussions

418
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
within this group

419
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,720
and they can ask more expertise

420
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
and then

421
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
in the end

422
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
they come to a conclusion um yeah this

423
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
is what we should do

424
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
and

425
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
if you do this rights and that is if you

426
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,640
give them a mandate

427
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
this

428
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,120
can work very well to bring changes that

429
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,160
otherwise you just couldn't sell

430
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,600
to

431
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,559
your

432
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,919
population

433
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,280
for example

434
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,400
ireland is a famous case their

435
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,039
abortion was uh discussed and at length

436
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
and yeah finally the country

437
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
agreed of course there are still people

438
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
against but they agreed uh

439
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
yeah that abortion shouldn't be

440
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
completely

441
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
illegal everywhere um

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
and

443
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,960
yeah this wouldn't have been possible uh

444
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
yeah without

445
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
the citizen assembly

446
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
people really thought okay my

447
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
yeah persons that i identify with are

448
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
yeah

449
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,440
i have said this is a wise choice and

450
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
well there is transparency

451
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
so i can look into why and yeah that

452
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
that works perfectly

453
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
on the other hand there have also been

454
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,600
citizens assemblies where uh

455
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
yeah the

456
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
the group made a recommendation and

457
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
the government didn't like that and did

458
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
something else anyway and

459
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,760
that's not a fertile ground for a future

460
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,039
uh

461
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
uh the future of this process

462
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,640
so in ireland france germany uk belgium

463
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440
this has been done for climates uh

464
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
changed matters and uh quite

465
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,679
uh yeah

466
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
quite successfully uh in france uh yeah

467
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
most of the recommendations were applied

468
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
some

469
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
not but yeah most were and it's

470
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
uh it works very well

471
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
so yeah these are the extinction

472
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
rebellion demands which are the same for

473
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,360
scientists rebellion as well a sister

474
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
group we

475
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
fully support us

476
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,000
um so

477
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
how can we

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
help uh make this change

479
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
um for scientists yeah i think you're

480
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,360
the science officer and uh all the

481
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
measurements that you see

482
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
they show you well okay this we're

483
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,640
heading to this iceberg

484
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
and you already feel the

485
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
bit wobbly

486
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
it's yeah you think okay this is not

487
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,400
good

488
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
um you've sent several notices uh in

489
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,240
yeah with

490
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
more and more exclamation marks uh but

491
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
it's not getting true the captain is too

492
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
busy entertaining the guests and so he

493
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,320
doesn't want any certain ship moves

494
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
um

495
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,080
so

496
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
he's saying well okay let's just carry

497
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
on and let the engineer think of a magic

498
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,280
fix so that yeah we can suddenly move

499
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
this boat

500
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
yeah 90 degrees starboard

501
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
well as a science officer you can write

502
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,039
another alert well

503
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,400
for climate change

504
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
this was the world scientist warning of

505
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
climate emergency

506
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,280
it was underwritten by over 11 000

507
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,640
scientists

508
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,679
and

509
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,280
yeah

510
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
nothing has been done with that

511
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,679
so

512
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
yeah

513
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,760
getting a bit fed up

514
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
um well as a person yeah you can

515
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
vote

516
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
and absolutely everybody should do this

517
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,799
and yeah four parties uh who have a

518
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,039
provable track record of caring for your

519
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
future

520
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
um

521
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,559
yeah with this uh four-year election

522
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,919
cycle it is a bit difficult that people

523
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
that politicians fear being voted away

524
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
if they do anything rash

525
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
um they're still

526
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,840
limited climate science awareness and

527
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
yeah all these

528
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,679
disinformation campaigns that we talked

529
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,000
about

530
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
so

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
here you see a list of all kinds of

532
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
climate

533
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,200
protests actions that have been done in

534
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,440
the past these this these are groupings

535
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,559
there are still

536
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
a lot uh yeah there are a lot also

537
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
outside of this but this is

538
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,880
a good catalogue with how many times

539
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,919
certain actions were done

540
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
and well you see petitions campaigns

541
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
street protests

542
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,159
well importance of ngos

543
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,080
yeah many different

544
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
things which have been done a lot

545
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
but yeah with

546
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,760
limited success the green

547
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360
bullets are

548
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
yeah completely legal actions

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
the blue

550
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,080
are civil disobediences and instead in

551
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
the case of strikes well it can be legal

552
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
it's

553
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
is not always the case

554
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,000
um the rat in the bottom that is

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
potentially violent actions like yeah

556
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
property damage sabotage

557
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
this is not something that exchange

558
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
rebellion uh supports advises we think

559
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
it's counterproductive uh and that

560
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,120
doesn't uh yields yeah you with any

561
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,559
benefit

562
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,840
um

563
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,520
so um

564
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,279
yeah these

565
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
there is a wide range of actions

566
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,760
and uh

567
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
yeah

568
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
it's hard to

569
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
quantify exactly which

570
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,840
is responsible for what because

571
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,679
oftentimes we use several different

572
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,799
actions

573
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,000
and we think

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,279
well we know

575
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,720
uh that that's all that's also the best

576
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,559
to really diversify to not to do one uh

577
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,919
kind of action to only petition to only

578
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
do a lawsuit

579
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
or do only a non-violent

580
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,880
disobedience act

581
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,840
but to combine

582
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,240
several types and that's much much more

583
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
effective to put pressure

584
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,360
from different sites

585
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,279
so

586
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
here first i want to talk here about

587
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
legal actions there have

588
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,039
spread yeah

589
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,400
very good work

590
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
is being done uh

591
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,600
ergenda matzak

592
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
probably the most dutch people will know

593
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,120
it

594
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
there was a case against the government

595
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,000
because the government did too little to

596
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,159
protect its citizens against the climate

597
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,480
change

598
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,400
the that was one

599
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
so the judge said they should

600
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,440
immediately

601
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
do more

602
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
than

603
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
the government counter suits because

604
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
they didn't want to do more

605
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
which was also one so now grudgingly

606
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
they are uh

607
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
yeah doing more but yeah it's not from

608
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,480
the heart

609
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,360
um

610
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,480
actually last week in the uk a similar

611
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
case was one also in high court because

612
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,799
the government didn't really want to do

613
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
anything so

614
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
in the uk there's also

615
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
hope with that

616
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,000
well mayor defensey is also a

617
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,679
famous case they have suits shell

618
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,720
to

619
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
clean up its act because it is

620
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,320
responsible for

621
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,120
a

622
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,320
huge

623
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,640
amount of the public pollution worldwide

624
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
other oil companies same thing but this

625
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,240
was also a test case if

626
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,440
shell must do it then in all likelihood

627
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,400
the other oil companies also should

628
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
um

629
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
so

630
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah this is also uh yeah the more cases

631
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
are being prepared

632
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
then a very fundamental

633
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
case is ecocide

634
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
well of course you know genocide

635
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,880
ecocide is yeah the nature's equivalent

636
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,240
if you

637
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,360
damage a lot of nature um

638
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,240
then

639
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
you should

640
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,760
yeah it should be able to

641
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,559
sue you and keep you responsible for

642
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,000
that crime

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
and uh yeah top lawyers are now working

644
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
on this uh yeah very slowly but yeah to

645
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
make this happen worldwide that takes a

646
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
lot of time but

647
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,440
they're yeah they're doing very good uh

648
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
things here

649
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
so yeah this takes a lot it's vital but

650
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
it takes a long time

651
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,880
um then

652
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
we get to another

653
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
yeah yeah more r just

654
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,399
nonviolent civil disobedience

655
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,600
i like to start with some examples

656
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
in the past

657
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,039
women suffrage

658
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,200
women were fed up with not being able to

659
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,279
have to two votes

660
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
and for a long time they asked very

661
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,720
friendly uh please can we vote and well

662
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
that didn't really do much for them

663
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,240
so the surfer jets movements came up and

664
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,360
yeah they

665
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
tied themselves uh

666
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
two rails in order to not be protest uh

667
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,720
not not be removed immediately yeah they

668
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,159
are one you know

669
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
some of the first uh

670
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
yeah known cases for

671
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,640
mass civil disobedience and well

672
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
it worked for them and yeah we're better

673
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,279
for it

674
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,159
then

675
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,180
a lot of

676
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,559
[Music]

677
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
civil disobedience is also in the case

678
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
of systemic discrimination there are a

679
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
lot of famous cases martin luther king

680
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,880
is of course a very well-known example

681
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
but also uh yeah colonel west he's a

682
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,640
professor from princeton

683
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,600
and he has also been several times uh

684
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,399
arrested uh yeah for

685
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,440
uh

686
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,159
yeah for for protesting against racial

687
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,960
discrimination

688
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
recently also 31 harvard professors that

689
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
was in 2017 that was against the daca

690
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,279
which

691
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,279
was a quite evil

692
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,640
legislative

693
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,120

uh

712
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,480
in the vietnam war and then yeah the

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,039
ah

719
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,080
says

720
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
yep

721
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,279
all right we're back

722
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,559
um okay well i hope you read through the

723
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,159
slides um well now yeah last case

724
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,880
the nuclear arms build up carl sagan

725
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,200
yeah which is uh probably one of the

726
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,919
most famous scientists

727
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,440
of the last century um yeah he was also

728
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
arrested

729
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,520
for

730
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
yeah against this nuclear arms buildup

731
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,520
so there are a lot of examples uh

732
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,279
for the yeah of scientists uh which yeah

733
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,760
hit the streets

734
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,799
um

735
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,600
then

736
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,320
uh yeah for the climate emergency

737
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
we also uh yeah

738
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
see no alternative to

739
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,559
also yeah hit the streets because

740
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
writing more papers yeah that's

741
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
apparently doesn't work

742
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,279
so yeah greta

743
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,919
is yeah he was she was not a scientist

744
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,399
yet she was just in education but yeah

745
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,440
she broke the law with her

746
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
school strike

747
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
and that

748
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,440
well set up a whole movement so that was

749
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,799
good

750
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,080
um

751
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
so yeah here you see a more recent uh

752
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
example uh

753
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
yeah where actually

754
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
friends from scientists rebellion are

755
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
also active

756
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,679
yeah blocking

757
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
um

758
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
yeah well

759
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,159
i want to

760
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
repeat myself there are

761
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
a lot of

762
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,960
professionals which are really yeah

763
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,039
don't want to take it any longer have

764
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
tried all the normal

765
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,399
ways of getting their message across and

766
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,239
yeah it just doesn't work

767
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,440
so then we get to scientist rebellion

768
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,240
i guess most people know extinction

769
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,559
rebellion uh but

770
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
i'll very briefly explain the

771
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,240
relationship between different

772
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
organizations

773
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,000
let me start by fridays for future this

774
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,120
is the movement that greta thundberg

775
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,919
has initiated

776
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,840
its yeah it has education affinity um

777
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,720
it's they have some civil disobedience

778
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,200
uh but then only yeah only the strikes

779
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,200
um real scientists which have graduated

780
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
you have scientists for future which is

781
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
actually quite big in the netherlands

782
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
and you have scientists rebellion which

783
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
is sort of the

784
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,600
rebellious sister of scientists for

785
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,120
future

786
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
we know each other very well

787
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,399
many people are in both organizations

788
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,080
and

789
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,760
yeah we have a very good

790
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
standing relationship

791
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,679
scientist for future

792
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,960
doesn't do

793
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
civil disobedience scientist rebellion

794
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,559
does

795
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,960
then extension rebellion of course you

796
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,799
know

797
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
they've been yeah i've been eating these

798
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,840
trees quite a lot

799
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,279
have a

800
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
sister group university rebellion which

801
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,399
is actually

802
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,440
students which have not graduated yet

803
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,279
but yeah also

804
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
yeah do civil disobedience at the

805
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,240
university

806
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,120
and

807
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
yeah um

808
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
besides the educational angle you have

809
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
lawyers for extinction rebellion you

810
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,640
have healthcare professionals for

811
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,399
exchange you're well you have a lot of

812
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,719
different

813
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,799
subgroups which have all uh different

814
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
focus and so we get

815
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,399
along together quite well

816
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
scientist rebellion is active in a lot

817
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,720
of countries these are just that i know

818
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,600
of but i may have skipped some

819
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
our actions should be as targeted as

820
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,440
possible while just like xinjin

821
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
we have actions at

822
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,279
large-scale investors in pollutions like

823
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,199
banks pension funds

824
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,560
and 12 big companies which also could do

825
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,760
better

826
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,440
um and

827
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,159
yeah at key decision makers and then

828
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,159
yeah we get to the government where we

829
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
do a lot of actions

830
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
and ministries and um

831
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,918
also at other government bodies

832
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:28,879
um

833
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,040
and yeah we also

834
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,199
do public awareness raising mostly at

835
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,598
cases

836
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,960
we do yeah mostly

837
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,719
at places which have a link to either

838
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,239
yeah one of the previous two groups yeah

839
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,119
yep um this should

840
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,879

is this working okay yeah all right well

854
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
uh then we go do it like this

855
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
um well this is an example action uh

856
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,760
this is an example action of uh

857
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,119
scientist rebellion in berlin um where

858
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,520
fourteen scientists were blocking the

859
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,440
chrome platzenburg

860
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,760
which is uh quite in the center of uh

861
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,040
berlin

862
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
we had too much demand stronger

863
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
political action

864
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,839
in

866
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,520
madrid uh there was also a large group

uh yeah which went

868
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,960
uh sorry uh we went to the national

869
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,079
congress

870
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,560
and uh yeah they spilled fake

871
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
biodegradable easily washable

872
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,119
blood to

873
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
show all the

874
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,320
needless deaths that had been done by

875
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,079
not taking actions

876
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,440
well for reference about 37 percent of

877
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,680
the heat wave victims could be

878
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
fixed yeah

879
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
needed

880
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
uganda

881
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,240
is severely hit by climate change they

882
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,560
have several roadblocks to demand

883
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,640
stronger action

884
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,240
well this is my group

885
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,599
in the hague

886
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,680
we blocked for example the ministry of

887
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,359
economic affairs

888
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,040
there were seven arrests

889
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
also yeah for

890
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,800
requesting more action from the ministry

891
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,880
of economic affairs

892
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
uh there are many many many more too

893
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
many

894
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
to mention

895
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,680
so what can you do

896
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,119
don't be the dog

897
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,040
that's the first

898
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,240
um

899
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
it's good if you

900
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
yeah

901
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,480
as far as much as you aren't aware yet

902
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,440
study and share scientific consensus the

903
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,320
ipcc reports have a summary for policy

904
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,599
makers which is very easy to read

905
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,200
so i would

906
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
say well do the working group two and

907
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,880
the working group three

908
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,960
summaries they're

909
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
they're quite clear they're quite

910
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,079
obvious

911
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,400
uh of course yeah don't believe social

912
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,040
media claims without fact checking uh

913
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,280
there's this uh climate help desk for

914
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
dutch people

915
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
which in which you can really ask an

916
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,040
expert hey i don't get this oh yeah well

917
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,839
why is this happening and yeah they're

918
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
very good

919
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,560
um

920
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
speak up lead by example how imperfect

921
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,760
it might be you can't uh have

922
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,680
you you don't need to be perfect i mean

923
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
do what you can

924
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
use your privilege for goods

925
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,160
yeah

926
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
as i already mentioned voting for a

927
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,359
party which has a history

928
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,720
of caring for your future and your

929
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,680
kids future or your friends kids future

930
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,560
uh should be very easy to determine

931
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
which do and which don't

932
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,680
move your money to a company which

933
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
yeah does not invest itself

934
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,800
in polluting services

935
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,599
you can use as a dutchy

936
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,640
health visor for example

937
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,960
invest in green companies instead of

938
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,760
well for example proof of work coins

939
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,359
have a lot better return on investment

940
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,359
and please lower your emissions

941
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,839
uh netherlands community consumes about

942
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,400
3.6

943
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,280
times what's sustainable uh you have

944
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
this overshoot day which is actually

945
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,119
calculating on which day of the

946
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,560
of the year we actually used our carbon

947
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
credits for the year and

948
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,960
for the netherlands that's in april i

949
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
believe

950
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,680
uh yeah please fly less drive less

951
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
if you

952
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
need to drive

953
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,079
drive electric that really helps a lot

954
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
eat less or no meat or dairy because

955
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,599
they're very polluting

956
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,440
prefer plant-based

957
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,560
now it's very easy to do it used to be

958
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,200
more difficult but now in 2022 it's it's

959
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,720
very easy

960
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,520
and

961
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,280
yeah in general

962
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
buy less stuff

963
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
because yeah we really are a

964
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,599
very

965
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,040
consuming

966
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,079
uh

967
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,480
country welfare continent

968
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,440
and that's not good uh for example yeah

969
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,319
here uh is a

970
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,119
pile of clothing actually mountains of

971
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,640
clothing that are in uganda and also in

972
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,880
chile and these

973
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,440
these are clothing that are yeah just

974
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,880
haven't even made the stores but in this

975
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
fast fashion okay it's already outdated

976
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
it's just yeah thrown away

977
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,720
and well we don't see it

978
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
but it's there and it's

979
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,280
ever growing so yeah

980
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,079
try to buy less recycle

981
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,119
that helps

982
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,720
um then

983
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,760
second thing connect to peers

984
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
both of these

985
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
do not have a direct

986
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,680
non-violent direct action focus but

987
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,920
they're very good to join climate

988
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,480
action.tech is yeah for techies who want

989
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,520
to

990
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,800
make a change

991
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,520
uh it's a community with

992
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,720
a lot of activity it's uh yeah

993
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
join it if you're interested in this

994
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
topic

995
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,839
effective altruism

996
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,079
is also a very good

997
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,359
organization

998
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,040
they focus on high-impact philanthropy

999
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
and trying to avoid

1000
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,200
catastrophic risks and they're also very

1001
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,920
scientific in this and they

1002
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,200
can also advise on which uh

1003
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,040
goal yeah which goals you can

1004
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,680
which funds you can donate to to have

1005
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,560
the highest impacts either for climates

1006
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,760
or also for other uh topics

if non-violent direct action doesn't

1018
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,720
scare you

1019
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,040

presentation you gave a very concise

1077
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,160
overview like a true scientist of what

1078
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,319
happened so far and you were telling it

1079
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,880
to us with a friendly smile on your face

1080
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,079
presenting the facts why are you not mad

1081
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,680
as hell

1082
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,839
i am mad as hell i

1083
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,520
actually before this talk uh i

1084
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,760
talked with other people on the camp and

1085
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,359
said well i hope

1086
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,800
that

1087
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,079
yeah my emotion doesn't

1088
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,560
get the better of me that i can't

1089
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,200
present this

1090
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,960
so this is my way of coping

1091
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:06,070
[Applause]

1092
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,480
the science i hear about climate usually

1093
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,960
is physical or

1094
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,119
environmental and that sort of thing

1095
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,880
um are there also scientists from

1096
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,960
economy or from legal departments who

1097
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,760
could

1098
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,480
help citizens say

1099
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,960
this economist computed that they have

1100
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,880
wasted so much of the tax money and i

1101
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,800
refuse to pay it

1102
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,960
as a citizen i mean i think you can get

1103
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,000
60 million volunteers for that

1104
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,800
um well in

1105
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,640
scientific rebellion

1106
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,119
i don't think we have in

1107
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,400
extinction rebellion yeah there are also

1108
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,880
a lot of scientists yeah really from

1109
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
about all angles i

1110
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,680
i'm not sure about yeah economic

1111
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,359
professors because yeah that's that's

1112
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,880
sort of

1113
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,720
a sensitive topic

1114
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,280
in xr

1115
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,800
but

1116
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
yeah the lawyers there are a lot uh so

1117
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,200
that's

1118
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
this climate climate change date for

1119
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
every country you could say you're only

1120
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,160
entitled to pay your uh taxes until

1121
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,960
april if you're dutch

1122
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,119
yeah i mean and get legal part

1123
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,200
department to support that and have 60

1124
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,760
million uh in individual lawsuits

1125
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,400
against 60 million uh citizens that

1126
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,240
might get some people moving

1127
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,240
that's uh yeah i think it might uh

1128
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,839
and when to check signal in case there

1129
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,520
are any questions from no please do line

1130
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,680
up um no no no questions there so we

1131
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,720
have uh

1132
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,079
i think we have time for just uh one

1133
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,599
last question here thank you and one

1134
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,359
last question is um

1135
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,760
i saw the the options for donating as

1136
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,960
well

1137
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,200
but if there would be a fund that would

1138
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,760
would make it possible to to to donate

1139
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,880
to buy a lot of tractors for scientists

1140
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,360
would that help

1141
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,720
[Laughter]

1142
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,560
definitely

1143
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,599
but would would science rebellion be

1144
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,160
prepared to use them

1145
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,680
well scientists

1146
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,720
we have a yeah global

1147
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,680
it is a global organization and we only

1148
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
we we don't have a specific dutch but we

1149
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,640
have uh uh overarching uh

1150
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,440
uh donation uh possibility and then yeah

1151
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,400
we

1152
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,000
it's it's not earmarked uh as yet and

1153
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,359
uh also i must say that yeah the

1154
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,160
different countries are relatively uh

1155
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,720
autonomous and some have a slightly

1156
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,960
different perspective me not about the

1157
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,200
science but yeah about the best way to

1158
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,640
to do things

1159
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,760
um

1160
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,640
so yeah then there should be a specific

1161
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,279
fund for that

1162
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,839
