1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
my name is i work at the balance head

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
and i'm an open source investigator and

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,359
trainer okay

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,439
so uh yeah being an open source

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
investigator uh i do investigations um i

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
come from kyrgyzstan so my main focus is

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
in central asia but i'm also looking

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
into conspiracies in europe and

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,800
um data-driven investigations and many

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
many other things as well as the warrior

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,239
porting in ukraine but also in

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,399
tajikistan okay

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,079
and yeah let's dive into our

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,440
presentation

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
uh this will be a little bit interactive

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
at some points okay so i'll be needing

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
uh sometimes for you to raise your hands

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,559
so yeah the and the first question when

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,680
we were talking about open source

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
investigation is what is open source

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
investigation of course what is open

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
source research

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
and some of you might know

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,600
uh it is um

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
it's an investigation where a researcher

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
and a reader have uh equal access to the

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
information okay so how it happens in

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
traditional journalism journalists might

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
go

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
do do a field trip might do an interview

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
or have some sources they can reach out

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
to right but in open source

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
investigation researchers such as we

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
were doing everything at our laptops and

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
we're searching information uh that's

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,799
available publicly so theoretically if i

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
do an investigations uh you would be

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,759
able to do the same thing okay to

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
reiterate each step

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
so this is the main difference the

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
researcher which is a journalist analyst

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
or investigator has the same access to

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
information as the reader slash listener

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
okay

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
in our case we include the information

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
with the payroll being as open source so

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,600
this can be a subscription to a news

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
channel so say you want to subscribe to

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,119
an economist or a wall street journal it

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,479
costs a few bucks

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,360
and

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
of course

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
like in many cases there is a high

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,439
possibility

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,959
that somebody else has already written

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,479
about the subject you're interested in

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
yeah and then when we want to check out

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,840
this information of course we subscribe

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
and we'll read this info and we

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
think yeah this is also an open source

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
investment information because everyone

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
with a budget would get access to it so

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
this can be as cheap as a couple bucks

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,599
but or also expensive as uh being a

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,040
couple thousand of dollars for a

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
satellite imagery so we use satellite

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
imagery a lot at valencia uh it's

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
primarily googlers but we also have paid

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
subscription

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
to services like planet which costs yeah

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
i think around a thousand two thousand

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
dollars a month but uh this gives us an

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
access to a huge amount of satellite

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
imagery okay

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
so there is this um i'd say budget

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
barrier of course but we uh still

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
considered it's an open source

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,239
and uh why is this important because uh

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,560
when belka just launched in 2014 so it's

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
a relatively new organization and to

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,159
build trust

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
uh among our readers we uh

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
our founder decided to

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
do everything uh open source because he

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
really liked it he was really into it

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
and then he could see that when he did

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
an open source investigations readers

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
could actually uh look at each step and

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,519
uh confirm that yeah this is a

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
trustworthy information so the reader

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
doesn't have to take our words for uh

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
for an investigation they can just find

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,319
the same photo or delicate the same

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
photo and

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
do the research themselves okay so yeah

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
the great

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
uh thing about open source is that it

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
provides transparency and the

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
credibility to the investigation and

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,519
yeah in an ideal world again consumer

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
the reader will be able to do the same

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
investigation

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
so open source materials what are those

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
so we have these four blocks

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,640
of open source materials categories okay

107
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
so first of all is the geospatial

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,920
defense award for uh mapping services

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
so these are the things like google maps

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,000
yandex carter which is basically yandex

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
maps stereo server plan the subscription

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
and etc so

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
uh this one is very very useful for uh

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
for many things one is of course for

115
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
geolocation so if you have a photo and

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
want to find out where exactly it was

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,919
taken or you want to verify that this

118
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
image is showing um

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,840
i don't know which is showing the

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
netherlands and not belgium and things

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
like that so in this case um

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
mapping services they help a lot another

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
thing that you can do uh is for example

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
just tracking the

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
changes so for example on googlers pro

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
so you know on google maps it will show

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
you the latest satellite imagery but on

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
google earth pro which is the app

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
you can see actually historical images

130
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,759
and then you can trace the

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
historical changes basically you can see

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
if

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
um if some construction has been made if

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
the mining project is going on if some

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
forest fire caught up and the

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
consequences could be seen on the maps

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
okay and many many different things

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
the second one is media

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
of course as i said there's a high

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
chance that media has already published

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
something about the research topic

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
you're investigating

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
and that's why we always check out

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,600
what's there so yeah these are just

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
all the different medias that are out

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
there in most of the cases how our

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
research works is that we are reading

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
some article and we see they're

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
mentioning some photo or some

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,360
interesting thing that they didn't

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
follow up on and we say oh that sounds

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
interesting for us we could probably do

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
something about it and then it's based

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
on research on it

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
the third one is user generated

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
content which is basically yeah

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
everything on social media that users

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
are posting you all perfectly know how

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
much information is out there

160
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
on youtube on linkedin on instagram tik

161
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,000
tok facebook contact and etc etc okay so

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
we use this information a lot

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
and the last one is databases and

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
archived materials so basically human

165
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
knowledge of the world this can be a

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
databases of books like google ebooks it

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,800
can be a governmental databases of

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
companies like companies house it can be

169
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
a private database of companies like

170
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
lexisnexis which costs some money uh

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
information from internet archive which

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
has an archive of millions of websites

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
but also books videos and etc

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
so those are all the uh main four

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
categories where we get our information

176
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,759
from okay and you all yeah i uh quite

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,120
used to those

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
and here are some other four categories

179
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
that we do use from time to time these

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
are called gray area open source

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
materials

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
why gray area because there's a lot of

183
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
question about ethics about them okay

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,639
not all journalists consider the sources

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,440
as open source uh some journals do some

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
journals don't because of the ethical

187
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
reasons okay

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
so for example we do use leaked material

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
so this can be information from

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
wikileaks but it can be also information

191
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
uh from uh linked passwords and linked

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
uh like linked platforms like from

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
defaced intellects

194
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,479
and etc it can be databases that we can

195
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
buy uh on yeah by basically in the

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
internet or find on turret here's an

197
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
example of um

198
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,919
database

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
of um russian airlines so russian

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
airlines uh which is called ira float a

201
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
couple years ago we had a huge lick so

202
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
you could find um

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
info about the passengers if you're

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
searching for a person you could see

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
their

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
past flights their date of birth their

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
passport information the people they

208
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
flew with so basically the people they

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
bought tickets together with okay so

210
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
this kind of information so if it if it

211
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
has been leaked we um

212
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
might use this material depending on the

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
investigation so i'll talk about uh a

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
bit about in the

215
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
next slides uh when we

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
do justifying using those because yeah

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,680
there is of course two sides of it so in

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
one case it can help us to

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
find this geru agent agent fsb agent or

220
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
like any other any other bad guy okay

221
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
but there is also another uh

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
another ethical issue is that because

223
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,479
uh some yeah because uh by buying this

224
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
information we're incentivizing of

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759
course uh

226
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
hackers to get this data to link this

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
data or uh we are supporting this yeah

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
this platform which shares uh personal

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
information of lots of people okay so

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
there's this trade-off and in each case

231
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,120
we

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
always have a

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,360
discussion if it's really worth

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
looking at this data okay so we wouldn't

235
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
just check it for some random person but

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
only when it's

237
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
it would be

238
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
in the public interest okay

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,480
next one is contact books which is apps

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
like get contact truecaller sync me has

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
anybody heard about them

242
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,920
no okay

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
some of you might i think

244
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
these are the apps that you basically

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
download it to your phone

246
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,160
and uh you give them access to your

247
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
contact book okay so when somebody else

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
so the great thing about it is if

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
somebody else that you don't know is

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,320
calling you it will tell you the name of

251
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
this person okay it can tell you right

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
away that's a scam or it can tell you

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
right here that's a bank or some uh

254
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
person's name so how this works is uh as

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
i've said when you download it you give

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
access to your contact book and when

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
there are lots of people who downloaded

258
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
it downloaded it the

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
app will have a huge contact cloud right

260
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
and then you can do searches you can

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
search for this person and then find how

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
this person has been saved in some

263
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,399
others users okay so for example let's

264
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
say that um i never downloaded this get

265
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
contact book right so i never download

266
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
it i don't have my information on it but

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
my sister for example she doesn't care

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
okay she does care about her like

269
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
contacts being linked or she might have

270
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
not read that um terms and she agreed to

271
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,360
that

272
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
so if she if she saved me as like sister

273
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,839
okay

274
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,519
then if you would search for my phone

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
number you would find that someone has

276
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,240
saved me a sister okay if she says mess

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,120
ironish uh i don't know like aranesh my

278
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
name then you would find that uh someone

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
saved miss ironic okay so this is a

280
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
great way to um

281
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
find the information about people

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
because uh because usually this uh like

283
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
bad guys or just in general like people

284
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
who don't want uh their information to

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,760
be public

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,480
they have no say on it right because if

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
my sister if my friend if my colleague

288
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
uh downloaded this

289
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
app and they had my contact then i'll my

290
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
information will be exposed there okay

291
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
so yeah this is this is sketchy things

292
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
about contact books uh and that's why

293
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,000
they're in this gray area open source

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
but we

295
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
do use them quite often again when we

296
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
have a phone number and we want to find

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,560
out who this phone number belongs to

298
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
the next one exposed databases database

299
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,839
on mysql amazon web services bio but

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
also like google sheets and stuff and

301
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
these are the databases that uh users

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
have but they um

303
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
don't really know that they made this

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
database public and then again there's

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
this ethical question

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
um that are you gonna use this

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
information uh when the user didn't

308
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
actually know that they made it public

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,040
okay

310
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
and the last one is dark web markets

311
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
uh like silk road and dream market we

312
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
don't often you don't really deal with

313
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
research there we just this is a place

314
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,800
for us to sometimes download leaked

315
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,160
databases but yeah that's pretty it

316
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
okay

317
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
so what is open source this is a source

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
that is freely available to the public

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
as i said this can include the payroll

320
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,680
but in most of the cases we do use

321
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,760
free tools okay and i'll show you uh

322
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
i'll show a few

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,480
events that we use okay and this does

324
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
not include directorying or requesting

325
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
hacking

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
uh stealing or spying

327
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,800
but it can include accessing uh publicly

328
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
available leak data okay so you're never

329
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,279
gonna like come up to a hacker and say

330
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
hey could you head this person social

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
media or hack this database

332
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
but that's what we are going to do if

333
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
some hacker has already linked it if

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,519
some organization has already elected we

335
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,200
might use this information okay

336
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
so yeah and just uh remember that when

337
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
we are doing a research uh it uh

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
yeah the results that we have will

339
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
depend on uh lots of different factors

340
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,839
if you are looking into a person it of

341
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
course will depend on how much digital

342
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
um

343
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
footprint this person live uh we will

344
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
also look uh at the platforms this

345
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,800
person is using so for example if you

346
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
are looking to contact or

347
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,040
facebook

348
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
fantastic is basically a phase rush on

349
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,399
facebook

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,839
so if you're doing a research on

351
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,279
facebook and if

352
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
you can't really go out of facebook too

353
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
many other places whereas if you're

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
researching on contacts

355
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
even if the account was closed they

356
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
would still be able to see their friends

357
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
list would still be able to find out

358
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,360
their date of birth their uh old

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
profiles uh old bios and etc just

360
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
because contact is more research

361
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
friendly and

362
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
it can't get scraped okay

363
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
the same with whatsapp and telegram so

364
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
telegram is also a messaging app similar

365
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
to whatsapp but it just has more

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
features and again it's more research

367
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
friendly and if you're

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
doing an institution based on what's up

369
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,399
it would be extremely difficult because

370
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,720
you can't really find groups uh you

371
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,839
can't really

372
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,839
find different channels and stuff but if

373
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
you found a telegram you can first of

374
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,320
all do a search on different groups even

375
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,279
on private groups on uh channels private

376
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
channels and stuff like that

377
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,639
and if you find an account you'll also

378
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
be able to find their username and

379
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
and then just continue and continue your

380
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
search okay so it really depends on what

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,920
platform they're using another thing to

382
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
remember is the

383
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
privacy uh

384
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,480
legislation uh in uh the country they're

385
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,680
residing in

386
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
so for example same

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
with russia so in russia

388
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
the government was collecting lots of

389
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
lots of information about the citizens

390
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
and uh they were intending to do this

391
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
private and they keep it to themselves

392
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
for their their use but it gets hacked

393
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
all the time and that's why you can find

394
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
a person like a russian citizens

395
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
passport information easily their flight

396
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
record their uh cars where the car is

397
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
registered the phone number uh that they

398
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
used and etcetera so lots of information

399
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
there so if you're looking to

400
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,320
like on information about kyrgyzstan

401
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,399
it's somewhere in between you can find

402
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
some information so if you were to

403
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
research me you would find my full name

404
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
uh with my paternal name would find out

405
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
my date of purse my relatives the

406
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
village i will use to live in kyrgyzstan

407
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
and things like that because this

408
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
information was made um intentionally

409
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
public okay but you can't really go uh

410
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,959
further than that uh whereas in uh

411
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,800
germany for example it's completely

412
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,079
closed off

413
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
uh because they're uh

414
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
yeah

415
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
their uh privacy and data legislation is

416
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
uh much better that i'd say so it really

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
depends on the countries you're

418
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,560
researching in okay

419
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
so yeah open source investigations

420
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
called a new genre of journalism and

421
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,639
beyond

422
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
uh again when our founder started

423
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
bellingham it was 2014 and it was quite

424
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,360
new and he was one of those pioneers and

425
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
nowadays it is really

426
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
up i'd say

427
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,800
so for example new york times has a

428
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
great visual investigations team

429
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
where they do great just investigations

430
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
in the different matters and they've won

431
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,040
a couple pulitzer prizes for it

432
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
washington post has also their visual

433
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,120
forensics team

434
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
bbc uh africa i uh has also done some

435
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,040
great investigations so here uh there

436
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,519
was uh this investigation called anatomy

437
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,680
of a killing um

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
just an amazing investigation that uh

439
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,839
bbc africa

440
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,480
so what happened uh was that there was a

441
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
facebook video circulating on the

442
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
internet with uh some soldiers executing

443
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,079
uh women and children so there was like

444
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,320
this horrific video

445
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
uh it was allegedly uh

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,120
shot in cameroon and the people the

447
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
executors were cameron soldiers okay

448
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,480
allegedly

449
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
uh but the government would deny this

450
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,320
saying this is fake news uh i don't know

451
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
this is uh from uh i don't know from a

452
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
movie or something or some other

453
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
different place so it's not uh true they

454
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,959
were basically claiming and then what if

455
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,959
bbc africa did they first of all they

456
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,560
gellocated at this place so you could

457
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,440
see

458
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,720
uh just a tiny bit uh just a

459
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
short video uh showing the soldier

460
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
walking with women and children and you

461
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,000
could see some place around like the

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
road how the roads looked what buildings

463
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,039
there were

464
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
and etc so they were able to ge allocate

465
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
it and confirm that yes this was

466
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
actually shot in cameroon

467
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,599
and then they were able also to confirm

468
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,959
that this were actually cameroon

469
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,319
soldiers

470
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,590
any guess how to do that

471
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,659
[Applause]

472
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
okay

473
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,919
yes so looking at their uniform actually

474
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
was very easy to check uh they what they

475
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
did was they just googled like cameron

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
uniform and they could see that this

477
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
matches exactly the same so they had to

478
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
be the ones and yeah as the result

479
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
of this investigation it was confirmed

480
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,559
that this video is true and their

481
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,799
children and women were executed by

482
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,120
cameron soldiers and later they were

483
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
convicted of murder okay so this is what

484
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
uh verification and uh geolocation can

485
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
lead to

486
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,160
uh this is also getting popular um

487
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
in the

488
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
non-governmental organizations in the

489
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
human rights organizations so here's for

490
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
example a vacancy for a human rights

491
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
watch for open source investigations

492
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,760
head

493
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
un also has a team of open source

494
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
investigators okay

495
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,080
again uh this is all because um

496
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
people know how much uh power uh like

497
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,919
this open sources hold uh you don't

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
have to necessarily be in the i know in

499
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
the conflict zone or be on site to do

500
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
investigations you

501
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
can sometimes do it uh just online okay

502
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
searching for relevant videos on

503
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
internet searching for relevant videos

504
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
in the local region in the local

505
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,280
language on youtube on tiktok and etc

506
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
and yeah

507
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,640
and since there's so many uh information

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
that is out there on the internet you

509
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
can apply it to a

510
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
great range of topics okay

511
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
so this can be conflict zone and

512
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,360
conflict zone usually are the ones that

513
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
get the most attention

514
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
uh they're not i wouldn't say in

515
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,000
australia that these are the most

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
popular investigations uh that are there

517
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
but uh that researchers do

518
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
but necessarily the ones that get the

519
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,039
most attention so for example uh right

520
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,280
now at bellencout we are uh

521
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,559
we have this project where we are

522
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
looking at the russian invasion of

523
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
ukraine and what we are doing is we are

524
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
basically collecting all those photos

525
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
videos posted in ukraine okay so yes you

526
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,400
know there are lots of people who are

527
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
just um taking photos of damages of

528
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
murder of different atrocities and via

529
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
balance we are collecting those we are

530
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
verifying that this uh indeed happened

531
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
in ukraine and not and also it is new

532
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
it's not from the like 10 years ago or

533
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
from another place we are also

534
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,799
delocating it confirmed yeah that yes

535
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,000
this was uh like this video was done in

536
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
eliza chance uh this uh hospital

537
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
uh was located in lisa chance this

538
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,760
number you know five schools etc in kiev

539
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,080
uh and etc okay so we are trying to

540
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,960
geolocate it and then um

541
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
we have this nice database of all these

542
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
incidents we are specifically focusing

543
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
on civilian harm than in ukraine

544
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,919
and then uh this gets transferred into a

545
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,039
nice map where people like anybody can

546
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
access it and see the cases the

547
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
incidents of civilian harm that we were

548
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,159
able to verify and gellocate and confirm

549
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,440
okay

550
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
and why is this useful this is useful

551
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
because uh the first of all like other

552
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
researchers other journalists can do

553
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,919
their investigations based on this data

554
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
the governments different justin

555
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
accountability bodies can use this

556
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
information because this has been uh

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
verified and

558
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,559
uh vetted by our staff okay

559
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
and lots of other places so for example

560
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,080
uh i'm currently looking also at the

561
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,080
protests that turn deadly in tajikistan

562
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,039
and

563
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,360
yeah my colleagues have looked at yemen

564
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,559
syria

565
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
and also many different other places

566
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
okay so this can be

567
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
applied to any country

568
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
yup the next one is environmental

569
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
research

570
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,039
again quite

571
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,080
popular i'd say uh just again using uh

572
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,039
different

573
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
mapping services you can see the changes

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
in um i don't know in the um

575
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,080
like sea level on the level of the lakes

576
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
uh you can see deforestation many

577
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
different stuff but you can also look at

578
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
the mapping services not only with the

579
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
satellite imagery but also with

580
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,200
different radars to see how the moisture

581
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
index has changed how the vegetation

582
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
index has changed and etc okay

583
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
and lots of other different things

584
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,480
basically again looking for photos for

585
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
videos posted on youtube

586
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
facebook and etc

587
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
then there is corruption and financial

588
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
research

589
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
i've done

590
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
i've done a few investigations to

591
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
corrupt corruption in central asia and

592
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,520
these are the cases uh for example in my

593
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
case it was the fact that there was this

594
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
very very um uh well then influential

595
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
corrupt family but no one could prove

596
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
that they were corrupt right

597
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,080
and uh what we were able to do is uh

598
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,840
find their instagram accounts and the

599
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,280
kleistenke accounts which is like

600
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
basically again russian facebook of uh

601
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,880
their family members and um

602
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
we could see that they have uh they're

603
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
having this luxurious lifestyle that

604
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
they would not be able to afford on

605
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
their

606
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,799
government salary were they also able to

607
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
find their nanny of this of this

608
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,440
particular family who was posting uh

609
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
photos with private jets with the kids

610
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
of this family who was

611
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,559
doing a whole video tour of their new

612
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
apartment in dubai uh a whole 10 minutes

613
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
of saying like my bosses have just

614
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
bought this apartment and we could see

615
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
from their wife's instagram account that

616
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
this is your apartment because she

617
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
posted videos the walls were the same

618
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
the doors were the same and like

619
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
different um

620
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
different furniture

621
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
and then we could confirm that uh like

622
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
when this nani posted a photo from here

623
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,480
uh from this uh like penthouse window we

624
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
could geolocate it we could find a

625
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
dislocated in there

626
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,720
in the uh most expensive area of dubai

627
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,640
uh in in

628
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,760
this building and it was a penthouse and

629
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,080
uh this costs a few million dollars and

630
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
again this family was making around ten

631
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
thousand dollars a year on uh their

632
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,480
governmental job being the

633
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
head of uh

634
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
texas um

635
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
in kyrgyzstan and there was no way they

636
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
were able to afford it so this came as a

637
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,200
crucial evidence

638
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
yeah crucial evidence to actually

639
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,159
prove that

640
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,279
they are corrupt and then later they

641
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,400
had to

642
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120
confirm it and they uh yeah he was

643
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
basically arrested okay

644
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,760
there are also things like hr criminal

645
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
or person focused research of course and

646
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
historical research and the fun fact is

647
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,440
librarians actually the first open uh uh

648
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
source investigators because they used

649
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
the

650
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
information that was publicly available

651
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
so yeah and lots of also other different

652
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,679
things okay it's just the ones that are

653
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,760
uh more popular

654
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,679
right now

655
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,720
so yeah and what is balanced um

656
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
how many of you

657
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,039
have heard about balance before

658
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,840
okay okay i'll skip this one

659
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
so yeah we have our website we publish

660
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,039
in english russian and ukrainian some

661
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
articles get translated

662
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
some of the most

663
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
popular ones are our investigations in

664
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,559
syria

665
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,039
so ella higgins our founder he started

666
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
actually with syria in his free time he

667
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
would just

668
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,960
research what's going on there it was

669
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,679
like during 2013 2014 because it was it

670
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,360
was very difficult to find information

671
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
about the syrian war because it was uh

672
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
for journalists it was very risky to go

673
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,480
there

674
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,600
and what he figured that he can actually

675
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,919
like find videos uh what's going on

676
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,080
there in arabic because local people

677
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
were also posting photos and videos of

678
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,760
what's happening and uh journalists uh

679
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
just didn't know how to find it and he

680
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,840
was just yeah basically searching uh the

681
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,400
same terms in arabic he would able he

682
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,679
was able to find videos he would

683
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,400
gellocate them and confirm that yeah

684
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
here are chemical weapons being used and

685
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
stuff like that so he had actually no

686
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
background in anything like that he

687
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
never had a yeah he never knew how to

688
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
differentiate uh among different weapons

689
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,279
but then he just by

690
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,320
googling

691
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
he became an expert at the end okay

692
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,559
uh there is mh17 the downing of the

693
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
malaysian bank over ukraine in 2014.

694
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,480
again when this one happened

695
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
no one really knew what was going on

696
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
russia was blaming ukraine ukraine was

697
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
blaming russia

698
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,679
and

699
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,000
and no one knew who was responsible for

700
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
killing almost 300 people

701
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,200
and

702
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
what we decided to do at that point is

703
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,919
again turn to social media

704
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,559
so you all know that the

705
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,480
buoyant cannot be shot by just a random

706
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,440
weapon it has to be a missile launcher

707
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
right a rocket system some uh so and

708
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
there are not that many uh uh like

709
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,159
missile launchers in ukraine and russia

710
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
and we suspected that if there was uh a

711
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
missile launch for traveling it would be

712
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,919
with a convoy uh with a military convoy

713
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,520
and some people would of course see it

714
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
some like uh citizens would

715
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
would be able to see it and then upload

716
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
it to the internet so you started just

717
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,600
searching on youtube on local social

718
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,679
medias for a keyword military convoy

719
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,520
and then we started finding photos and

720
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
videos that people were actually seeing

721
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,720
it a few days a couple of weeks before

722
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,520
the

723
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
downloading of the brain and then we

724
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
were able to delocate those and then

725
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,480
make this map so this mr launcher was

726
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,200
spotted in russia going to the border at

727
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
this point of time then a couple days

728
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,320
later it was spotted in ukraine at this

729
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,240
place at this point of time and then we

730
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,679
could see that sexual travels from

731
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,000
russia and after the downing we could

732
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
again find the photos and videos of this

733
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
missile launcher of the book

734
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
and when it was going back we could see

735
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,000
it was missing one missile okay and yeah

736
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
this is uh this is just an example of

737
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
how we looked at it we also looked at

738
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,600
the

739
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,559
uh

740
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,120
military unions that were near uh

741
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,600
ukraine okay so one of the closest would

742
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
be a kursk which is in russia and then

743
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
we uh started searching for uh

744
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
uh four uh

745
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,279
soldiers who worked at this court's

746
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,840
military unit because same is uh

747
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
facebook like people

748
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,480
oh like these people are like 19 20 21

749
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
they would of course indicate in their

750
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,320
bios on their social medias that they

751
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,799
work at this military unit and then we

752
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
would find their social medias we would

753
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,480
find that they were actually taking

754
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,399
photos with a book they were in this

755
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,720
convoy posting photos because for them

756
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
it was uh it was quite exciting it was

757
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,279
uh probably again they're like in the

758
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,320
area

759
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
they're 90 and they're 20 they must have

760
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
been their first trip so they have

761
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
uploaded lots of pictures on social

762
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,880
media and it was 2014 they had no idea

763
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,760
that uh this info could be used okay

764
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
so yeah then we have skripal and navalny

765
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
poisonings um

766
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
where we've actually used

767
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,200
quite a few of this gray area

768
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
gray area

769
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
sources

770
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
so

771
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,760
there was a yeah poisoning of skripals

772
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,320
and navalny by navy navichok

773
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,159
and

774
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,480
yeah again in both of the cases it was

775
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
not really clear what happened so what

776
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,679
we did we

777
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,720
used

778
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
this gray open source area so leaked

779
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,679
databases if we had the name we would

780
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,679
search for this name and see if this

781
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
name has um

782
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,320
any

783
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,399
uh car registered to it uh passport

784
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
information and etc

785
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
uh we would find different flight

786
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
records of these people so

787
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
for the uh i think it was for a novel

788
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,840
investigation uh we were searching for

789
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,399
people who were traveling uh

790
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
with him okay on the same route and we

791
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
eventually found some people that turned

792
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
out to be traveling with him for a few

793
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
years so they were tracing him

794
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
and then uh yeah we could find their

795
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
passport in for their full name

796
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,559
uh their phone number and then we'll go

797
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,279
to those contact books like get contact

798
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,000
through caller and searching for this

799
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
phone number we could see that uh

800
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,919
so this is a telegram bot okay which is

801
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,480
basically works on get contact and we

802
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
uploaded a phone number and we would

803
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,080
tell us tell us how this phone number

804
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
was saved

805
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,480
again this was a phone number of um

806
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,840
of a agent probably and then he for sure

807
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,240
did not have this app uh downloaded but

808
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,679
some of his friends did some of his

809
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,480
family members did and they uh saved him

810
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,720
as vladimir

811
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,320
okay so these things happen a lot okay

812
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
saying like this fsb because people

813
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,960
usually say them as like where they know

814
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
them from right

815
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,880
and then we look at their phone records

816
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
with this novel investigation since we

817
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,640
had a phone number we went a little step

818
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,919
further

819
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,919
so in russia uh

820
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,880
you might know there's a lot of

821
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
corruption going on same in kyrgyzstan

822
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,559
and in both of these countries you can

823
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,879
actually

824
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,200
find different uh

825
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,559
websites

826
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,200
of the workers from mobile operators

827
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,559
okay they work for those mobile

828
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,720
operators and they'll get you their

829
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,440
phone record of a phone number that

830
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,919
you're looking for okay so we requested

831
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,919
this information that did cost us some

832
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,320
money but we could find out like all the

833
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,880
phone numbers this phone number called

834
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,039
and of course it would be like other

835
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
high ranking fsb officials there would

836
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
be a commander and stuff like that but

837
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
we also could see their location okay

838
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
where this uh was

839
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
where the the person was when doing a

840
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,039
call when the phone was done

841
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,960
and yeah you should remember that this

842
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,279
is uh like fsb agents they're also

843
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,760
people they do mistakes uh some dumb of

844
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
them so for example

845
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
they have this rule they are not

846
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,480
supposed to turn on their phone wearing

847
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,240
on a mission because they can get

848
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
tracked and what they did

849
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,399
actually was when they were near the

850
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,960
hotel of navalny uh they actually turned

851
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,720
on their phone for three seconds and

852
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
this three seconds were enough to get

853
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
the location from the mobile operator

854
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
and since we bought this data we could

855
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,279
also find it

856
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
okay

857
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
so let's do a quick example

858
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,480
uh

859
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,799
which is called locating ic supporters

860
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,000
2016 you might remember there was a huge

861
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
campaign by isis supporters taking

862
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,519
photos and saying that they are actually

863
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,320
uh they live in europe they're uh in

864
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,200
this city and they're actually among

865
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,080
yeah

866
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,679
and they're not basically they're not

867
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,480
far away but uh in munster for example

868
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,240
in paris to spread terror okay so what

869
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,039
you would find is uh this kind of photo

870
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,360
uh posted on twitter and this one says

871
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,720
like isis supporter uh like germany

872
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,399
munster okay

873
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,159
and lots of isis supporters would do

874
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,799
that to spread fear that again these ice

875
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,519
supporters are not somewhere uh far away

876
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,039
but uh here in their cities okay and the

877
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,320
open source community started

878
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
gellocating it

879
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,399
and let's do it together so please uh

880
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,360
yeah just shout out a place that

881
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,720
shout out

882
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
uh the details you see that can help you

883
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,159
find out where exactly this is

884
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,279
yep it is mr yes

885
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,080

886
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,880
could you please repeat the question

887
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,840
oh yeah sure uh so we want to find out

888
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,320
where exactly this photo was taken so

889
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
what are the details that will help you

890
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,279
we have a uh first answer saying the bus

891
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,679
yeah you can actually just google mr bus

892
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,640
and find out that mr has similar buses

893
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
we cannot see really the number okay

894
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,200
because it was uploaded on twitter so

895
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,240
the route we didn't film now

896
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,200
yeah there is a poster and this is also

897
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,640
very important

898
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
uh we couldn't really find figure out

899
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
what was written there and what

900
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
advertisement it was but then it got

901
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
very useful okay

902
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
yeah

903
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
yes

904
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
yeah so now we're looking at the micro

905
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,519
details so uh if you find some similar

906
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,120
place the details you would cross

907
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
reference okay to make sure this is the

908
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
right place so yeah there's the white

909
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,720
building in behind what else

910
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,320
uh-huh you can see the trees you can see

911
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
the lights i've heard yeah you can see

912
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,119
that there is one light there

913
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,359
two of them yes there is also a big

914
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,440
shadow okay

915
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,320
what do you think of this

916
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
it might be bridge it might be a

917
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,159
building

918
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,639
but there we'll go back to it later but

919
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
if you look at this place

920
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,560
it will give you a hint what this is

921
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,879
okay

922
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,159
so yeah

923
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,280
we could see also the crosswalk

924
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
okay the crosswalk here a few trees here

925
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
and yeah these are the things so we

926
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
couldn't figure out where this

927
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,918
place is so what we did we posted on

928
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
twitter saying hey does anybody

929
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
recognize this place as there is then

930
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
you want to know how to find this place

931
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
and then this german resident tells us

932
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,640
on twitter just replies saying actually

933
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
in germany

934
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,000
there is a map with all uh advertisement

935
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
stands okay

936
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,599
and then you can find it

937
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
so we went to this website

938
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,760
you can see there were just a hundreds

939
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,040
of these advertisements columns so

940
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
we do we go to google maps to do a

941
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,560
satellite imagery and then we start uh

942
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,119
filtering the ones that uh could be okay

943
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,720
now i'm gonna give you six uh options

944
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,480
okay and you'll tell me which one is

945
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,280
right

946
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,240
okay

947
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,119
now look again at the details in this

948
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
photo

949
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,040
what do those lights tell you

950
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
yes there is a crossing yeah there is an

951
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
intersection in there

952
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,920
okay

953
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,640
so look at all the details

954
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
okay let's go

955
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,839
the first one

956
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,599
do you think it is the right place

957
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,079
why not

958
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,240
yes no crossing by the way this uh green

959
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,400
thing means this is where the adverse ed

960
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,640
was okay the column what about this one

961
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
okay i'm hearing i know let's look on

962
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,720
the third one

963
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,839
oh it might be two lies for you yeah

964
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
i'm sorry

965
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,960
yes there is no white building across

966
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,040
the street that's right

967
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,400
okay

968
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
what about the fourth one

969
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,480
oh i'm sorry nothing everyone can see it

970
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
i think

971
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,359
oh perfect

972
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,119
that makes sense yeah what do you think

973
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,760
about this one

974
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,839
okay i'm seeing i'm hearing maybes

975
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,160
okay

976
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,160
number five

977
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,078
what's that

978
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,200
yeah yeah

979
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
it's not round about because they don't

980
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,800
have lights that's good

981
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,599
and the last one

982
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,240
okay who thinks it's the number one

983
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,720
number two

984
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
okay i've got one

985
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,078
maybe number three

986
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,920
number four

987
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,640
okay let's look at number four then

988
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,839
so now now we're gonna zoom in okay and

989
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,280
now we are gonna look at the micro

990
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,160
details okay on the small details uh

991
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
that match

992
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,480
so what do you see matching

993
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,720
yeah i can hear traffic lights

994
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,520
so

995
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
here's one traffic light

996
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,680
the yeah and then here's the another one

997
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,520
and you can see it's also

998
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
the shape okay

999
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,880
this

1000
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,040
yeah so here here's the shape you can

1001
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
see it's not straight it's curved and

1002
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,800
here's the same anything else

1003
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,359
i'm sorry

1004
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,279
four legs

1005
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
oh

1006
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
that might be tricky

1007
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
because uh this is satellite imagery

1008
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
from google and it was taken i think a

1009
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,560
few years before this took place okay

1010
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
so yeah unfortunately maybe you can do

1011
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,640
it but we cannot access the satellites

1012
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,560
that are doing it the exact time okay

1013
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,060
so uh yeah

1014
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,960
[Music]

1015
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,680
yes the uh yeah the lines so you can see

1016
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
there's one thick line here the same as

1017
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,200
here i'm not sure if you're able to see

1018
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,359
it here but there's also another one uh

1019
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,440
dashed the thinner one and you can see

1020
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,760
it here too

1021
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
yep

1022
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
you can see uh also

1023
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,119
this barrier you might think it's a

1024
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,599
shadow it's actually a barrier

1025
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,160
and then we have a question about the

1026
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
shadow does anyone have a guess

1027
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
what the shadow means

1028
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
this huge shadow huh

1029
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,480
direction of what

1030
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,320
yeah yeah why is it so huge

1031
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
yes that's right

1032
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,760
so uh the this photo was uploaded around

1033
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,880
seven a.m eight a.m and the shadow is

1034
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
much

1035
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,000
longer than this in this google photo so

1036
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,480
the satellite images are usually taken

1037
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,119
at noon at some time close to noon to

1038
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
get the list amount of shadow

1039
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
okay

1040
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
so here's just

1041
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,640
an example that you can also track

1042
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
different projects

1043
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,880
okay

1044
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,340
and

1045
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,469
[Music]

1046
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,040
and yeah now we're gonna do

1047
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,200
another stage but just give me a second

1048
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,279
we are finishing at 12 right

1049
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:00,800
now

1050
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,839
but

1051
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,560
it's

1052
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,560
11 15. oh okay so i was so i thought

1053
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,599
okay let me give you another example

1054
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,960
about the overflowing of information so

1055
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,599
open source investigations are not

1056
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,440
black magic okay so we can only find

1057
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
what's there out in the internet uh but

1058
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
it also has its own challenges so one

1059
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
challenge is that you cannot find that

1060
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
information that you need

1061
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,839
meaning that there are there's just so

1062
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,200
little information about this first

1063
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,440
scenario about this event another is the

1064
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
opposite having just this huge amount of

1065
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,359
information okay

1066
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,760
so here's an example

1067
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
2017

1068
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,000
this white supremacist protests in

1069
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,480
charlottesville in the u.s

1070
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
a photo gets posted

1071
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,599
saying that

1072
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,880
three this

1073
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,480
three white dudes

1074
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,640
beat up a black kid and then this black

1075
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,839
kid uh yeah ended up in a hospital

1076
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,240
uh with lots of injuries

1077
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,400
and we wanted to find out who this

1078
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,079
person is

1079
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,440
okay so all we have is this one blurry

1080
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,280
picture and we know that this is a

1081
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
charlottesville event

1082
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,920
uh in august 2017.

1083
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,599
so how do you think we can find this

1084
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,839
person what would your be your first

1085
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,000
step

1086
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,839
yeah i can see the helmet here and there

1087
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,520
so you can see this he's wearing a

1088
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,400
helmet white helmet if you feel closer

1089
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,880
you'll also see that he has stickers

1090
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,839
black and red that makes it quite unique

1091
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,599
okay that's good so you know how to

1092
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,839
differentiate him from other people

1093
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,160
yeah maybe look at twitter for pictures

1094
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,280
of the same process

1095
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,680
better yeah exactly that's exactly what

1096
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
we did we

1097
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,040
started looking for other photos and

1098
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,680
videos published about this event uh we

1099
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,280
did like hashtag charlotte as well on

1100
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,359
twitter on facebook but we also just

1101
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,839
googled and tried to find out as many

1102
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,319
photos and videos as possible

1103
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,520
okay

1104
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
so eventually

1105
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,680
uh eric was able to he yeah he looked

1106
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,599
through a thousand of images and he

1107
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,960
eventually was able to find uh this uh

1108
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,319
this guy

1109
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,280
do you think it's the same person

1110
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
could be

1111
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,359
why is that

1112
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,720
yeah shirt is the same i'm hearing

1113
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,119
yeah stickers also match i'm here yeah

1114
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,680
so the shirt matches uh and the stickers

1115
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
also match okay so you can see there's

1116
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,879
uh this black sticker

1117
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,359
but also red sticker and also if you

1118
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,480
zoom in you'll be able to see that

1119
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
there's something written in here and

1120
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
you yeah and this one's also much saying

1121
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,240
something killer maybe yeah something

1122
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,599
like this

1123
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,720
and yeah

1124
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,599
but again so now we found uh a couple of

1125
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,920
uh images of him where we can see his

1126
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,880
face

1127
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,280
but again on this images there was no

1128
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,480
text no usernames no names etc

1129
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,960
so what we do is

1130
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
we just continue searching for this

1131
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,040
person and then eventually we find this

1132
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,079
guy so i'm pretty sure that uh some of

1133
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,359
you would suggest doing a facial

1134
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,520
recognition but this one was back in

1135
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,760
2017 and facial recognition in this case

1136
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
did not help but nowadays i'm pretty

1137
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,079
sure you would be able to find something

1138
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
so then we find this guy

1139
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
do you think it's the same person

1140
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
yes because of the burst marks that's

1141
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,599
right so yeah the birthmarks are the

1142
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,319
same and he's also wearing a chain

1143
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,440
and uh yeah if you look at his ear it

1144
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,240
also has the same form okay

1145
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,560
but again we we found another picture of

1146
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,960
him but we didn't know who he is so the

1147
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,599
next step for us would be searching for

1148
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,800
his friends okay do the exact same

1149
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,880
the exact same thing because we could

1150
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,520
see in the photos that he was always

1151
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,920
with these guys so we assume that others

1152
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
are his friends and we find if we find

1153
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,599
information on them then we might find

1154
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,160
information about them

1155
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,079
so we do the same thing and then we find

1156
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,640
this twitter account called yes your

1157
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
racist basically exposing all these

1158
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,119
white supremacists on the protest okay

1159
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,880
so they posted this photo and

1160
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,880
screenshots from facebook accounts of

1161
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,560
these guys

1162
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,280
so we go to their profiles being

1163
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680
fine we find jacob dicks

1164
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
you can see that the same guy we can see

1165
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
ryan martin do you think these are the

1166
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
same people

1167
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,680
why is that

1168
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
yes tattoos okay so here we're 100 sure

1169
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
that this is the same guy

1170
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,040
we look at their friends list and then

1171
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,800
we can see that jacob dick's the blonde

1172
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,359
guy is friend with ryan martin

1173
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,119
and then we just go through his friends

1174
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,920
list because we expect that uh that's uh

1175
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,480
the the first person to be his friend

1176
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,680
and we find this dan book boredom

1177
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,240
here's the guy

1178
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,000
we can see that he's friends with jacob

1179
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,960
dicks

1180
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,040
and ryan martian

1181
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,359
and then here are photos of him

1182
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,200
okay do you think it's the same guy

1183
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
yeah there is marks so you can see that

1184
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,520
he has the same birthmarks he's wearing

1185
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,079
the same chain

1186
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,160
and yeah if you again look at the ears

1187
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
it will be the same

1188
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
yeah

1189
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,040
yeah and uh this is how uh just by uh

1190
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,800
sitting at computer eric i think it took

1191
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,920
him around two weeks maybe he was able

1192
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,720
to go from this blurry photo to actually

1193
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,400
uh the name of this guy okay

1194
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
and then about two months after the

1195
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240
investigation the

1196
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,720
guy danielle bar boyden was arrested and

1197
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
found guilty okay

1198
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,040
yeah

1199
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,319
um

1200
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
okay

1201
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,319
so other challenges is that ethical

1202
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,560
concerns okay that i've told you about

1203
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,400
where do you draw the line on gathering

1204
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,640
personal information on someone so

1205
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
for example if you're looking

1206
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
uh if you're looking into neo-nazi

1207
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,119
groups uh really do you think it's okay

1208
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,160
to create a fake profile uh

1209
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,119
with some uh other events like photos

1210
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,720
and pretend they're also what's the

1211
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,560
premise to get into this group and then

1212
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,319
infiltrate then check out all the data

1213
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,119
okay

1214
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
you might find it's okay you might find

1215
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
it's not okay or if you're looking at

1216
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,839
this um i don't know what this person

1217
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,680
are you going to create a fake profile

1218
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,240
of their friends to friend them and then

1219
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,680
once you get access to the information

1220
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,319
deleted immediately again i think most

1221
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,079
of the people would say no but still

1222
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,160
some journalists would do okay so it

1223
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,400
really depends on the line where you

1224
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,280
draw

1225
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,040
where you draw as a researcher as an

1226
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,960
organization and of course depending on

1227
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,680
the

1228
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,480
law of the country

1229
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,359
okay

1230
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,359
and yeah if you're interested in this

1231
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,400
open source investigations you can

1232
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,240
look at our tools

1233
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,520
we have our

1234
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,000
toolkit at this link because by the way

1235
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,359
i'm going to send you

1236
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,200
uh that i'm going to send the prestige

1237
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,960
to organizers here so you can get it

1238
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,920
okay

1239
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
and also there is a great book of

1240
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
michael versus open source intelligence

1241
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
techniques it's very thick and basically

1242
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
has everything um yeah everything that

1243
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,040
uh research would need

1244
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,200
so yeah sorry we're a little bit late

1245
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,078
for questions

1246
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,280
yeah thanks i just checked the program

1247
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,559
and i think the next one up is at one

1248
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,599
um

1249
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,240
so um i think we have some time for

1250
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,520
questions

1251
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,160
yeah let's just let's just use

1252
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,760
yeah so okay thank you for your

1253
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,480
presentation i wonder how many languages

1254
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,880
do you master and how do you approach

1255
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,839
languages that you don't speak or can

1256
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,079
read

1257
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,440
i'd say

1258
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,960
some of us speak only one language

1259
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,480
english i personally speak three

1260
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,559
languages and truly defense

1261
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,640
what we use is google translate okay

1262
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,880
basically so uh

1263
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,559
the team that works on ukrainian

1264
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,119
research like uh i think

1265
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,960
uh most of the team of course they don't

1266
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,880
speak ukrainian or russian we have a new

1267
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,119
ukraine researcher but still majority of

1268
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,440
us are just translating it from google

1269
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,680
translate yeah

1270
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,200
so that's the thing

1271
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,000
um

1272
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,680
so first of all thank you for your work

1273
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
giving us some

1274
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,800
proper journalism to read

1275
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
so two quick questions first of all

1276
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,240
how do you deal with um uh i guess uh

1277
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,800
individual and organizational uh

1278
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,440
security and privacy and secondly how do

1279
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,839
you deal with organizations individuals

1280
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,559
intelligence whatever that are

1281
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,720
basically pretending to be an adversary

1282
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,640
like planting evidence creating videos

1283
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,800
uploading them that are pretty like damn

1284
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,079
realistic

1285
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,280
how do you like yeah sure good question

1286
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
uh for our security yeah we take it very

1287
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,920
seriously because we always get phishing

1288
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,800
attacks from uh yeah different people

1289
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,960
especially from the russian government

1290
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,000
and for that one we have our

1291
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
first of all we have our security uh

1292
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,680
person

1293
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,000
and we follow their protocol so one of

1294
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,119
the thing is uh having the perfect cyber

1295
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,880
uh having our digital security very very

1296
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,119
well maintained uh not clicking the

1297
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,760
links uh not having the same password so

1298
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
the very basic stuff but also for the

1299
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,000
physical security i'd say there's only

1300
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,160
one not visiting russia

1301
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,640
uh for uh like smearing campaigns

1302
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,480
sometimes it does happen uh in this case

1303
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,280
uh we do uh have a

1304
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,680
trauma risk management policy where if a

1305
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,440
person is getting harassed or something

1306
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,280
like that they first of all can uh

1307
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,359
approach to a psychologist but we also

1308
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,000
have editors and

1309
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
uh yeah and basically the management

1310
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,040
staff who uh can make a statement or who

1311
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,800
can take care of it or who can decide

1312
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,119
that it's better not to uh reply to this

1313
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,040
twitter user for example that's that's

1314
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
very question

1315
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,399
oh okay

1316
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
um one question is enough the other two

1317
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,599
you can ask later after will thank you

1318
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,599
i'll be here okay

1319
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,119
because i this will be the final

1320
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,480
question because there are people

1321
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,680
standing on their legs for an hour

1322
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,760
already and i think we really need to

1323
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,119
wrap this up if that's okay go ahead

1324
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,280
hi i was wondering if you are estimating

1325
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,000
the uniqueness of let's say the stickers

1326
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,720
on the helmet and the the birthmarks

1327
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,319
because uh there might be some

1328
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,160
collisions at some point

1329
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,760
say it again sorry

1330
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,359
there might be some collisions with

1331
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,920
other people having similar bird marks

1332
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,599
or similar stickers

1333
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,760
do you estimate that yeah yeah

1334
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,200
so what we can do so first of all we

1335
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,119
look very closely at the burst marks

1336
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
they're actually hit around 10 and they

1337
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
was perfectly aligned so in this case

1338
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,800
we're like 100 for sure that the same

1339
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,119
guy but if a person doesn't really have

1340
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,720
this like birth mark or a tattoo that

1341
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,079
