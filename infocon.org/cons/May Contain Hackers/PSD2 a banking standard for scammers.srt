my

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
and welcome to psd2 a banking standard

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
for scammers with a question mark

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
because that's what we're trying to find

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,519
out

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,800
um

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
i won't be giving a presentation today

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,279
because that's usually not what i do but

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,200
i will tell you a story

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
and with this story i'm going to take

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,640
you on an epic journey from holland here

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
to belgium

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
to our capital of europe

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,160
to

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,879
portugal and all the way back to latvia

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,960
so i think that's pretty interesting

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
let me start by telling you a little bit

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
about me

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,879
i have a background in electrical

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
engineering that's what i studied

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
and

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
in 2002 i founded my company cloud aware

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
and i'm a technical consultant and now

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,760
everyone always asks me so what is it

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
that you do

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,799
and that's a difficult question because

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
in the word cloud next to my name you

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,520
can see it's quite a lot

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
so what i usually say is i go to mostly

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,759
non-technical companies and i help them

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,360
with their technical questions

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
about 10 years ago i also

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
started working with

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,360
voip services

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
and

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
i think as far as i know and please do

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
correct me later if

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
you know that i'm wrong

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
as far as i know i'm the only telco in

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
europe that is providing emergency

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,560
services 112

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
in every member state in europe

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,100
um

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,079
[Music]

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,680
if you want to talk to me later after

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
the talk you can find me in the in the

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
swiss village here at may containers

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
all right um so

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
a while i was working for a customer and

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,399
the customer

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
wanted the psd2 project

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
um so i started working on that and

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
while i was working for that i thought

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
okay what is it exactly well psd2 is a

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
payment service directive it's active

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
since 2019

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
and for those who are in a familiar or

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
outside of the eu

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
a directive is a document that is

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
crafted in brussels by the

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
european commission

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
and that document has to be implemented

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
in law in every different member state

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
in europe

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
that is very important it is implemented

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
in every member state in europe i'll get

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
to that later

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
um

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
it is uh it is mainly

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
used

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
it's meant to

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
drive innovation

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
because in the old days you needed to be

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
a bank to in order to provide financial

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
services

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
and

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,680
now you can also register yourself

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
as a payment institution

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,319
and a payment institution is not someone

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,360
who's a bank or a credit card company

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,159
but

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
it still has very strict capital and

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,239
risk management requirements and i'll

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
definitely get back to that later

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
because that's very important in this

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
talk

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,519
so let me focus a little bit on how

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
holland does this because that's where

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
i'm from and i know the most of it in

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
holland the body that regulates this is

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
called the netherlands bank the dutch

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
national bank

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,840
i'll just call it for now dnb because

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
that's that's less dutch and more

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
international

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,720
and the dnb

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
says okay so first you have to draft all

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
these documents you know proof stuff and

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
provide information to us and then we're

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
going to make a decision about it and

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
the decision is going to take minimum

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,319
three or three months so okay that's

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
quite some time but okay it's it's still

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
doable

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
the price they didn't want to be too

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
specific about it

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
but i do understand from people in the

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,959
industry that it is you can buy a really

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,519
nice car from it and a really nice car

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,560
so

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
yeah it's not cheap to get a psd2

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,919
license in holland

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
and then there's a document and the

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
document request says which requirements

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,960
do you have if you want to

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
have a psd2 license in holland and the

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
document is eight pages long

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
and it is basically just refers to to

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,960
law

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
so it is very very extensive and i just

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
picked four out of them because

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
otherwise we wouldn't have enough in 30

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,160
minutes here

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
let me have a look at the first one it's

126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,759
article 3.9 from the veto financial 26

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
so the law that governs

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
financial

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
institutions

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
and it says you need to have a reliable

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
decision maker in other words if you

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
have a criminal record or something like

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
that you cannot be a board member of the

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,759
company that wants a psd2 license

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
okay that makes sense you know you don't

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
want for example scammers

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
to have a banking license

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
you have to register everything in

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,639
procedures

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,440
that

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
well everyone who has a iso

142
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
certification knows how difficult that

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
can be

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
so the three months

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
is definitely a minimum it probably

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
takes a lot longer to get one of these

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
licenses in holland

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
i know one very interesting one

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,160
all your employees have to take an oath

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
and yeah i was a bit

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
interested in that

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
so i'm not sure what the oath says

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,759
but it specifically said that all your

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
employees have to take an oath if you

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,840
want to have this

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,960
license never seen that before

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
the article 1117 was also interesting

158
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
that basically says that

159
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,960
you have reasonable wages

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,199
and it doesn't state that but i'm

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
guessing it's not a low end of the wages

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
but it's probably board members who

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
cannot make three or four times more

164
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
than the whole revenue of a year for

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
this company

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
which also makes sense because you don't

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
want specific

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
people to withdraw all the money from

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
that uh

170
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
company and then go bankrupt or

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
something like that creates huge

172
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
problems you want to have trust in

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
financial institutions

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
so actually

175
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,720
this is a very good idea this is how you

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
would want to do it

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
don't make it too easy but do create

178
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,840
options for fintechs to create financial

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
products

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
so then i thought

181
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
yeah that's that's a lot of work

182
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
can it be done easier

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
um

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,880
and then i thought of of a different law

185
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,580
and um

186
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,039
[Music]

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
i thought of lisbon

188
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
and lisbon is a it's nice city you know

189
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,360
nice people good food

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
and good wine and

191
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
better weather than holland

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
but listen but has something else

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
it has the lisbon treaty and

194
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
specifically article 56 of the lisbon

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
treaty

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
and this article

197
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
says

198
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,639
that

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
and i'll just read this

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
within the framework restrictions on

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,080
freedom to provide services within the

202
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
union shall be prohibited in respect of

203
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
nationals of member states or

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
established a member state other than

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
that of the person of whom the service

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
are intended in other words i can buy

207
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
this service anywhere in the europe the

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
european union

209
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
and maybe there's a different member

210
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
state

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
where

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
these psd2 rules are less strict

213
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
that would be nice

214
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
so i started looking

215
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
and i promise you we're going on a

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
journey today so let's go to

217
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
latvia

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
and latvia is a member of the european

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,400
union and they therefore they provide

220
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
psd2 services

221
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
and i found a reseller of psd suit two

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,680
services

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
so i went to this reseller and i said uh

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
this sounds interesting this is exactly

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,199
what i want

226
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
so um

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
how can i you know

228
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
become a customer of yours and i said oh

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759

230
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,360

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
you're good to go

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,840
that sounds fantastic is it so

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
how much does it cost and i was thinking

234
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
about this nice car right

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
and they were like um let's see do you

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
need more data with that so do you want

237
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
to know for specific data if it was a

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,040
transaction for a supermarket or

239
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
something like that

240
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
and i was like no no i said i just want

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
to raw data itself and i said oh that's

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,839
fine then it's free

243
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,880
i was like

244
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
oh

245
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
interesting

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
so um

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,959
so basically i went from you know big

248
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
six figures plus a lot of work to

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
five minutes of work and zero euro

250
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
so okay fantastic so um then i thought

251
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
so i have this capability now and um

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
i should test it

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
you know and so i called up my my friend

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
bob there you go

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
and i said bob

256
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
you know um can i try to hack your bank

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,959
account

258
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,000
and uh well bob is an is a nice guy he's

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
smart and this is the person who would

260
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
never click on a scamming or phishing

261
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
link

262
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
so uh so i thought it will be difficult

263
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
but you know everyone have has

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
everything online so i checked out his

265
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,519
linkedin i checked out his social media

266
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
and i have a lot of information about

267
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
him i know his address i know his date

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,839
of birth full name where he works

269
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,480
everything so i was like interesting

270
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
so let's create an email where i say

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
don't fail

272
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
out any information because that's what

273
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
scammers do don't do that but this is

274
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
the information we have about you can

275
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
you please confirm this

276
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,640
um

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
and i thought it's a long shot you know

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
you will never do this and it was a few

279
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
weeks after i talked to him so he was

280
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
probably off already forgot it so i

281
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,120
thought he will never click on it and

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
yeah i was wrong

283
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,839
um

284
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
you don't have to read this but this is

285
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
the raw data that i got from his bank

286
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,040
account i literally got

287
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
all his bank accounts

288
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
all his uh

289
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
how much money was in the bank accounts

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
and literally every transaction of the

291
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
past year

292
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
of of his bank account

293
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
and just go i'll go over a few of them

294
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
um because well it's difficult to see

295
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
but you'll probably have to check it out

296
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
later on the

297
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
on the streams

298
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,480
the storage streams online but

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
there are

300
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
some interesting information in there

301
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,120
for example i know that he is going to

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
albatein every day between seven and

303
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
eight

304
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
so you're like so why this is important

305
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,640
well you know

306
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
you can't imagine that for some people

307
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
this could be a security issue

308
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,120
i don't know

309
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
ministers stuff like that you know um so

310
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
for some people you don't want to have a

311
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
specific pattern known and you can

312
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
actually get that from this data

313
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
but you can also see that he has spotify

314
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
and netflix so i'll definitely

315
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
definitely have to ask him about that

316
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,680
that's good um

317
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
there's also a lot of order data in

318
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,760
there so i can actually see that he uh

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
ordered from bold.com which is a dutch

320
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
amazon basically with the order number

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,000
and everything

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
and i can also see his um

323
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,959
what um

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
um

325
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,560
uh

326
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
yeah i can actually see his address

327
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,760
because he paid for his water bill and

328
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
the water bill actually was transferred

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
the amount of money with the complete

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,959
address and everything in it so i know

331
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,120
how much water he uses and where he

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
lives and everything i already knew that

333
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
of course because you know i'm yurun and

334
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
i know him but you know

335
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
scammers could definitely use this in

336
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
sort of information this is

337
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
such

338
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
a an amazing

339
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
source

340
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,519
of data

341
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
okay um

342
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
so yeah huge amounts of information i

343
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
get raw data for free from latvia uh

344
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,959
without any certification i could be

345
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
criminal i could have a criminal record

346
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,319
no one ever asked me about it

347
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,279
um yeah so how difficult is it to do

348
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,079
this um i already told you in latvia you

349
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,000
can get a reseller for psd2 for for

350
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
nothing within five minutes and then i

351
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
use some amazing tools

352
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
curl basically

353
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
so i just

354
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,920
use the rest api of that reseller um

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
then i converted it to csv uh

356
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,440
for

357
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
viewing it in in calc

358
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
and

359
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
that's basically it but i mean it's this

360
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
easy you could could do it in any way

361
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
you could push it into a python object

362
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
or whatever

363
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,079
and

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,200
do it really automatically

365
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
so

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
i was thinking

367
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,639
this is actually used

368
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
and then i thought it started thinking

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
about um about paypal

370
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,639
because um

371
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,480
if you go to paypal they say you can

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
link your bank account right and in the

373
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,800
old days

374
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
they transfer two amounts of money to

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
you like one cents and five cents and

376
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
then you had to fill out zero one zero

377
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
five and then your bank account is is

378
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,240
matched

379
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
to to your linkedin to your paypal

380
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
account

381
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
not anymore

382
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
so what they now say is link your bank

383
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
account you say

384
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
choose your bank and in holland it looks

385
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
like this

386
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
i just choose my bank

387
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,639
and then

388
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,880
it says this and now it becomes really

389
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
interesting

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
um

391
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
because this text actually says this is

392
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
an actual screenshot from

393
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
from paypal and it says

394
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
login to use your bank account instantly

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
this will allow us to confirm your bank

396
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
account details

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
and

398
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,480
view balances and transactions in your

399
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
bank account anytime it's necessary over

400
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
the next 90 days

401
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
we will save

402
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
and use this data

403
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
exclusively for fraud prevention and

404
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
risk management

405
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
and to make sure there's enough funds

406
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,639
for your paypal payments by continuing

407
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
you agree to the above permissions

408
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
and i was like aha

409
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,920
i know for sure this is that ps psd2

410
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
um

411
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
so yeah

412
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
this is actually used um and

413
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,760
there's very little scope

414
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,800
um

415
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
i sort of trust paypal

416
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
they're not scammers or anything like

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
that but there's a lot of data that

418
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
you're transferring to to paypal and the

419
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
real question is do you want this or do

420
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
you still want to you know

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,639
pay one and two cents and then just you

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,440
know

423
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
link your bank account that way

424
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,839
i think the latter obviously

425
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,399
um

426
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
so let me see um

427
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,199
yeah

428
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
the scope pretty much everything

429
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
and once you've given consent the

430
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,680
consent is valid for 90 days

431
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
so for example if after 80 days they

432
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
want to know let's see what's in the

433
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,519
past 20 days he did you know just

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,839
they can again query your bank account

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
and get all transactions and they can do

436
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,719
this every day

437
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
i think that's a problem

438
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
so

439
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
conclusion

440
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
i do think it's good

441
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
that something like phd exists

442
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
you know not just banks who can actually

443
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
create financial products but actually

444
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
have fintechs who create amazing

445
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
products this way

446
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
but i do think that

447
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
it needs a little bit of you know

448
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
regulation and especially harmonization

449
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,920
and national regulations it was

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
really weird to see that i went from

451
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
holland where i had to do all this stuff

452
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
to to get this data

453
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,399
and then i just went to latvia and i

454
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
said yeah you're fine it's here it is

455
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
without any ask any questions asked so

456
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
harmonization is is definitely needed

457
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,439
here

458
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
um i do think that the consent has to be

459
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
more explicit if we remember this button

460
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
at paypal it's just this big button yeah

461
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
click here to link your bank account and

462
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
no one is going to read this i mean

463
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
south park explained it pretty nicely in

464
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,480
their episode about consent so i think

465
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,520
yeah it should be more explicit

466
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,170
and

467
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,559
[Music]

468
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,280
it should be easy to withdraw consent so

469
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
i try to query my own bank account later

470
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,959
and

471
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,919
um

472
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,319
and it specifically says you can always

473
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,400
if you want to withdraw this consent and

474
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,039
then the 19 days just stops from from

475
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
that moment on they don't have access to

476
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,439
your

477
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,799
data anymore

478
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
um

479
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,960
i haven't found this button yet

480
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,440
so i consider myself a pretty technical

481
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
guy and i was not able to withdraw

482
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
consent so i think there's a there's an

483
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
issue there too this should be

484
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
addressed

485
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
um

486
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,720
yeah

487
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,039
so basically what i'm saying here is

488
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
once the moment you are in this pc to

489
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,480
prison

490
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,320
you won't be pardoned you're locked in

491
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,000
so let's

492
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
there's some time for

493
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
questions i think

494
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,160
so thanks a lot and we do have time for

495
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
questions so if you have any questions

496
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
please line up at the microphones in the

497
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,240
middle of the room

498
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
okay

499
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,480
front microphone please

500
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,080
hello

501
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
i have two questions

502
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,840
i think

503
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
you there

504
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
could be a rather simple

505
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
solutions to

506
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
the problem you state

507
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
when you go to your bank account and can

508
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,679
see which consents

509
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
you have given

510
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,039
and also when you go to your bank

511
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,520
account and can see who has used that

512
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,320
consent so that all

513
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,559
queries are locked for the for the end

514
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,600
user

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
absolutely um

516
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
i think everyone from holland knows the

517
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
whole discussion with the electronic

518
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
patient dossier so all doctors can view

519
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
your medical information

520
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,000
there's this website volcazor for

521
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
example

522
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
and at that website you can see which

523
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
doctor has consent to see your medical

524
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
data and who has actually queried this

525
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
data

526
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,600
i think that's a fantastic solution for

527
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
this and if you would integrate that

528
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
with your electronic

529
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
banking environment

530
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,000
there's your solution but i do think we

531
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,039
should do that

532
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
european white and

533
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,840
yeah but thank you very much okay next

534
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
question please hey yes so this is

535
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
actually my kind of day job to a certain

536
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
extent with these kind of things so um i

537
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
work at a financial institution on their

538
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
side and the paypal bit that you've

539
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
demonstrated is actually on the paypal

540
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,440
side but not the actual scope definition

541
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
which goes on the next screen so you

542
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
click through

543
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
paypal is very greedy with its scopes it

544
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
says everything but you can just do

545
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,720
balances things like that

546
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
the thing is a lot of the banks are

547
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
integrating in very different ways and

548
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
as you say on some banks there is no way

549
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
to withdraw consent or to stop things

550
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,559
after that which is a big problem but

551
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,720
there are other kind of systems out

552
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
there that uh for example open banking

553
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
in the uk where they are very

554
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
prescriptive because it seems a lot of

555
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
things in your talker and resellers not

556
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
doing their proper due diligence on

557
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,440
things and where the pst 2 regulations

558
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
are quite clear as to who can have

559
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,559
access and the level of compliancy and

560
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,840
risk training you have to have to

561
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
actually get access to it

562
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
because i'm i'm registered for open

563
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
banking and psd2 and everything so it's

564
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
a case of depending on how you do it

565
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,480
it's better than the alternative which

566
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
was screen scraping at the time but

567
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,559
there's a huge amount of uh should we

568
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
say

569
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
uh unification of how you withdraw those

570
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
rights universally and make sure that

571
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
people like paypal don't use

572
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,919
ridiculously greedy scopes which go and

573
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,760
cover everything because

574
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,559
i mean usually with um the way the uk

575
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,480
regulator has made it is you have to

576
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
explicitly say this bank account with

577
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,440
this information on the workflow itself

578
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,799
but i think a lot of things could be

579
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
solved with that regulator

580
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
in your jurisdiction going to the

581
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
reseller and saying

582
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
don't do that

583
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
yeah this is of course a little bit the

584
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
issue in the europa

585
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
you know in the united states of europe

586
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
where you have member states and

587
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
everyone is just you know doing it a

588
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,120
little bit differently um

589
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
yeah it is absolutely in psd too and you

590
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
can withdraw uh

591
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
your consent but

592
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
the button is very very hidden i haven't

593
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
found it it's uh that is the real issue

594
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
of course yeah i think with a lot of the

595
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
unit all those bits they just need to

596
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
come up with unification

597
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
okay do you have

598
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
next one please

599
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
thank you thank you very much

600
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
uh first note if the oath you mentioned

601
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
is the banker's oath

602
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
it's no big deal

603
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
i did it at ing

604
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,039
but my question was

605
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,520
i've been given to understand that psd2

606
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,679
does not qualify

607
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,280
your um

608
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
your your bank balance

609
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
has privacy sensitive data

610
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
is that true

611
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
um

612
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
i'm not entirely sure but i'm absolutely

613
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
sure that all the data that we saw here

614
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,679
is

615
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,679
it address is

616
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,840
shopping uh

617
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,960
data order data stuff like that i would

618
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
pretty much say that is personal data

619
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
and even if someone pays at a medical

620
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,480
institute

621
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
you know for let's say for example he

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
pays at the institute for for cancer or

623
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,320
something like that i would say that is

624
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
even the highest level of personal data

625
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
um which i just got

626
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
for free

627
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
so there's

628
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,799
definitely an issue there okay and back

629
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,000
microphone please

630
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,440
so

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
this was a topic that was recently

632
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,840
discussed actually on hacker news

633
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
because

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
new cash comes up every once in a while

635
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
and then people start talking about

636
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
alternatives

637
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,880
and how to get your actual transsexual

638
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
data

639
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
as a person

640
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
and in general this was mentioned

641
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,919
preventing people from building any kind

642
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
of software for

643
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,200
budget management of their own

644
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
could this be a way around it

645
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
then find a reseller that gives you this

646
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
data for free because like in the

647
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
netherlands as you mentioned even i

648
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
checked like for abn amro to get the api

649
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,760
access you need to be a business you

650
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
need to have stuff right so could this

651
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
be a way for a simple person to build an

652
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
open source solution for themselves and

653
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,200
then get that data off a reseller or or

654
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
is giving that reseller

655
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
access to your bank account a bad idea

656
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,799
um

657
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
yeah that's a two-part question so yes

658
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
what you want to do is absolutely

659
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,559
possible with this because you could

660
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
potentially you know say oh so i'm

661
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,799
spending this much in a supermarket and

662
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,640
you know this much on water and

663
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,559
electricity you can definitely do that

664
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
with this data um

665
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,720
the other part is how much do you trust

666
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,840
this reseller

667
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,910
it's a very difficult question

668
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,919
[Music]

669
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
banks sometimes fail too

670
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,840
so

671
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,559
i would say that's extremely difficult

672
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,120
question um

673
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,039
these companies this reseller probably

674
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,679
goes through the exact same sort of

675
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,320
processes that banks go to so they are

676
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
reasonably

677
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
trustworthy i would say

678
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,080
but yeah don't go through the dutch

679
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
paths to get this data to build your own

680
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,159
open source software

681
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
definitely go for the reselling option

682
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,600
there because it's it's a lot a lot

683
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,799
cheaper

684
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
okay question from a front microphone

685
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,159
please

686
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,360
um

687
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,039
i've worked with a french company doing

688
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
open banking

689
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,240
va french banks just don't understand

690
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
the concept of psd2

691
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,679
is generally just the innovation

692
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,480
department which means yeah just for

693
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
money and play with it

694
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,520
so most of the time actually they are

695
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,400
not implementing psd2 what they are

696
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
actually doing to do open banking is web

697
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,640
scrapping

698
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,919
your uh

699
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,480
web the website of your bank

700
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,080
so the issue is not really psd2 the

701
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
issue at least in france the issue is uh

702
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
that banks

703
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
are just

704
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,200
old companies that don't get anything

705
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
about the

706
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,799
the thing called internet yeah

707
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
yes but

708
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,840
if you create a bank extent like psd2

709
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,360
and there's something in it like for

710
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
example consent you know then

711
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,840
implement it you know make that button

712
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,919
somewhere maybe even

713
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
somewhere else on a different website

714
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
where they can withdraw it and um

715
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
yeah

716
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
definitely

717
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,440
my point was just do complain to your

718
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
bank teller tell them that their website

719
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
and their process is shitty and maybe

720
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,559
someday they will

721
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,960
implement psd2 correctly

722
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,279
absolutely thank you and next question

723
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,520
front microphone please um just to

724
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,760
clarify here so it looked like you were

725
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,840
trying to set up a financial institution

726
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,720
in netherlands but you were just going

727
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
through a reseller in lithuania are

728
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
there similar resellers in netherlands

729
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,679
or did you try to set up an

730
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,480
actual financial institution in

731
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
um or latvia oh my god absolutely there

732
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
are services like this in holland

733
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,240
they do exist

734
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,279
they were

735
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,600
rather expensive

736
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,880
and also i don't know the quality of

737
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
them i would say it's pretty much the

738
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
same as any other reseller of psd2

739
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,039
um but it was basically a pricing

740
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,000
problem that was here in holland and

741
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
this pricing problem was probably also

742
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
because of the dutch national bank the

743
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
dnb

744
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
because they have this very strict uh

745
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
regulations here in holland

746
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
um i have the idea that's not the case

747
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
in latvia

748
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,360
and in holland was another issue

749
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
that

750
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,240
the customers of my customer have to be

751
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
onboarded at the reseller here in

752
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
holland

753
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,679
so for example if you would want to use

754
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,440
it for your web shop and you just buy i

755
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
don't know whatever you know you buy

756
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,440
something you buy a tv online

757
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,279
then you would have to onboard at the

758
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
reseller of

759
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,039
where we do the psd2 which was obviously

760
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,799
not acceptable because then you

761
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,880
basically have to check out twice

762
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,399
um yeah

763
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,600
so um

764
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
issues significantly more with the

765
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
reseller system than psd2 itself in any

766
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,679
capacity sorry so the issue is more with

767
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,399
the

768
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,880
data reseller bits than anything with

769
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,399
psd2 as a

770
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,080
legislation

771
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
i think it's because of the national

772
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
implementation of the directives of the

773
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,600
european directives and i think there's

774
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,679
so much leeway there

775
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,640
it changes dramatically from from nation

776
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,039
to nation okay thank you okay and we

777
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,120
have time for one last question so

778
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,159
please my friend so if i understood the

779
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,320
it was ultimately the latvian

780
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,919
institution that

781
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,840
granted that that chose to grant you

782
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,640
access is there any way can you

783
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
essentially

784
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
so essentially that approval

785
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,279
that 90-day approval was just going

786
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
through this latvian institution

787
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,240
is there any way to um essentially opt

788
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,080
out of this so that you

789
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,480
if you have some account you don't want

790
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
other people in other countries to have

791
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,240
access to that

792
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
you mean beforehand before you

793
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
potentially give a consent that you just

794
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
opt out i never want to do this yeah i'm

795
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,440
not aware of that

796
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,480
okay

797
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,399
then that's it

798
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
i would like to thank you for the talk

799
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,600
it was really interesting please give a

800
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,010
