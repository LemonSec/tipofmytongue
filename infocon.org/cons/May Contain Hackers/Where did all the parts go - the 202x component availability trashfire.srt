[Music]

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
hello everyone i'm clement i do

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
electronics

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
i do much less electronics than i'd like

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,560
to because i can't get parts and

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
i suspect you're all suffering from the

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,000
same thing

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
so the thing is yeah since late 2020 an

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360
increasing number of parts have been

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
impossible to buy

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
uh the lead times that is the time

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
between when you order something and

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
when you actually get it has gone up

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
from what used to be about one to two

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,719
months to

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
more than a year

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,879
sometimes over 80 weeks

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,680
and

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
those lead times keep shifting backwards

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,800
as well

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,719
so like even if you

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,239
order something now

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,399
to be delivered a year from now it may

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720
actually be delayed and

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
this is new it's scary it's never

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
happened before in the entire industry

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
uh so let's try and understand it and

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
see how it happened

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
so i'm going to give you a bit of

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
background on how chips are manufactured

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,759
and

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,560
how

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
how the electronics market works

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
and then we're going to go over what

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
actually happened

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,280
that broke things and

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
why they are so difficult to fix

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,560
so um the electronics ecosystem you have

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
chip designers you have foundries you

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,439
have chip vendors distributors product

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
manufacturers and end users

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
so chip designers design chips

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
they send their designs to foundries

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
then you have chip vendors who either

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
own or rent foundry capacity

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
and then you have

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
them selling

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,119
chips to either distributors or to

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,960
manufacturers directly

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,600
and manufacturers manufacture products

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,160
and then sell them to users that's how

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
it normally works

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
foundries this may be a new thing to

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
some of you so foundries are a

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
specialized kind of factory

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
that

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
basically is designed around etching

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
silicon wafers

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
so they they'll put some layers of a

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
circuit into silicon wafers and add a

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
lot of metal layers on top of that

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
silicon and that's then a ready chip

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
and each of those production lines is

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
built around the particular scale

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
so you can have uh chips with smaller

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
things on them smaller transistors on

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
them and you can have bigger ones and

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
they can't all be used for all purposes

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
now an important thing to understand

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,239
here is that this process takes a really

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
long time it can take months

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,680
between when you actually put in

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
a

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
chip order

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
to when it actually gets

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
gets ready to package

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,440
so

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,480
you need to plan these things in advance

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
and you need to be looking

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,599
9 to 11 sometimes even longer months

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
ahead

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
now about these process notes so these

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
are the scales of things on a chip so

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
smaller things they can switch faster

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
and they use less power

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
and bigger things can have the more

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
voltage more current and more

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
interference electromagnetic radiation

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
voltage variations that sort of things

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
and bigger things are easier to make

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
so they they have better yield so less

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
of it goes to waste when you manufacture

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,720
the smallest nodes are what uh

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
processors and gpus use

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
that's the ones that you see in

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
marketing you have five nanometers seven

97
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
nanometers this sort of thing

98
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
which uh chip manufacturers really like

99
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
to make advertising with

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
um but

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
microcontrollers for example use bigger

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439
nodes and most of the ics

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,639
in the world

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
actually use even bigger nodes because

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
it's much much cheaper and it's much

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
easier to manufacture

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
so you

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
pretty much everything around you uses

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
microchips that are made on fairly large

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
process nodes

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
and the problem is nobody is actually

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,360
making large process node equipment

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,400
anymore

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,240
so what happens is you build a

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
production line

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
on the latest greatest thing which is

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
the smallest possible node and then you

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,479
need space to put that in because those

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
things are gigantic

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
so these are these are entire complexes

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
of buildings

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
so they're like okay we're we have this

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
new and greatest thing we need to get

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
rid of everything that we already have

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
so let's just sell it down to somebody

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
else

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
and then they got bought by a smaller

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
foundry who doesn't have that much money

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
and they're less famous and they they

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
have less like market power

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
and they they get to manufacture the

132
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
larger process nodes

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
and they get much less profit out of it

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
so they have lower margins

135
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
and nobody manufactures large node

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
equipment anymore because it's much more

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,880
profitable to to be going with the

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,800
latest thing

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
so all this larger process node

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
equipment just gets passed down and

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
there's no new market for it

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
so this has been working for several

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
decades fairly well there's never been a

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
ship shortage

145
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,039
uh so yeah let's look at what happened

146
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,960
to break it

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,759
so in early 2020

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,280
a bunch of car executives have a

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
conference call and they go look there's

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
gonna be a recession

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,960
uh everything's shutting down people are

152
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
going to buy less everything they're

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
going to buy less cars we should make

154
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,479
less cars

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
and

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
yeah

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
car manufacturers are a bit of a special

158
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
thing

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
in that their contracts

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
with their suppliers

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
are extremely flexible for the car

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
manufacturer

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
so they don't commit to buying anything

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
they just pay for what they buy so they

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,759
call up other suppliers and go hey you

166
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
know what uh we're actually not going to

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
be buying anything this year so you can

168
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
produce it if you want we're not going

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
to pay for it you do whatever you want

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,520
so other suppliers take a massive sigh

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,039
and go like okay this is going to cost a

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
lot of money

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
so what they do is they call up all

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
their foundries and go actually

175
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
i know we ordered all these wafers for

176
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
this year but we're not going to need

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
them sell them to someone else

178
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
and i know we have to pay a penalty for

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
this it's how it is

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
and they reassign all their foundry

181
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
slots

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
to everything that's not the stuff used

183
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
in cars

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,280
and everything that's not the stuff used

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,199
in cars is still fairly useful stuff you

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,840
have power management ics you have logic

187
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,440
ics you have all sorts of things and

188
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
yeah the entertainment industry was very

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
happy to take those they can make more

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
tvs they can make more playstations

191
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,840
that's great

192
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
right so the foundees

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
get a bit upset at this because they

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,199
have to cancel things mid-process so

195
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
they have to throw away some stock that

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
they've been

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
working with

198
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
because it's now too expensive to

199
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,479
actually turn it into a finished product

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,199
that nobody will buy so a bit of

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
manufacturing capacity is lost here but

202
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,720
you know this happens every once in a

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,840
while so that's fine

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
so a bit of background here to the car

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,039
industry

206
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
so

207
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
um at some point the car industry

208
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,720
developed this management philosophy

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
which has turned into a sort of religion

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
do not have any inventory ever

211
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
so this was a thing designed by toyota

212
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
originally and they came up with this

213
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,919
because they they had all these

214
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
factories around them in the region near

215
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,720
them

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,919
which were delivering parts to them

217
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,560
and they figured out if we actually

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
don't get these parts delivered until we

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
actually need them it's much more

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,720
efficient because we don't need to store

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
them in our warehouses

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,440
so if they're next door we can keep them

223
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
in their warehouse bring them over when

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
we need them

225
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,039
and

226
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,399
that's fine

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
and this has kind of grown a bit into a

228
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
kind of uh like point of truth for the

229
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
car industry that like never keep any

230
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
inventory ever because this worked so

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
well for toyota and toyota was really

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
killing it in the 80s so like we all

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
have to do that and they all do that

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
and they can do this in

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
in a situation where

236
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
where basically you have a global supply

237
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
chain and things get shipped across the

238
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
planet

239
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
because they can then just push that

240
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
inventory risk onto their vendors and go

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
like okay if you want us to buy 10

242
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
million parts from you

243
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
you're going to have to deliver them

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
within this 15-minute window and we're

245
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
going to tell you a week ahead how many

246
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
we need

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,480
and

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
you take that or you leave it

249
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,080
so yeah this is really risky for the

250
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
park vendors because they may be stuck

251
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,839
with a warehouse for stuff they can't

252
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,120
sell but yeah that's that's how it is

253
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,920
so

254
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
they figure okay like demand for cars

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
doesn't really change that much here

256
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
over here right

257
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,560
so like

258
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
i yeah we can take the risk and we'll

259
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
figure it out

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
so what happens in 2020 yeah people

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
don't like public transport and they

262
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
work remotely so they move out of cities

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
so they're buying more cars than ever

264
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,240
before so all the car executives have a

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
panic conference call and go hey all

266
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
these parts we cancelled we want them

267
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
back and more and more

268
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
and

269
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,079
yeah all the vendors go yeah we can't

270
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
make those off

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
we're gonna go out of business if we

272
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
actually need that

273
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
so the car companies go

274
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,839
okay

275
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,079
we have no inventory our production

276
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,800
lines are stopped we're screwed we can't

277
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
make anything

278
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,399
so

279
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,079
yeah i know we have this really

280
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,200
contract

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
but we're going to actually pay you

282
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
anything you want

283
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
so all the component vendors go okay

284
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,480
great we can do that

285
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
so the market price settles at about

286
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
eight times the original prices

287
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,079
and they just cancel everything else and

288
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,760
just start producing car related parts

289
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
which is great for them because then

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
they can you know slightly recover their

291
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,959
losses

292
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,040
from the extremely low margins that

293
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
they've been

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
having to deal with

295
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
and all those non-cancer tap slots get

296
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
reassigned to those so everything else

297
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
stops being manufactured and because

298
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
you're changing mid process in a process

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
that takes months

300
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,200
you end up with a lot of scrap

301
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
so all the stuff that was being

302
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
manufactured at that point gets thrown

303
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
away it's like okay start over we're

304
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
making this now

305
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,519
right great not that great

306
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
um

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
yeah at the same time

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,079
we have a few disasters

309
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,839
so

310
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,640
um

311
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
in texas

312
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
texas is a really popular place for

313
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,680
foundries to be

314
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
because

315
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
they don't give a about pollution

316
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
and they have occasionally very cheap

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
power

318
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,000
and

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
they're very very industry friendly

320
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,279
so a bunch of foundries are in there

321
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
uh yeah

322
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
texas has terrible grid management so

323
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,120
early 2021 texas froze over

324
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
a bunch of water pipes in nxps and

325
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,720
samsung's foundries in the walls

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
of their clean rooms broke

327
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
because they froze over

328
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,720
they sprayed a bunch of dirty water into

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
the clean rooms all the production was

330
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
lost factory was lost

331
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,600
like

332
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
yeah they they lost months and months

333
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,959
and months of production

334
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
and uh in japan there's renaissance so

335
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
nxp is the number one biggest uh

336
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
automotive ic supplier

337
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
uh samsung is number three renesas is

338
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
number two so renaissance their main

339
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,000
factory in japan they had a fire they

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
got smoke in their clean room

341
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
contaminated all their wafers they had

342
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
to throw all their wafers away

343
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,800
uh yeah akm um manufacturer of audio

344
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,079
chips

345
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
used in all sorts of pro audio equipment

346
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
they had a fire in another factory in

347
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,639
japan they lost their factory

348
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
so all these things are happening at the

349
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
same time

350
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
so

351
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,839
yeah early 2021 some effects of this

352
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
start becoming visible

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
so some parts are starting to run low on

354
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
stock thankfully we have distributors

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
and distributors are great because they

356
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
will buy up parts in bulk and then

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
resell them in smaller quantities and

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
they can kind of level out these effects

359
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,360
of the market kind of moving around so

360
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
they still have some stock and this is

361
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
great because then you can still buy

362
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
from them and you can make things

363
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,519
but

364
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
some parts are starting to run low on

365
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
stock and they're running lower than

366
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
they've ever been before

367
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,480
and lead times are going up a bit and

368
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,519
yeah

369
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
some parts the ones that are used in

370
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,839
cars have massively gone up in price

371
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,680
and this is really weird this has never

372
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
happened before in the industry so

373
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
everybody gets a bit panicky

374
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,920
and now everybody who's making anything

375
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
with electronics has a problem and the

376
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
problem is

377
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,880
electronics devices have many many parts

378
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
in them and if one of them is missing

379
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,199
you cannot manufacture the entire thing

380
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,560
so

381
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
normally this would mean like okay we

382
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
 up with our ordering we need to

383
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,519
wait a month or two before we can

384
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,279
produce more but we have some stock

385
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,399
we're fine

386
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,440
um

387
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
but yeah now the lead times are jumping

388
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,160
up to 16 18 20 13 weeks

389
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
which has never happened before

390
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,360
so

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
yeah you panic and you buy everything in

392
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
advance

393
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,399
because if you don't have everything you

394
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
can't produce anything

395
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,839
so you buy as much as you can

396
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
as soon as it's available because you

397
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
have no idea if you'll ever be able to

398
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
get it again

399
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,000
and

400
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
of course if you're a small electronics

401
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
manufacturer you can't afford to do that

402
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,120
but hey it's low interest rate season so

403
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
borrow a ton of money buy

404
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,920
everything

405
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,360
because otherwise you're out of business

406
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
because you have no product to sell

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,279
and a bunch of products get actually

408
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
redesigned

409
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,760
around parts that are more available

410
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,720
which makes those parts less available

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,639
and there's this wonderful cascading

412
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
effect and at the end there's just no

413
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
stock of anything anyway so every

414
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
microcontroller is gone all the memory

415
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,399
chips are gone

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
a bunch of logic chips are gone voltage

417
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,320
regulators

418
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
like even the things that like you never

419
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,680
imagined would ever be a problem

420
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,279
like a

421
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,320
7805 voltage regulator

422
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
it's gone nobody sells it anymore so all

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,800
these things just just just disappear

424
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
right and the problem when the market

425
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
just goes to zero

426
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,360
is that the price and availability

427
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,000
signaling system that normally runs the

428
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,120
market

429
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,199
just fails

430
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,839
so everybody's hoarding because they

431
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,199
need to hoard because otherwise they

432
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,839
can't produce however nobody's actually

433
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,880
making more stuff

434
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
actually they're making less stuff

435
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,720
because they can't really

436
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
afford to take financial risks because

437
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,639
they've just put all their financial

438
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
risk budget into sourcing components

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
so all the chip manufacturers know this

440
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
and they know at some point this

441
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
hoarding will eventually end because

442
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
everybody has all their parts and they

443
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
don't need to buy anymore for the next

444
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
five years

445
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,240
so

446
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,279
if you're

447
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
trying to set up a new assembly line

448
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
which will take you

449
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
11 12 months to set up

450
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
and

451
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
yeah by that time nobody's buying

452
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,279
anything you've just paid for a new

453
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,959
assembly line

454
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,040
and you've just entirely lost all your

455
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
margins on everything you made and

456
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
that that assembly line will just be

457
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
idle

458
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,319
so

459
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,480
chip manufacturers know if they miss

460
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
time this

461
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,959
they they will be ruined

462
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,000
and

463
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,079
they don't know what the timing is going

464
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
to look like because all their market

465
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
signaling has just gone away

466
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
so everyone's doing what seems best for

467
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
them because they have no information

468
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
about the future and they're all

469
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
operating in the dark

470
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
so yeah um this didn't work out great

471
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,440
for the car manufacturers either

472
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,160
so

473
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,960
they

474
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
they had to all stop production

475
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
this this summer with the exception of

476
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,840
toyota who apparently is not that

477
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,840
religious about not keeping stock

478
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
because you know it's it doesn't

479
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
actually make sense

480
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
like you can you can get

481
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,559
like all the ics that a car factory

482
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,679
needs

483
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
for two years worth of production can

484
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
fit on this stage

485
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
it's not much

486
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
it's not like you're storing stacks of

487
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
car body parts but nope nope we can't

488
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,679
keep stock just in time that's the way

489
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,799
it goes

490
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,440
yeah so car manufacturers panic and they

491
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,360
go like okay let's let's force our

492
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
governments to force the chip

493
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,600
manufacturers to only sell to us

494
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
which didn't work because like there was

495
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,760
nothing to sell

496
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
so that that just screwed them over and

497
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
basically

498
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,640
every every car manufacturer in europe

499
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
was

500
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
having their production lines completely

501
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,159
stopped this summer

502
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,679
yeah

503
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
last summer

504
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
right

505
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
so the political response to this was we

506
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
must construct additional foundries we

507
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
cannot be dependent on like foundry

508
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
capacity being this law

509
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
so yeah who's making foundries in those

510
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
making foundries let's give them all the

511
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,120
money

512
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,840
uh turns out nobody is actually making

513
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,600
boundaries for the things that are in

514
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
shortage

515
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
nobody's even making foundry equipment

516
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
for the things that are in shortage

517
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
because this stuff was last manufactured

518
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
in 2004

519
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
and like

520
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
nobody's making it anymore nobody's

521
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,120
making 200 nanometer

522
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
exposure machines anymore

523
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,559
it just

524
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,799
it's just not profitable you make way

525
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
more money going to seven five three

526
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
nanometer

527
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
so

528
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
nothing actually changes except intel

529
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,880
got a ton of money for nothing

530
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
so intel actually went into

531
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
on the on the news cycle

532
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
going oh yeah car manufacturers redesign

533
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,840
all your stuff to work on 14 nanometers

534
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,039
and we can

535
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,600
we can build as much as you want

536
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
because we got those

537
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
and like yeah okay like if you can get

538
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
car batteries down to 3.3 volts that

539
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
could work

540
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
but yeah

541
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
nope

542
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
so yeah uh how to fix this the core

543
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
problem

544
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
is you cannot you have no visibility

545
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
into the future you have no idea what's

546
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
going to happen

547
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,480
like

548
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
availability of something

549
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,679
it

550
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,640
is just

551
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
it's just going to

552
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,080
change at some point in the indefinite

553
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,559
future you have no idea when

554
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,159
and if you miss time it you're screwed

555
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,320
so there are some solutions to this so

556
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
for example

557
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
microchip

558
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
sent the letter to other customers i got

559
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
it as well

560
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,440
and they went hey we know this is

561
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
it's for us too

562
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,679
uh how about you tell us how much you're

563
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
going to need a year from now of each

564
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
part you're going to need

565
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
and we'll provide them 11 months from

566
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
now

567
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,159
and

568
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
if you change your mind you don't get

569
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,559
your money back

570
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,799
so yeah this is great you commit to

571
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,840
something you know what's going to

572
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
happen in the future

573
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
as long as they actually deliver

574
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
so a customer of mine had this with

575
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
another vendor

576
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
who i will not name but it's a big

577
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,919
three-letter electronics manufacturer

578
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,320
starting with then

579
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,120
so

580
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,919
they

581
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,120
they had a commitment to get things at

582
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
by a particular date

583
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,640
and

584
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
then

585
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
that vendor decided to just give it to

586
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
somebody who gave them more money

587
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,919
so

588
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,799
yeah

589
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,640
it's like that's not how you manufacture

590
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
trust it's doesn't work

591
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,480
so

592
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,200
the problem is like

593
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
the trust in the market

594
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
is something that is really really

595
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
difficult to recover the manufacturing

596
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
itself has by now recovered

597
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
like we

598
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
we

599
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
these short shocks to the manufacturing

600
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200
process

601
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,679
which happened from changing things

602
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
around rapidly that's that's already

603
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
been recovered from

604
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
but the the confidence in the market

605
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,600
is gone

606
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
and it will take a really really long

607
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,480
time

608
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
to get that trust back again and until

609
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,840
we do we're all operating in dark

610
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,559
so there are some medium term solutions

611
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
so you can redesign things around

612
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,320
availability

613
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
i have been doing that with customers

614
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
and it's been an absolute pain

615
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,919
because you

616
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,960
yeah you design a thing because a part

617
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,559
is available

618
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
and then you do one production batch and

619
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
then it's not available anymore and you

620
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
have to design it again

621
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,120
so

622
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
in one case we had one product which was

623
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,080
redesigned four times

624
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
different part every time and

625
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
yeah each one got one production run

626
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
with the maximum number of parts

627
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,720
available at the time

628
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
which was not very much

629
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,799
and yeah there are some vendors that are

630
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,080
less affected

631
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
so this this has been an issue for

632
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
hacker camps as well this year

633
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
especially the ones that have badges

634
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
uh yeah

635
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,240
so they've been forced to use vendors

636
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,120
that

637
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
have better availability

638
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
so for example the

639
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
the badge for this camp has a chip by

640
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
expressive

641
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,520
which are much less affected because no

642
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
car vendors use them

643
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,200
so that's great they

644
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
basically were not screwed by this at

645
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
all so they could just continue

646
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,559
production as normal

647
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,240
a lot of people are actually buying

648
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
parts before they design

649
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,159
and this is what i'd recommend for

650
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
hobbyists as well just buy the things

651
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,000
first and then design your thing around

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
them

653
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
um it does happen on a larger scale as

654
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
well so i had one customer call me and

655
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
go like oh we've bought this many

656
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
thousands of this part

657
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
and we hope you can redesign our product

658
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
to work with it

659
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
so yeah that does happen it's just the

660
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
sort of thing which a year earlier you

661
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,400
would never have imagined hearing

662
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
yeah and there's also some vendors that

663
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
are starting to manufacture function

664
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,799
compatible parts

665
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,279
to sort of substitute for the gaps in

666
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
the market

667
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
for vendors that

668
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,400
that have been severely screwed

669
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
so you have sd

670
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,080
was very badly affected by this so stm32

671
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
parts for example are completely gone

672
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,880
and there's several vendors there's wch

673
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
and there's giga device who are making

674
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
stm32 code compatible and ping

675
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
compatible parts

676
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,679
and that has saved a lot of people

677
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
yeah but

678
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,400
those those are very temporary solutions

679
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,880
so medium-term solutions

680
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
we need to reduce the fragility of the

681
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
system by not screwing the vendors on

682
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
contract terms

683
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,240
so if we can optimize for trust

684
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,960
then this will stabilize the markets and

685
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
everyone will make more money even if

686
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,240
they're not optimizing for making more

687
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
money

688
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
and

689
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
we need to not support bullies

690
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
so the the reason that the car companies

691
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
can get away with

692
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
screwing their vendors so badly is

693
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
because they have the financial and

694
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,360
political power to do so so they can go

695
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
okay we'll pull this contract

696
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,080
and your company goes out of business so

697
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
you do exactly what we say and they can

698
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,559
get away with this and i don't think

699
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,120
that's right

700
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
right

701
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
yeah um i do have five minutes left

702
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
um

703
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
and i think i'll stop here and take some

704
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
questions

705
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
okay if there are any questions please

706
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
line up at the microphones in the middle

707
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,039
in the meantime thus the internet

708
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,640
has any questions

709
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,320
not yet okay

710
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,840
then microphone in the back please

711
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
hello

712
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
you said in your talk that there was

713
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
nobody to be made

714
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,480
for 200 nanometers

715
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
fabs

716
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
i'm not mistaken

717
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
that was the assumption at the time yes

718
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
yes

719
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
i've read in some press or i think it

720
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,320
was bloomberg or something not

721
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,480
specialized i mean

722
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
that there was uh

723
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
very sorry a lot of companies that are

724
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
currently building

725
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
fabs in india

726
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
especially for these common parts

727
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,799
can you confirm that rumor that

728
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,279
yeah so lots of people are building fabs

729
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
for those processes

730
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,720
but they're built with old equipment

731
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,880
so there's it's very difficult at the

732
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
moment to actually get new equipment for

733
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,799
anything but the latest nodes and it's

734
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,000
actually very difficult to get new

735
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,080
equipment for those as well because the

736
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
capacity for the equipment manufacturers

737
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,158
is completely gone

738
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,440
okay then microphone in the front please

739
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,279
no so you explained indeed how this

740
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
problem occurred for most of the silicon

741
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,440
components but we've even found that for

742
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,559
one of uh

743
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,919
one of our projects essentially we are

744
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,159
running out of basic things like plastic

745
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,840
connector housings which are spiked in

746
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,960
price like one euro per basic connector

747
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,799
is that still a part of the same panic

748
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,480
box this is this is the same thing so

749
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,640
like if you're missing one item on your

750
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,559
bomb on your bill of materials you

751
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,399
cannot produce your whole product so you

752
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,640
buy absolutely everything you need like

753
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,399
some people are having trouble getting

754
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,840
particular lengths of screws

755
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
it is really that bad

756
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,120
okay microphone in the back please

757
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
yes uh so we have this list of medium

758
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,159
term solutions uh on the

759
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
projector now

760
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
but

761
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
won't these uh raise the end user prices

762
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
a bit so then the question is uh will

763
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,760
end users accept higher prices

764
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,440
well they either accept higher prices

765
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,880
they're getting higher prices now

766
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,760
because

767
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
scalpers are buying everything up and

768
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,640
reselling it to them

769
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,679
so

770
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,720
yeah we are definitely underpaying the

771
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,600
entire manufacturing chain

772
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
well maybe my question is do you think

773
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
solutions like this will work out in the

774
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
longer term or will the market just

775
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
settle back in what it was before

776
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
because that's the cheapest way to

777
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
operate

778
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,039
yeah so the only long-term solution is

779
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,240
basically unfuck the system and

780
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,880
like optimize for stability rather than

781
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
maximum profit

782
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,679
okay and the next question microphone in

783
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
the back please

784
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,360
yeah you you told some insights about

785
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,320
the

786
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,880
car manufacturing industry and

787
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
supposed and maybe not

788
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
shared by all practices of lean

789
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,360
production

790
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,799
for at least for the german car

791
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,919
manufacturers i also read that they had

792
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
a problem because they outsource a lot

793
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
of their

794
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
stuff as components by third-party

795
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,520
vendors and

796
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,799
that made it even more difficult to uh

797
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,640
yeah to change something because they

798
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
just get the part and then somebody else

799
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
has to

800
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
do that can you say do you know anything

801
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
more about that can you say something

802
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
yeah so what's uh the issue there is uh

803
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,840
basically those vendors are committed to

804
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
a fixed price

805
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,720
but their own costs go up massively so

806
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
they are just unable to deliver that

807
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,679
price

808
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,799
until

809
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,960
until basically their their customers

810
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,760
agree to pay more

811
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,240
i'm really sorry but we are out of time

812
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
but i'm sure clement will be available

813
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,039
for questions afterwards so please give

814
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,840
him a nice round of applause

815
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,739
[Applause]

816
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,678
you
