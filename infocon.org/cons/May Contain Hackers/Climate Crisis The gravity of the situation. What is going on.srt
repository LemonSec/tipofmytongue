2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,119
good so then

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,400
also with people online if there's

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,160
anybody watching welcome

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
group mind mapping and brainstorm

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,480
exercise so um i guess

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
the goal that i was going to show you on

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
the screen but i can't now is developing

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,680
a robust personal strategy to deal with

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
likely ecological social economic

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,000
disruptions in let's say about 20 to 30

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
years from now a cheery and pleasant

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,879
topic as i mean

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,160
no but well extremely important right so

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
and i think that's all of us are here

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
with that idea that okay we know climate

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,879
change is real that there's going to be

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
some unpleasant things you can either

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
ignore it or you can try to like any

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
other threat start dealing with it and

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
think about preparing it because

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,320
any step you take now is step it won't

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
hurt so what i would like to do is

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
i'm assuming let's just start with that

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
i'm assuming we are all

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,360
familiar with the basic

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
climate change stuff right so but let me

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
just quickly summarize

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
we're thinking

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
if you look at the science um

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,439
increasingly severe weather

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
so usually wherever you live imagine

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
what you have but then worse

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
so climate change means more intense

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,439
oscillations

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,240
higher higher highs lower lows

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
 being more frequent

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
stuff like that in some extreme cases

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
plausible that things flip into very

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,759
different

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
weather patterns

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
if you're in a very very wet area it

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
might become very dry these things are

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
possible but for the sake of our sanity

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,159
let's keep it in the

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,600
more extreme things so what i would like

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
to do as a first step

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
is to imagine that 20 to 30 years

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
just kind of think for yourself okay

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,399
where am i you know how old am i because

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
we're all different right and i'll be

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
close to

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,759
20 50 or put me close to 70.

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,360
75 even

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
uh so i'll be old man

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
older than now

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
um

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
so that i might you know and i see

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
younger people as well for you you might

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
be

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
later when i'm adult might be them

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
so

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
imagine yourself you're there and what's

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,040
outside the window what do you see

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,239
and i know we've come from different

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,239
places so if you're in a if you live in

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,000
switzerland you will see different

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
things around you maybe molten

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
molten glaciers you might see

70
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
mountains that have no vegetation

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
because the rain has stripped them off

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,879
if you live in holland you might have

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
been flooded once or twice because of

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
too much rain

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
so okay just for the physics for those

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,319
that are from the netherlands the

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
expectation the science i know is 2050

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
don't worry about it this is the last

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,800
place you want to worry about flooding

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
sea level

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,480
because we are obviously at the very low

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
place

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
if you look at the specifically dutch

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
situation the level of protection we

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,480
have institutional systems in place

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
and the physical everything we got we'll

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
find for the next 150 years is three

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
four five meters will be fine

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
it's not a good

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
cost

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
i'm strictly physical i'm saying from

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
the physical perspective it will not

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
likely be flooded in holland from the

94
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,360
sea

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
you will however be much more likely

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
flooded by rain

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
population actually

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,560
i

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
fully understand and that's not my point

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
is try to think of where you live

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,959
because we're trying to think about

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
strategies what do i do now because i

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
cannot help bangladesh directly right

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
now they're no matter what badly

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
indonesia and and you don't want to be

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
in miami either all of those places

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
but i'm not there and that's not i can't

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
control that i do live minus four and a

109
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,599
half meters below sea level in the

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,640
polder

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
so for me rain for example local is a

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
huge problem

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,799
if the pumps that evacuate my polder are

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,200
broken i am on a swim

115
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
so i would like to collect from oh just

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
think about it what kind of weather what

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
do i have today and what do i think

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
can you use one or two three words so we

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,799
can group them together to see what do

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,760
we

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
what is the range of things you might

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
expect

123
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
right

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
so just give you a couple of minutes and

125
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,759
then

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,519
just wait and i'll

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
collect your sticky notes and i'll start

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,799
speaking about it

129
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,300
[Music]

130
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,199
okay

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,280
come on

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
and also think

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
think about the the

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,320
what's your

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
not just weather but also what kind of

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
biological environment am i in am i

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
forced

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
am i on the

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
farming land do i live around farming

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
land what that might mean for me as

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
let's say if i'm

142
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
in a play area and it's going to be

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
raining like mad all the time or i'm on

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
sand and maybe there is torrential rains

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
but if i am in an environment where

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
if a winter goes extreme and freezes

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
that helpful release for four weeks it

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
doesn't fall

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
right again just thinking about where am

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
i doing you know what do i see now what

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
is the shitty weather i really hate

152
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
imagining times ten

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
and then five times a year not once

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,720
every five minutes

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
because that's the order manager we're

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
talking about at this

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
time so next

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
year

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
beyond that nobody really knows

160
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
right what do i expect

161
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
what do i expect in terms of

162
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
birds and the bees do i still

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,199
is that something i care

164
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,360
posterity i'll start grouping and you

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
shout if you don't agree right it's like

166
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
no no because i want to reduce the

167
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,680
number to

168
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
a manageable sort of clusters of things

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
let's see if it's possible i'll just

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,360
randomly start grabbing we have drought

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
that is clear

172
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,480
what do you mean by drought whoever

173
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
wrote that

174
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,880
not enough available fresh water on our

175
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
agricultural fields so you meant

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
something more much more specific okay

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
so drought specifically

178
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,660
agree food

179
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,760
[Music]

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
okay

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
i have natural resources supply chain

182
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
breakdowns i will park supply chains

183
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
because i want to have that more

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,040
economic side of things

185
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
floods pollution plastic toxins toxic

186
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,519
excellent so this is floods let's put

187
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,560
drought there

188
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
floods there

189
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,360
what's here i think very interesting

190
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
here is the

191
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
the link to the

192
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
toxics right there is the

193
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,959
one of the side effects of brexit at

194
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,519
some point was oh now we have

195
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
the waste processing for manure is

196
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,079
backed up because normally goes to

197
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,440
holland now it stays the uk and now

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
they're having these spillovers

199
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
of basically raw animal sewage going to

200
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
the waters because they just can't deal

201
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
with it and this is a kind of thing

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
where

203
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
once you start flooding and we've seen

204
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
that in new orleans with the last flood

205
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,240
it's dead cows and gasoline and

206
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
oil refineries being flooded and you do

207
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,400
not want to swim in that

208
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,510
[Music]

209
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
right so this is interesting so i like

210
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,800
this one so we have flood and we have

211
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
pollution so that's a very interesting

212
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
one and how do you then deal with the

213
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
crap

214
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,640
let's say you have a garden and now it's

215
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,320
been has a layer of toxic mud

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
awesome

217
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
extreme heat

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,720
less trees than now okay so keep it with

219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,839
the drought so we have the high

220
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
temperatures droughts

221
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,320
climate refugees i will park a social

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
super rapid the biodiversity loss okay

223
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
bio let's keep the bio together

224
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,959
bio is

225
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,240
what does that mean for you whoever

226
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
wrote that one

227
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
diversity of species

228
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,320
but what what does it mean for us it's

229
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
not me i'm sitting at home in my garden

230
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
and going again supply chain so this is

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
this food it cascades into everything

232
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
yeah

233
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,440
okay so this is i will add here sort of

234
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
food

235
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,320
and then the rest

236
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
and this is at least the thing that you

237
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,639
know i spend a lot of my time thinking

238
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,240
about systems scientifically and it's

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
all we get that

240
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
but then what the f what does that mean

241
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,600
right because and that's the hard that's

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,880
the hard part how do you bring it down

243
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
right and then we'll keep this one

244
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
please do remember this because we'll

245
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
come back at the economics and then

246
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
becomes food and it becomes justice and

247
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
it becomes yeah that part

248
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
more frequent extreme weather events

249
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
i'll keep it somewhere here i guess

250
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
um also here whenever you whoever wrote

251
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
this one specifically try to think about

252
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
for your situation what does that mean

253
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
for you

254
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
are you in the mountain are you usually

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
get caught by blizzards

256
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
uh-huh what if i have

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
non-stop lizards for a month

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
right because then becomes that's that's

259
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
when you can start grabbing it because

260
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
more extreme weather is like whatever

261
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
right

262
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
more deserts

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,770
lack of drinking water i'll keep it here

264
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,320
[Music]

265
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,920
i'm already depressed storms okay

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
storms storms are

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,760
insurance companies hate storms

268
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,600
right they damage a lot of things

269
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
and they damage things over a wide area

270
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,959
i did some

271
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
european projects on

272
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
flooding storm damage floods they don't

273
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,639
care about floods are local in general

274
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
in the in the world of insurance

275
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
companies storms

276
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
come in at many hundreds of scale

277
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
kilometers and hit everything

278
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,320
so okay if it's a storm

279
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
if you live in a flat

280
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,839
you have a different thing to worry

281
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
about and if you own a house

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
we were hit in netherlands we had a

283
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
storm in of them was it no was it again

284
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
november uh half my neighborhood lost

285
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
roofs i was i was luckily fine but my

286
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
neighbors were not

287
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
solar panels flying

288
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
trees

289
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
so that means okay fine if i'm preparing

290
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,399
for

291
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
and that's clearly a short-term

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
emergency

293
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,639
i have a hole in my roof now what

294
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
okay so if that's a likely event and

295
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
storms are

296
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
the easy likely thing to have what do i

297
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
then do to make sure that and we can

298
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
talk about that in a minute

299
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
no pollinators

300
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
bees food

301
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
put it there unemployment i'll park here

302
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
with

303
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,399
economics and so sea level rise

304
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,399
increasing

305
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
something

306
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
sea level rise i'll put that under the

307
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,760
flooding

308
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
the difficulty thing with sea level rise

309
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,320
is that you don't necessarily need to

310
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
have a lot of sea level rise to start

311
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,120
having problems

312
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
it's not necessarily about i'm going to

313
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
have permanent water up to here

314
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
but even a little bit more water will

315
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,920
allow

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
much more frequent

317
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
you go to the pacific islands

318
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,440
right

319
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,399
you don't

320
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,639
erosion right so that's also coupled

321
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,680
with storms because these things are

322
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,279
nasty especially dutch coast is

323
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,920
sensitive to that also here

324
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
whenever you think for yourself

325
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,839
what does it mean for me it really

326
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
depends where you are

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
right and because of the social and

328
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,120
physical systems involved in the

329
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,959
netherlands this is the least of my

330
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,040
worries in terms of flooding which weird

331
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
enough because we are so extremely well

332
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
prepared

333
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,079
in the netherlands we always bring sand

334
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,959
to the beach yes

335
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
millions of towns

336
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
a year of sand to the beach

337
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
and if the sea level rises you have to

338
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,639
increase that and significantly

339
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,079
and

340
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,959
also

341
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,880
the the wind

342
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,920
areas also have explosives so yeah we

343
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,320
have to see where we can win the set so

344
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,519
it's

345
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,000
it's not nothing i mean at this moment

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,279
it's okay but

347
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,720
agreed

348
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
agreed so the

349
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,120
if you're comparing severity of dealing

350
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
with this let's say in the dutch dutch

351
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
coast where you have

352
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,079
i mean the dutch water boards are over a

353
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
thousand years old institution

354
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
democratic institutions in the situation

355
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
where you have that context

356
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,839
a high risk

357
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,959
is probably going to be less of an

358
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
impact the same kind of situation

359
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
without the institutional context

360
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
without the role rules and the systems

361
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
in place is catastrophic and that's what

362
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
makes it so hard because generally it's

363
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
like well sure high water is sometimes a

364
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,640
huge problem sometimes not as

365
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
and that again depends you know if

366
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,640
you're on french coast

367
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,039
just 500 kilometers more south this

368
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,319
becomes a problem because they do not

369
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,760
have that setup

370
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,199
because they never had to worry about it

371
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,039
and dutch did

372
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
so

373
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
what's not to worry in holland might be

374
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,480
a war in the french coast

375
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
and again depending on where you are try

376
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
to think those things through for

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
yourself that's why we cannot really

378
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,559
there's no one solution right it's going

379
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,559
to be all piece wheels for your local

380
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
situation within your context

381
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
mars migration um a mass i was like mars

382
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
are we going to mass

383
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,760
sorry people

384
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,640
oh

385
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,120
yeah there's an interesting side topic

386
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,600
here um you might have read the three

387
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
body problem uh science fiction book

388
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
from liu one of the few chinese

389
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
one of the things that it's a chinese

390
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
science fiction novel um

391
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
about how we know aliens are coming in

392
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
400 years and they're going to kill us

393
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
and now now what

394
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
there's an interesting point where at

395
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
some point the the world government

396
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
because at some point they have that

397
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
bans

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
talking

399
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
about leaving the planet to the point

400
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
that they imply mind control to prevent

401
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
that those kind of thoughts because the

402
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,400
thought of leaving the planet is so

403
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
damaging to survival

404
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,120
and of course that's science fiction but

405
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
as a thought you know why we should not

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,280
listen to elon musk because there is no

407
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
planet b and you do not want to go to

408
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
mars b slave

409
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,880
to eek out existence rather than

410
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
fix your here

411
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
and so i thought that was a very

412
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
interesting thought there more

413
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,559
very wet extreme

414
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
precipitation more

415
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
droughts so that's kind of in between

416
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
this one is

417
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
interesting again precipitation

418
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,640
usually what if your atlantic goes to

419
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,200
sudden

420
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
heat waves will bring sudden storms will

421
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,640
bring a lot of water very quickly

422
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
which eventually leaves

423
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,320
but you really need one centimeter of

424
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
water in your living room to really ruin

425
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
your day

426
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
farming land with lots of precipitation

427
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,200
a very short period with very dry ground

428
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
excellent

429
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
gets all the nutrients out of the ground

430
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
and kills the plants and all of that

431
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
right

432
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
and so that means that

433
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,799
there there is a whole

434
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,880
body of literature also

435
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
not just scientifically but more popular

436
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
on property level protection measures

437
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,160
for flooding you can look into that if

438
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
you're interested there's lots of very

439
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
practical advices how do i make sure

440
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,880
that my house

441
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
if it gets flooded is not too badly

442
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
damaged

443
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,960
which means moving your sockets to

444
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
not there but they're not you know

445
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,440
having hard floors having all sorts of

446
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
things there are there are ways you

447
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
could do if you really if this is a real

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
threat to you

449
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
the thing here to worry about is you

450
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
don't have to be flooded by sea to be in

451
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
trouble you just have to be the lowest

452
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,760
part of your neighborhood

453
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
and this is extremely local

454
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,840
if you're in netherlands you have the

455
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
aha and ahmed khan ahn.nl which has

456
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
millimeter level accuracy of all the

457
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,000
surfaces in the country you can exactly

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
look where's your garden compared to the

459
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,720
street

460
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
in terms of water so wherever the

461
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,360
rainwater go

462
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
i look at that first before i decide

463
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,159
buying a house because i'm looking for a

464
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,919
different house because i'll live minus

465
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,120
four and a half

466
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,679
lowest part of the hague no fun

467
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,039
i've never been flooded yet

468
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,520
so if you are in a different country

469
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
check out those height maps

470
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
be prepared if you know you look at the

471
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
map you're like well but i am

472
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,320
20 centimeters taller than most of the

473
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
street i am probably not

474
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
don't have to worry about it

475
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
with a heavy rain

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
at some point but if it's more than x et

477
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
cetera et cetera so these are very

478
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,919
concrete local things

479
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
extinction of species i'll put it here

480
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
with the rest it's

481
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,000
one of those like how do you even

482
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,799
food shortages water shortage

483
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
okay so i'll put in the middle because

484
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
this is the

485
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,919
less of everything

486
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,760
and now that's going to come back and i

487
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,919
think the second part is how do we learn

488
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,720
to have less

489
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,480
yes please that's my inviting yes

490
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,760
[Music]

491
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
yes of course

492
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,960
i'm trying to figure out how to see

493
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
would be how it would affect me

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
not having

495
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
sitting next to me over so yeah

496
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
right right so that's interesting

497
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,039
because now this couples of course the

498
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
supply chains to the infrastructure to

499
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,799
the older things that if you're on a

500
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,120
boat and the bridges are

501
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,559
bent out of shape because of heat and

502
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,360
now you can't leave

503
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
and it's always thinking about those

504
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
processes like what

505
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,559
when we're trying to do this it's really

506
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,120
about what is the obvious never think

507
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,559
about it stuff that i should suddenly

508
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,000
start thinking about it because it might

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,919
not work

510
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,280
a typical example of this in the

511
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
netherlands that i know of i live in the

512
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
west under the hague um

513
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,440
and a lot of logic there as well if you

514
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
flood we will just leave

515
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
right because

516
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
right now not just here too but how

517
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
because the the higg area to give you a

518
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,200
sense has three you know

519
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
highways all of them contain the lowest

520
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,520
spot in the neighborhood so the first

521
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,720
thing that will happen is that those

522
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,240
holes are filled with water

523
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,159
and nobody can leave because no single

524
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,799
vehicle unless you have a freaking boat

525
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,200
in your garden can leave the area

526
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
so the whole logic is i have a disaster

527
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
i believe goes out to the wind as a

528
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,360
strategy strategy has to be if i'm

529
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
dealing with

530
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,159
immediate response with to a threat i

531
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,480
have to stay here

532
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
which is a whole different approach to

533
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
i'll just pack up and leave so okay how

534
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
do i

535
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
set up my emergency response to stick

536
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,439
around

537
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,039
right and

538
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
it's so even the

539
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
security agencies will be like yeah but

540
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
people will evacuate no they won't

541
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
is really nice but if everybody's

542
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
leaving nobody's leaving nobody's

543
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,600
leaving

544
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,840
even if you don't have a spot where it's

545
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
flooded only the first ones will be but

546
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
the rest will stay behind because

547
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,880
they're in traffic jams exactly

548
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,559
so and that's you know we know that

549
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,720
that's a given so then how do i design

550
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,520
around that and

551
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,400
i don't know

552
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
i would say you're safer on a bike

553
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,760
if you're like if you're like really

554
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
after you know the golden rule 72 hours

555
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,559
before

556
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,559
 becomes ugly right you can usually

557
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,880
survive three days the idea is by then

558
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
you're rescued or you're that's

559
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
kind of the

560
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,679
what i know at least from that

561
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,880
literature

562
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,640
so 72 hours stick on or leave and then

563
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
the question is are you then leaving to

564
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
come back

565
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,120
or

566
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,640
you're not coming back

567
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
so which scenario makes sense for your

568
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
situation are you do you expect

569
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
like if you're in a those valleys in

570
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
limburg when the rains hit and your

571
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,320
house was swept away and you just

572
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
escaped you're not coming back because

573
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
you have nowhere to go to because it's

574
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,279
gone now if you know boulder

575
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,400
you're not going to be swept away

576
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
because we don't expect torrents

577
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,200
torrents right it's not going to be

578
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,159
they're not hills they're just going to

579
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,679
be gross

580
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,159
well i can deal with growth right

581
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,520
because i can shovel and i can clean up

582
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
and ever but i cannot deal with

583
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
a building not existing anymore

584
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,559
and so if you're in limburg that's a

585
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,640
worry for you it's not to worry for me

586
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,840
personally but

587
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,799
right um

588
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,200
agricultural water availability prices

589
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
i'll keep that with prices here how are

590
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
we doing with time

591
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,159
because this i need to maybe hurry up

592
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,440
how fast okay let's hurry up a little

593
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
bit heat wave heat stroke that's okay

594
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,480
this is one thanks for this one

595
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
um you're aware of the wet bulb

596
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,640
temperature content notion everybody

597
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
knows about that

598
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
the wet bulb temperature

599
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
yeah for those that don't wet bulb

600
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
temperature is the it's a thermodynamic

601
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
phenomenon at which that's the

602
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,400
temperature humidity combination at

603
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,559
which you cannot cool something down by

604
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,720
evaporation

605
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
right at what does it

606
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,919
i don't remember the exact details

607
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
around 80 humidity and 35 celsius

608
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,760
you will not be able to sweat yourself

609
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,279
cool

610
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,480
a fit human has a few hours to live

611
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,600
in shade

612
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
because your body will simply start

613
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,840
increasing its temperature and you will

614
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,200
die we have had

615
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
a couple of days of that in india this

616
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
year there will be probably a few coming

617
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,039
up in the us in texas this year as well

618
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,279
yes please

619
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
it's hard to tell these things from the

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
news report because this from this

621
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,559
reports because

622
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,559
um a lot of if you see a report that the

623
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
humidity is something

624
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
the assumption such as a place and then

625
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,679
the temperature is essentially such a

626
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,039
replacement if they're not the same time

627
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,840
of day

628
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,520
right right

629
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
so it's a tricky one indeed so that's

630
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,799
it's hard to tell there are calculators

631
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,240
online that will help you with that

632
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,159
there are measurements if you look at

633
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,159
bulk temperature but this is the one at

634
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,679
least that makes me worried long term

635
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,360
because if you start having periods

636
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,400
let's say in

637
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,840
you know india and places like that

638
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
tropical parts of lots of people that

639
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,640
are humid

640
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,000
if you have these

641
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
conditions for weeks on end

642
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,200
there will be a lot of very dead people

643
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,039
and that's just terrifying but because

644
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,240
if you cannot hide if there's no

645
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,799
mechanical cooling now for netherlands

646
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,400
is that the likely scenario not yet

647
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
even outside of uh more tropical

648
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
countries like i was worried about it in

649
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,719
the uk from my grandmother

650
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,159
elderly excellent again context yes so

651
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,000
okay do i if i'm thinking about this

652
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
prolonged heat waves what do i do with

653
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
grandma

654
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
right do you have a plan for that i

655
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
literally just went to my mother-in-law

656
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,200
and delivered a couple of fans

657
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,720
and wet towels to her before we left for

658
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,799
camp because we were like well it's

659
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,120
going to be hot and you're 80.

660
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,039
one meter below ground is very cool

661
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,639
for grandma

662
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,639
do you really want me to answer that

663
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,200
okay i have

664
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
droughts drying dying woods burning

665
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
woods this is

666
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
if you're in a forest area yeah that's a

667
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,799
good point see i don't even think about

668
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,720
forest fires because i'm in the middle

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
of a freaking swamp

670
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,399
but if you're not

671
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
let's put that on the droughts

672
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
this one is of course we've seen it

673
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
a lot last couple of years

674
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
what's your plan for that do you have a

675
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
i have no idea i mean i always think

676
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
about floods i never think about forest

677
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
fires for my personality so anybody who

678
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,720
has that context yeah i mean if you have

679
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
a house defensible space is the main

680
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
thing making sure that there's like 100

681
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,399
meters all around your house where

682
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
there's no trees or flammable bushes or

683
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
anything

684
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,919
and then

685
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,679
leaving early so that if there is

686
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,120
if there's fire you need to leave you

687
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,320
want to be out of there as soon as

688
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,240
possible so that firefighters can

689
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
actually come in and right work at least

690
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,720
then you need to chop wood yeah

691
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
well you need to do the defensible space

692
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,360
thing way ahead of time yeah

693
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
you can in california for instance where

694
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
i used to live if you live in the

695
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,480
mountains no one has no one has like a

696
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,760
cabin next to the forest anymore

697
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,679
being safe it's you have a cabin and

698
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
then you have 100 meters of grass and

699
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
then the forest is way over there

700
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
because if the forest is next to your

701
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
house before experiencing your

702
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,360
households

703
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,799
right and what you should just said is

704
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,240
something you're doing ahead of time you

705
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
don't do that while it's burning you had

706
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,360
to come here sure tropical countries

707
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
design courses you learn about putting

708
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
banana plants

709
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
yes

710
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
banana plants permaculture the excellent

711
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,159
idea so if you're in a situation where

712
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,240
you can afford permaculture

713
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,520
for a lot of these things probably a

714
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
good idea but that's also not something

715
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
you do

716
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,399
overnight that's something you do years

717
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,600
ahead so

718
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
if you keep in good shape in australia

719
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,039
is like a real thing like for decades

720
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,840
decades

721
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,000
if you chop the trees then the carbon

722
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,720
storage is gone

723
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
there is

724
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
just to make a comment on that

725
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,960
thinking across scales here is very hard

726
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,480
when we're talking about 100 meters of

727
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
forest around your house

728
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
whatever

729
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,799
we need to worry about hundreds of

730
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
thousands of square kilometers of amazon

731
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,320
we need to worry about oceans because a

732
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
lot of the oxygen and all that stuff is

733
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,640
oceans not so much that and there's

734
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
always that trade-off like

735
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
and i don't know how to deal with that

736
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
but there is the local i'm emitting

737
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,399
something because in the long run

738
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,640
or but skills are hard and planetary

739
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,919
skills are

740
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,080
not something we as individuals know how

741
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
to think about

742
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,279
you know sixteen thousand kilometers

743
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,120
that's sixty thousand kilometers that's

744
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,919
not

745
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,840
a quantity you can think about

746
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,520
six billion people what does that even

747
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
mean that number

748
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,360
like 150 i can understand

749
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
not six billion

750
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,919
i've had some more floods there lots of

751
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,840
nature vegetation

752
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,600
high altitude forests yeah that's if

753
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
you're in mountains that's the other

754
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,440
worry i'll add it over there

755
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
um

756
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,480
i've done quite a lot of stuff on

757
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
flooding and flash floods and if you

758
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
have no vegetation on mountains flash

759
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,200
floods will break things up really bad

760
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,440
um

761
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
there's a scary paper we wrote about st

762
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,919
martin and their floods where we show

763
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,919
how rich people push the poor people up

764
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,919
the hills and because they don't own the

765
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,960
land they're not allowed to have

766
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,399
concrete foundations because concrete

767
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,320
foundations means property therefore

768
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,919
you're in a shack and you're on a steep

769
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,360
hill and you get swiped away every

770
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,720
couple of years by typhoon

771
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,799
lesson is don't be poor that's kind of

772
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,080
no

773
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
yeah sorry i just get a bit cynical but

774
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,639
that's um worst

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,840
can

776
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,000
can somebody read what was that urban

777
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,120
heat island

778
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,600
overnight temperatures not falling low

779
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,559
enough for recovery

780
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,559
fantastic thanks for that so

781
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,559
uh not everybody by the suburbanite i

782
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,600
keep on forgetting that because they

783
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,720
live in burbs if you are a city dweller

784
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
what happens right overheated grid

785
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,799
grid goes down if you're lucky to have

786
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,640
air conditioned now you have nothing now

787
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,919
what and you and yes the heat island is

788
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,640
very powerful

789
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
so for example i have neighbors who love

790
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
concrete for some

791
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,919
strange reasons have gardens full of

792
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600
concrete mine is full of wood chips bark

793
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,240
and plants my garden is literally 10

794
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
degrees cooler than theirs

795
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,200
and these are small things you can do

796
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,880
just make sure there's no concrete

797
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
around you if you can afford not to have

798
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,679
that

799
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
and if you have

800
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,440
if you know flat do you have plants do

801
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,000
because living things will suck up heat

802
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,279
tropical weather okay tree is replaced

803
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
by the new um

804
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,640
tropical weather trees will be replaced

805
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,120
with a new

806
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
new species right

807
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,760
um invasive species in general

808
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
how much do we care

809
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
if you are exposed to kudzu for example

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,799
in the us and the kudzu comes and covers

811
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,080
everything you own and kills everything

812
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
then it's a problem

813
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,399
in holland in australia

814
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,399
frogs

815
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,000
we got our crabs in holland but they're

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,279
pretty tasty even though you're not

817
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,399
you're not allowed to catch them

818
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,399
thanks for that that's the one there was

819
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
a few years back i was working at the

820
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,120
center of environment in university of

821
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,559
leyden and they brought in somebody with

822
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,120
malaria this person was 80 years old

823
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,240
they have never left the country in

824
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,159
their life they happen to live close to

825
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,000
scripple

826
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,760
i wonder what the happened and that

827
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,360
was no good because like how do you you

828
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,399
know

829
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,480
elephants will not stow away on planes

830
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
accidentally and spread out

831
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
right mosquitoes will

832
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
and so that means okay so

833
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,200
fine that's

834
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,360
there are now swampy context that is a

835
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,720
real worry

836
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,880
dengue yellow fever all those scary

837
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,399
things do we know to recognize it

838
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
so maybe you should just read up on it

839
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,440
or have a little booklet somewhere in

840
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
your cupboard like oh that's how it

841
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,840
looks like and if the doctor is like i

842
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,960
don't know what's wrong with you well

843
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
maybe

844
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
okay

845
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
droughts i have

846
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,720
droughts on high sand areas i've put it

847
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,519
with drought same there

848
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,840
lots

849
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,000
of please

850
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
i can't read it i'm just hoping somebody

851
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
recognizes their knows what this was

852
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
so what

853
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,879
i think but it's not mine

854
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,000
anybody recognize their own

855
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,839
lots of rain right so that's the uh

856
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,839
storms that put on the storms that's the

857
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,520
same as that

858
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,119
we are not allowed to go outside during

859
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,919
heavy storms

860
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,359
that's an interesting one you see this

861
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
this this happened to me just last

862
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,359
november with the storms i saw my

863
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,199
neighbor's roof fly off

864
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
and i was like oh i'll go outside and

865
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,560
you know tell them because they can't

866
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,079
see the roof i can and my wife was like

867
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,639
are you insane

868
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
and then she was like and she was right

869
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,199
because as i was about to go outside i

870
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,800
see bricks falling down because i live

871
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,239
in a narrow alleyway

872
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,240
and i see bricks coming down from his

873
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,640
roof like how about i wait for about an

874
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,119
hour bef so and then go tell him

875
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,880
because there's no point in getting

876
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,400
killed while i'm trying to tell him his

877
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
roof is down

878
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,160
notice the pressure change probably but

879
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,839
i mean he was out you know we were out

880
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
there but that's there is this almost

881
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,560
you know how far do you reach out and

882
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,160
but you don't you know

883
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,359
again

884
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,880
save yourself first right because you

885
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,000
you can't help other people sorry

886
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
i actually don't have his phone number

887
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,680
which is an excellent point socially

888
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
do you know your neighbors do you have

889
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
your neighbor's phone number yes

890
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,760
you do that's smart who else has their

891
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,079
neighbor

892
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,440
okay so but that's less than half

893
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
yeah he's like two houses he's in the

894
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,960
back i don't i don't know him and i see

895
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
about i saw about less than half of the

896
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,760
hands

897
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
lesson learned there local community

898
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
right

899
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,920
at the

900
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,359
first aid

901
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,760
center here there's the fire exclamation

902
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,359
mark joke

903
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,440
from the id cloud that you if you see a

904
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
fire you have to send an email with fire

905
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,710
right

906
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,280
[Music]

907
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,800
i will put this one here this one says

908
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
farming will move to more dry crops

909
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,640
grains and legumes that's another

910
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,720
long-term adaptation

911
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,440
swiss glaciers melting

912
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,640
i'll put that under

913
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
where was it

914
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,439
sorry

915
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,320
floods and droughts oh fun let's put it

916
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
tall buildings covered with green that's

917
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
a solution i'll put that there

918
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
farm turned into water buffers that's a

919
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
solution that's great

920
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
more greenhouse especially

921
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,040
vertical a solution

922
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,160
farming

923
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
done by machines that's a thing there

924
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,560
mass migration is a social we'll keep

925
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,000
that there

926
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
flooding we have flooding

927
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,680
we had droughts flooding was there

928
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,760
more civil action great let's put that

929
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,040
there

930
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,440
i have

931
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,520
wasp take over work from bees that's an

932
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,599
interesting one that's ecosystem

933
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,160
function extreme heat torrential rains

934
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,320
flooding okay

935
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,480
um okay so in retrospect thanks for your

936
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
input we see

937
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,440
oh there's one more oh thank you uh

938
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
less local fish that's

939
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,119
great so where do i put that food the

940
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,079
cost of water food

941
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
what do we see what what have we seen

942
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,599
let's look at this we have our droughts

943
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
we have our

944
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,839
fire

945
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,240
again immediate problems coupled with

946
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
storms often

947
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,560
we talked about how to what do you deal

948
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,760
with that can you evacuate can you not

949
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,359
evacuate

950
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,040
um i also heard very different things

951
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,000
right oh i mean in a city heat waves are

952
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
different than if i'm in a dry land if

953
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,119
i'm in the mountains um

954
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
there is the species food aspect which

955
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,640
is

956
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
something we'll have to address and this

957
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,040
is the one where

958
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,920
being

959
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
this one is hard not to be naive about

960
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,440
because you cannot

961
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
the amount of okay so if you are a

962
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,839
hunter hunter gatherer

963
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,480
uh uk which has about 80 plus million

964
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
people can support about 80 000 people

965
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,040
they have seen some papers claiming that

966
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,640
that's a very significant difference in

967
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,119
numbers so the idea i'll go in the woods

968
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,480
in

969
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,800
southwest of the hague

970
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
and gather my food

971
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
what the like of course not

972
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
like just know these concentrations

973
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
don't work so how do you think about

974
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,640
things like providing your own food if

975
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,040
you know that you either

976
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
physically are unable to do so because

977
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,560
it takes hectares per person

978
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,839
and lots of work and years of

979
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,160
preparation and skill which we

980
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,760
most i.t people i guess don't have i

981
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,520
mean i certainly don't

982
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
i mean you know it's a job right it's a

983
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,160
skill you need to know how to grow food

984
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,280
and

985
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,599
my radishes get eaten by snails um

986
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,079
how and you know please

987
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,839
yes thanks this is going back one step

988
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:00,960
but i just want to clarify when you're

989
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
mentioning about the uk about not

990
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,119
necessarily having the resources to

991
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,599
defeat everyone is that do you mean like

992
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,200
because of a current production locally

993
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,720
we have now or do you mean like even if

994
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
we utilize the land better

995
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,040
the publications that i've seen were

996
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
estimating if you are a hunter-gatherer

997
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,640
if you literally live off the land by

998
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,240
just looking around trying to catch an

999
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
animal collect berries

1000
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,839
the carrying capacity of the ecosystem

1001
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,040
to support human energy requirements

1002
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
of the entire country is about 80 000

1003
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
people

1004
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
this this assumes no agriculture

1005
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
it's like the extreme we are literally

1006
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,119
just bands of roving humans doing

1007
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
the good old days

1008
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
yeah when you go to get to be a ripe old

1009
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,520
age of 30 right

1010
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,560
now i mean okay so

1011
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,599
let's move this and then

1012
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,598
so then

1013
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
okay so that's ecological environmental

1014
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,078
and of course my laptop went to sleep

1015
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
okay so what i would like to do now is

1016
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,560
to

1017
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,599
keep

1018
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,920
also in due of time to

1019
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
repeat this exercise

1020
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,079
but now bring it closer to home to us

1021
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,440
geeks and think about the

1022
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
techno-political

1023
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
aspect of things

1024
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,400
right so this is the stuff that is just

1025
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
whether it's going to be climate it's

1026
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,760
going to be things that hit us

1027
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,400
um let's try to think about the social

1028
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
governmental

1029
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,760
and the things around us the machines

1030
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,720
the software the

1031
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,280
papers please aspect of things

1032
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
what do we think in a world which is

1033
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
going through these kind of

1034
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,640
repeated

1035
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,560
frequent shocks that we

1036
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,160
either can

1037
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,400
handle but not so often or we never had

1038
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,079
to deal with before

1039
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,839
such as long-term extreme heat in the

1040
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,200
netherlands we're not built for that we

1041
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,400
built for

1042
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,720
wet and cold not for that

1043
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
um or like what you've seen in texas uh

1044
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,359
you're not built for freezing right you

1045
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,119
have everything set up to keep the the

1046
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,480
heat out not to keep it in so they went

1047
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,560
terribly wrong when they had

1048
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,230
weeks of freezing weather

1049
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,440
[Music]

1050
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,400
so let's think about

1051
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
what kind of world if this is happening

1052
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,240
if i've been flooded for the fifth time

1053
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,760
this year

1054
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,960
or the

1055
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,200
seventh storm in three months has

1056
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,640
brought down again the roof and i'm

1057
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,359
trying to get a guy to come fix it but

1058
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,960
he's fixing his own roof and everybody's

1059
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,200
roof is broken now now what

1060
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,040
what does how does this look like are we

1061
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
does government come show up does

1062
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,680
military come show up

1063
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
it's a question that write it down but

1064
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,319
it does

1065
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,960
with the tornado there the roofs were

1066
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
are not fixed for like

1067
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,760
five or six months

1068
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
please write that down because i would

1069
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
like to gather every and then you can

1070
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,839
put there like very long or no help from

1071
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,280
if that's the world how you think that's

1072
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
a thing

1073
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,400
uh also think in

1074
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,240
infrastructures the systems around you

1075
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,880
the roads the power grid can it handle

1076
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,920
it

1077
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,960
yes is that a useful exercise

1078
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,400
please

1079
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
so my question is please again in the

1080
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,319
same way like we did identify things you

1081
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,720
expect to have to deal with in the

1082
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
techno social government

1083
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
world

1084
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,599
do i still have internet

1085
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,359
uh

1086
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,520
do i have electricity do i

1087
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,960
can i call the police if something goes

1088
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,720
wrong do i think that's a thing maybe it

1089
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
is maybe it's maybe you think it's not i

1090
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,040
would like to hear that um

1091
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,280
and then i think we

1092
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,359
have a break and then see use that to

1093
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,960
think about okay so what do we do then

1094
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,880
okay take a few minutes

1095
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,720
if you need more pens

1096
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
yes my pen disappeared i don't know i

1097
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
have

1098
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
um

1099
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
oh

1100
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,800
so no drinking water it's more

1101
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
the previous exercise i don't know if if

1102
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,440
you if you're drinking water for you

1103
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
means going to the local river cleaning

1104
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,280
it up and drinking it then that's that

1105
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,599
but it is i open the town

1106
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,599
and i hope that if the water company did

1107
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,839
their job or is able to do their job

1108
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,720
then that belongs here

1109

[Music]

1110
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,720
but also think

1111
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,160
and again this is hard because it's

1112
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,480
multiple scales but also more

1113
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,720
general things like do i still have

1114
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,520
access to tech am i allowed to

1115
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,450
do things

because you only have so much food and

1122
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,040
you have to make sure everyone is fed

1123
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,319
and you can only do that when you

1124
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,200
provide it by metrics

1159
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,599
i realized i don't want to be copy is

1160
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,960
tearing off my paper so i'll just

1161
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,040
reorganize it on this board just to not

1162
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,720
waste more paper

1163
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,839
okay um i'll i'll move a few things down

1164
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,359
so that i can start up grouping it

1165
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,880
together let's just start here

1166
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,920
no internet no electricity no phone okay

1167
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,079
no

1168
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,000
no telecom right

1169
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,240
supermarkets empty or closed survivor of

1170
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,759
the fittest that's bleak

1171
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,640
no water from the tap yes

1172
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,960
let's just talk about this because i've

1173
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,160
seen it a few times already the

1174
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
what's plausible

1175
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,000
temporary another thing it's not right

1176
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
but just think about it so we can there

1177
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,040
is the

1178
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
something terrible happened things are

1179
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,520
disrupted is this a likely long-term

1180
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
thing

1181
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,400
it's a short term

1182
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,880
right which is fine so let's then try to

1183
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
keep them short i try to put a short

1184
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,880
term here in the long term there

1185
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,599
so the the long term question is how do

1186
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,720
i prepare for a unpleasant

1187
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,880
relatively short-term disruption

1188
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,480
versus is it really

1189
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,839
should i be preparing for the world

1190
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,440
where there's never more drinking water

1191
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,480
from my tap

1192
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,200
living in a western rich country is that

1193
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
a plausible scenario please

1194
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,510
so when i'm thinking about this yeah

1195
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,359
[Music]

1196
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,400
i mean if it happens now i think we will

1197
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,680
be fine

1198
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,319
german government says be prepared for

1199
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,040
10 days right

1200
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,800
10 days without running right

1201
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,359
we can back up everything

1202
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,839
we have emergency scenarios but it just

1203
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,720
happens a lot of times i mean at some

1204
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,640
point or

1205
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,480
we won't have the money

1206
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,800
and the backup solutions

1207
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,040
because the backup solutions will have

1208
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,800
run out yes and so i think at some point

1209
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,830
there's no backup solution

1210
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,800
[Music]

1211
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,920
so that's an interesting thought let's

1212
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,079
run with that so you're you are saying

1213
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,440
um

1214
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,200
in a world where this keeps on happening

1215
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,319
and you still have a functional

1216
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,680
government that's an assumption you have

1217
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,920
a government that somehow still is there

1218
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,319
at some point they can't afford it and

1219
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,839
if your government that cares is trying

1220
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,760
to do its best what is then the do they

1221
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,400
say well no money or

1222
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
interesting company you have over there

1223
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,880
that's now mine

1224
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,520
i mean i'm not do you think that's

1225
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,440
plausible yeah

1226
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,040
because that's a thing where

1227
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,920
again

1228
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,480
i come from a country that has had war

1229
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,559
and that's a lot of these things are war

1230
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,880
situations and then it's like well too

1231
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,920
bad

1232
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,880
democracy out of the window we will do

1233
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,200
this this is our now ours and you will

1234
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,559
work

1235
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,160
pay how do you mean pay you will you are

1236
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,839
working you are going to be digging the

1237
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,040
channel you will be fixing that pipe now

1238
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,720
the end

1239
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,480
and so that's fine

1240
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,839
no it's not fine

1241
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,160
but so in that scenario which i think is

1242
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,839
a very likely one where you're like

1243
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,440
repeatedly being stressed you cannot

1244
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,559
cope

1245
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,480
you naturally i think and i'm curious

1246
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,400
what you think end up in a very

1247
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
territorian

1248
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,559
government situation by necessity not

1249
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,760
because they're necessarily evil

1250
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,960
also people will help each other

1251
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,559
probably people will help each other and

1252
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,760
and will

1253
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,359
uh and there will be people who are

1254
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,520
fixing the pipes yes

1255
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,559
even without salary correct

1256
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,760
i think that

1257
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,119
that

1258
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,960
in the situation where everyone is

1259
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,839
suffering that there will be people who

1260
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,200
who will who will work uh for others

1261
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,559
that's exactly right and we know that

1262
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,079
we've seen that in war situations we've

1263
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,079
seen in disaster situations people are

1264
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,319
generally decent

1265
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,480
in general

1266
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,079
it's the few extremes that are annoying

1267
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,240
but you're right so it is always that

1268
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,720
how far do we believe that our societies

1269
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,240
will be able to

1270
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,400
stretch that and that you cannot keep up

1271
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,599
doing because you have to eat at some

1272
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,720
point and you can't go fix other

1273
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,240
people's pipes while your kids are

1274
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,880
hungry so how does that gonna work i

1275
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,960
don't know but that's uh

1276
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,839
right

1277
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,920
perhaps what had happened is that there

1278
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,880
are not enough people who are uh with

1279
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,000
the the skills to uh to do that kind of

1280
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,800
job excellent of course we have uh here

1281
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,400
we have a really

1282
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,520
a society of managers and yeah well i

1283
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,319
don't know but uh i think most managers

1284
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:15,599
are are not capable of fixing uh

1285
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,079
some some water pipes you're absolutely

1286
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,359
right and this is i'm glad you brought

1287
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,960
that up so that

1288
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,520
as a long-term strategy that's in our

1289
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,640
part two

1290
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,119
um yes

1291
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,240
times of please

1292
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,760
there is always a need to

1293
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
restructure everything so if you are

1294
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,200
even if you are a manager you will

1295
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,079
become a plumber out of the needs

1296
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,760
guess what you have to have a plumber

1297
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,760
who can teach you what you need to know

1298
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,240
yeah yeah but that's if they're all gone

1299
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,960
or if they're all busy elsewhere it's

1300
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,200
it's no it's no option

1301
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,559
and you have to

1302
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,240
to teach yourself

1303
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,200
yeah but

1304
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,000
yeah

1305
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,760
what i've seen during the times of

1306
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,839
crisis or during the times of war that

1307
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,520
there are always people who can organize

1308
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,440
themselves because the government is

1309
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,200
failing or the government is occupied

1310
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,720
with something else

1311
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,599
so yeah like you said that there is some

1312
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,720
decency among human beings still

1313
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,480
the question always will be scale but

1314
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,920
it's a very good question can you scale

1315
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,280
it up you saw it indeed in germany

1316
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,440
for example last year

1317
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,000
during the flooding yeah

1318
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,559
and my big question for me always is

1319
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,240
does this scale up because this works in

1320
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,359
an emergency in a city in the region

1321
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,839
what if whole europe is like that

1322
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,359
what if whole world is like that how how

1323
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,520
far can you stretch this i don't know

1324
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,040
we do know that from there's a lot of

1325
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
literature on the aging problem of lack

1326
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,079
of skills we see that in all sorts of

1327
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,079
uh you know metro comp energy network

1328
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,079
companies like fine i'll build that if i

1329
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,839
can get enough people which they don't

1330
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,839
because first we're having you know low

1331
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,760
birth rates especially europe and who

1332
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,599
wants to be a tech because you can make

1333
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,200
more money as a manager

1334
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,559
but so that's you know in terms of

1335
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,240
skills let's summarize this and then

1336
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,280
have a break

1337
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,720
force degrowth very interesting

1338
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,960
notice the worst word forced and you

1339
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,480
know what that means a government that

1340
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,359
says

1341
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,760
you shall not have this now

1342
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,680
like swimming heating swimming pools in

1343
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,119
germany

1344
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,720
or

1345
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,799
forced vegan diet

1346
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,559
somebody wrote environmentally sound

1347
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,920
will you be voting for the political

1348
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,680
party that says everybody must be vegan

1349
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,200
this is literally the only pla only

1350
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,799
place where the answer is yay i think

1351
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,960
but again think about it right so in an

1352
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,799
environment that you normally live in

1353
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,880
how will your neighbors react to

1354
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,960
something like that i suspect not very

1355
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,040
favorably

1356
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,079
is it smart probably yes yes

1357
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,599
it won't be an option anymore because

1358
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,960
there won't be any animals left there

1359
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,160
might not be

1360
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,799
yeah but that's it

1361
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,079
right

1362
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,000
so i have no power no fresh water no

1363
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,119
internet memes oh no put it here

1364
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,359
china plus eco-fascism state power

1365
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,960
concentrating cities

1366
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,079
that's interesting one city

1367
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,319
concentration that's humanity has been

1368
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,839
doing that we are moving to cities more

1369
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:08,960
and more

1370
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,559
countryside is for outcasts and

1371
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,319
corporate food yeah somebody been

1372
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,440
playing

1373
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,839
cyberpunk

1374
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,079
2077 i have but yeah that's

1375
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,319
right

1376
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,760
it's interesting to observe what china

1377
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,440
is doing because they have compared to

1378
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
most other countries an exceptionally

1379
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,760
high degree of ability to

1380
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,119
organize

1381
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,359
you can disagree with the methods

1382
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,000
extensively

1383
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,598
you cannot argue with the results

1384
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,880
they also i remember that friday

1385
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,559
that's when you're nerd like me who's

1386
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,760
worries about these things there was a

1387
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,119
friday that the chinese government

1388
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,280
announced from today on you can only buy

1389
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,040
neodymium magnets

1390
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,440
we will not sell you neodymium metal or

1391
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,520
neodym ore

1392
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,839
now neodium your nerds you know

1393
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,400
they have bought

1394
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,119
most south africa south american mines

1395
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,799
they have priced out all the american

1396
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,240
mines and made sure that they are

1397
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,720
bankrupt and a full monopoly on the odin

1398
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
right now and before the us industry has

1399
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,480
reestablished itself that's not gonna

1400
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,440
happen

1401
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,200
and they basically said no more or for

1402
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,920
you

1403
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,359
and withdraw ore from american

1404
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,799
production killed the american

1405
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,400
production of the odium and they

1406
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,040
monopolized fully

1407
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,440
products now

1408
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,440
long term very smart i mean it's it's

1409
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,760
evil as hell and i wish i could pull it

1410
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,319
off it's sort of as in right i'm being

1411
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,599
flippant but you get it right so it's

1412
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,960
really effective

1413
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,040
and western governments are probably not

1414
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,559
able to pull that kind of coordination

1415
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:41,599
off

1416
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,680
for better or worse

1417
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,680
i mean the only way you can do it is you

1418
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,680
have to be willing to like maintain

1419
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,040
the capacity

1420
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,839
right at cost be low cost at the

1421
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,720
societal investment exactly and no

1422
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,559
western capitalist environment allows

1423
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,079
for that

1424
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,119
right

1425
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,440
absence of social services after major

1426
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,760
disasters capacity right again i'll keep

1427
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,559
it here with the this is short term i'll

1428
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,559
move that there because that's the long

1429
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,359
term

1430
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,960
no internet i'll move that there we

1431
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,480

1432
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,240

there is a um one second there there's a

1463
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,760
science fiction book from uh what's his

1464

1467
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,359
some somebody some does something and

1468
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,599
then four billion people die

1469
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,760
instantly because of some implants or

1470
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
something and then he talks about

1471
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,280
ecological disaster of having four

1472
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,520
billion corpses on the planet

1473
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,400
it's

1474
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,079
it's not fun

1475
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,200
it really made me think of that but

1476
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,319
there is that like what do you do that

1477
00:59:58,319 --> 00:59:59,920
biomass that just

1478
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,359
okay

1479
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,720
jesus christ talk about this current

1480
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,559
conversation come in

1481
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,440
sorry

1482
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,920
please oh yeah sorry apologies okay so

1483
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,160
uh i had the second no internet one yep

1484
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,839
um and i drilled down a little bit more

1485
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,640
because it's also you know no netflix no

1486
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,000
entertainment people go so crazy crazy

1487
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,760
uh and i think that one of the reasons

1488
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,920
that you know corona wasn't so bad was

1489
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,760
that everybody sat in front of the tv

1490
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,000
and watched tv but what if there's no tv

1491
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,119
what if people have to read books all of

1492
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,559
a sudden or

1493
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,000
play cards

1494
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,040
um

1495
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
it's i'm curious what you think about

1496
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,359
interesting that scenario one of my

1497
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,920
buddies is a american divorce lawyer in

1498
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,960
florida

1499
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,799
and he said the

1500
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,960
first thing that happened uh like

1501
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,400
after the first half year of covet is

1502
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,319
divorce rates when the run down that

1503
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,760
dropped like a rock

1504
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,960
and first everybody was like oh but

1505
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,160
that's amazing and then they realized oh

1506
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,000
no that's terrible

1507
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,280
because people don't dare to get

1508
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,359
divorced and so people stay in abusive

1509
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,119
relationships because it's so much

1510
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,440
insecurity they can't afford to leave

1511
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,359
and it's actually a very bad thing

1512
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,119
and so indeed the what they've seen is

1513
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,640
divorces went up

1514
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,640
battery and domestic violence cases have

1515
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,079
gone up

1516
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,000
and it's been i mean you can just tell

1517
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,920
you just got the graphs

1518
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
so yeah there's it's and then you also

1519
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,280
know who's essential right it's the

1520
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,880
people on right

1521
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,319
yeah

1522
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,000
kids miss lots of school that's a very

1523
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,760
important long-term thing what do we do

1524
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,280
when we have systematic disruption

1525
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,799
education

1526
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,400
right we've seen that now with kovid

1527
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,920
it's not a good thing i mean have kids

1528
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,079
at school it was no fun

1529
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,359
it's not good for them they're

1530
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,960
de-socialized they need to re-learn how

1531
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,920
to be

1532
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
friends it's not good

1533
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,400
authoritative governments no democracy

1534
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,119
yeah that's put that there

1535
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,720
no clean water infrastructure breakdown

1536
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,280
that keep that there

1537
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
people noticing the limits failures of

1538
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,200
capitalism and infinite growth yeah

1539
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,040
that's

1540
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,559
let's hope well people know this

1541
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,400
uh if water becomes scarce no concrete

1542
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,640
no construction

1543
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,720
somebody there

1544
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,880
government restrict to buy items so we

1545
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,780
put that on the government control

1546
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,480
[Music]

1547
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,240
it's one of those things again

1548
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,240
people were bitching when eu limited the

1549
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,000
maximum power of a

1550
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
water cattle and of the vacuum cleaner i

1551
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,960
don't know if you caught that at some

1552
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,000
point right

1553
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,440
it's like oh

1554
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,359
my freedoms and i need a three kilowatt

1555
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,559
cattle

1556
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,960
do you

1557
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,520
right

1558
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,640
um technological development pause

1559
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,640
so that's interesting we do know also

1560
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,160
that

1561
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,000
humanity never wastes a good crisis in

1562
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,280
general

1563
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,359
and that's a very interesting one so

1564
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,680
does it mean that development stops

1565
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,599
if you look at major wars they were

1566
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,680
major major pushes because then yolo

1567
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,319
anything goes what now ethics

1568
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,280
and so

1569
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,960
as terrible as it is a lot of the

1570
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,359
advances happened because of

1571
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,280
nazis locking up jews and experimenting

1572
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,440
which is terrible but we found out

1573
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,799
things you would never found out about

1574
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,240
because they're extremely unethical to

1575
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,160
test

1576
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,839
right nasa is half former

1577
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,839
rocket scientist

1578
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:10,720
right

1579
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,839
but it's also not unheard of

1580
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,359
that has happened i've actually actually

1581
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,280
done a massive student student with with

1582
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,079
some archaeologists who looked at a 13

1583
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,400
000 years ago there was a explosion of

1584
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,720
volcano in northwestern europe somewhere

1585
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,640
that covered ash changed local climate

1586
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,960
and they have historic records of tribes

1587
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,559
forgetting how to make bows and arrows

1588
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,319
right and and the interesting thing

1589
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,599
there is and that's the thing that makes

1590
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,559
me really worried is the how much tech

1591
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,200
you need to make tech to make tech

1592
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,039
right how much

1593
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,799
i have to be able to make steel if i

1594
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,880
ever want to make a chip fab

1595
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,400
even though i don't have steel goes into

1596
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,559
it but the layers of stuff i need to be

1597
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,640
able to and that bootstrapping once you

1598
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,480
start losing certain levels will be very

1599
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,000
interesting

1600
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,160
especially if the you know rare and

1601
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,760
special things are required

1602
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,559
so that's interesting so do you have a

1603
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,640
chip fab low level one in the hacker

1604
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,640
space

1605
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,720
they didn't

1606
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,640
use those in america because they don't

1607
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,960
know how to use them right

1608
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,799
and there's a lot a lot of fantastic

1609
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,039
knowledge locked in society which then

1610
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,440
starts becoming difficult to access

1611
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,079
so when we talk about robust strategies

1612
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,079
do you run a backup of wikipedia on your

1613
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,820
home server just because

1614
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,440
[Music]

1615
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,319
you know

1616
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,280
yeah

1617
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,520
maybe you do because you just want to be

1618
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,720
have access to acknowledge if you don't

1619
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,319
have internet

1620
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,720
no drinking water that's

1621
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,640
on the emergency stuff

1622
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,799
because we have no internet due to heat

1623
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,240
energy shortage

1624
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
cars cannot drive because they need

1625
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,400
internet oh god yeah

1626
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,880
there's that

1627
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,559
not maybe we had the berry okay so what

1628
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,720
have you seen

1629
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,839
yes please

1630
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,839

yeah yes thanks for this guys the which

1632
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,280

1633
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,520
okay so we have here no food water

1634
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,799
internet no

1635
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,599
medical right

1636
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,880
thanks for that there is um

1637
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,440
especially when you are taking life

1638
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,359
preserving chronicle education that you

1639
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,240
need to keep on taking

1640
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,960
that's a thing

1641
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,400
i just want to share a story of just how

1642
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,400
bad this gets it sir i take certain

1643
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,640
pills that i at that time could not stop

1644
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,480
i have to continue because side effects

1645
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,079
for psychosis and suicide which is like

1646
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,319
you don't want to just do that

1647
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,520
um

1648
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,760
it's not you know it's one of those

1649
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,039
extreme things but

1650
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,079
and

1651
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,839
i'm a professor at the university my

1652
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,160

i can pull strings

1656
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,000

just ran out i'm like i have two more

1661
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,760
days and then then i go crazy

1662
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,440
we don't have them because supply chain

1663
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,000
brexit something happened it took me

1664
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,440
48 hours to get it organized and i have

1665
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,359
a psychiatrist in the family who can

1666
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,640
write a recipe

1667
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,240
i have it fedexed and i'm rich enough to

1668
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,599
afford that

1669
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,119
and it was a lot of effort a lot of

1670
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,559
stress

1671
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,240
being at the top of the

1672
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,200
i can push it off pyramid

1673
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,720
and now you're a single mom with two

1674
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,440
kids no job

1675
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,319
black

1676
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,720
muslim

1677
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,720
you're laughing right but that's no i

1678
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,480
know but that's

1679
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,079
that's really bad and then you ran out

1680
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,920
of life-saving medication and doctor

1681
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,960
goes

1682
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,720
i want to help you but now what and

1683
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,480
that's that's that to me was really

1684
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,559
sobering it's just how much effort it

1685
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,920
took me to to fix something that's

1686
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,319
extremely easy for me to fix compared to

1687
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,799
most people

1688
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
like holy cow how do you even

1689
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,319
how do we as society deal with such

1690
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,160
things and you know so i stopped taking

1691
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,359
that vacation i think different ones

1692
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,359
that i can stop if i have to

1693
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,240
that's an adaptation that's you know

1694
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,960
no transport

1695
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,480
obviously

1696
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,790
absolutely so if uh

1697
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,480
[Music]

1698
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,960
if you have the abilities you can you

1699
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,920
[Music]

1700
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,799
exactly so exactly so then question is

1701
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,640
if you're in that situation what is what

1702
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,118
can you do

1703
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,799
i don't know

1704
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,160
i just want to raise that point and to

1705
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,160
really because you know your local

1706
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,839
situation but what what can i do and it

1707
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,280
does you might want to have some

1708
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,039
supplies you want to have some

1709
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,119
buffers if you can

1710
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,000
what in the long run

1711
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,839
so

1712
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,760
a related thing is how do how do we

1713
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,520
learn from these things

1714
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,760
so we mentioned germany before and

1715
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,720
people

1716
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,880
helping and there was this flooding

1717
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,480
and then the insurance companies paid

1718
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,400
out and the government decided we're

1719
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,479
going to rebuild everything just like it

1720
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,640
was before and really just like it was

1721
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,600
before in the same areas that flooded

1722
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,759
we're going to rebuild these houses so

1723
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:25,759
that way when the next storm comes we

1724
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,839
can rebuild them again

1725
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,600
of course telling people to move you

1726
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,279
know go someplace else is also kind of

1727
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,719
mean but

1728
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,479
it seems to me like we had this great

1729
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,080
effort there was

1730
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,520
a horrible situation people came

1731
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,799
together and then we didn't learn

1732
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,479
anything

1733
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,479
but we can rebuild

1734
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,560
in a different way rebuild in different

1735
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,000
ways

1736
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,359
we can rebuild the buildings but also

1737
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,000
build some

1738
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,080
there are some areas where the water can

1739
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,198
go

1740
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:56,000
so

1741
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,319
just to react to that this is the the

1742
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,759
difficulty about i think all this whole

1743
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,279
thing is that not that we

1744
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,080
that not that there is no solution

1745
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,600
because as smart intelligent people we

1746
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,880
can come up with solutions but do we

1747
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,120
expect them to actually be implemented

1748
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,920
and then the answer is no

1749
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
much less damage from the flooding

1750
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,520
because we had

1751
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,600
some areas where the water

1752
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,880
there was damage as well but but no

1753
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,158
no casualties right and

1754
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,799
much much less damage still too much

1755
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,080
damage

1756
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,839
much less than in germany

1757
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,679
right so then the question is okay given

1758
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,359
your institutional

1759
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,439
legal political context what can you

1760
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,080
expect to be the response

1761
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,759
if you look at uk

1762
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,839
where i looked at the flooding there the

1763
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,198
they call it the elevator effect which

1764
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,120
is really a weird thing where because

1765
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,640
you build protection

1766
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,759
the

1767
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,679
formula used to assess risk

1768
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,319
lowers the risk which says oh now i can

1769
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,679
build because insurance is cheaper

1770
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,760
because they're built value at risk goes

1771
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,000
up so you have to build more protection

1772
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,440
which then lowers the risk you build

1773
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,679
more and it's like what the we are

1774
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,440
doing exactly the wrong thing

1775
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,679
but from that logic this is the logical

1776
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,120
thing to do keep on building where you

1777
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,480
shouldn't be building

1778
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,800
and nice experience experiment at this

1779
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,960
very moment is moving jakarta up the

1780
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,600
mountain a little bit indonesia right so

1781
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,120
how do you move a city

1782
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,640
can you organize it

1783
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,280
because it's the main capital or

1784
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,719
they're switching actually

1785
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,320
this vision capital so some countries

1786
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,440
seem to get it

1787
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,719
right and if you know that your

1788
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,640
environment will not have that ability

1789
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,199
to adapt and build better

1790
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,600
what does that mean for you then

1791
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,440
do you then preemptively start you know

1792
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,800
your next house will not be in there

1793
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,120
there if there is a next house should

1794
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,400
there be a next house can you even

1795
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,199
i

1796
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,480
yes so we couldn't feed our own

1797
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,400
population just from our agriculture yes

1798
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,560
you cannot presumably these other

1799
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,800
countries wherever you're from if they

1800
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,880
have agricultural problems caused by

1801
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,640
climate change the first thing they want

1802
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,159
to do is stop exporting and keep the

1803
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:11,760
food are you seeing that exactly right

1804
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,320
now with grain

1805
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,040
but there's actually a website that's

1806
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,640
attracting all of the different food and

1807
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,880
sports fans

1808
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,760
generally this year there's around 30

1809
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,239
countries with some form of food export

1810
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:31,760
ban at any given time and then another

1811
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,600
like less than 10 that have some other

1812
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
weird restriction and then but the

1813
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,199
actual number of products is a bit more

1814
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,679
maybe 40 or something anyway but it

1815
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:40,640
seems

1816
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,920
like it's happening right started this

1817
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,760
year started tracking it but you can

1818
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,520
watch that and get an idea how this is

1819
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,239
going to keep growing

1820
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,400
yeah so just for the

1821
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,159
recording so there are websites which we

1822
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,159
don't have url right now that track food

1823
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,480
bands food food export bands and that's

1824
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,040
again a logical rational response to if

1825
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,560
you're a government and you need to make

1826
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,320
sure your people

1827
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,239
have to eat you will not sell your food

1828
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:06,080
anymore which is too bad for everybody

1829
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,239
else who's buying it

1830
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,840
and that's that degradation at that

1831
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,400
level to parochial protection because

1832
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,280
it's just logical they're not evil

1833
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,760
necessarily they might be also evil but

1834
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,960
you know

1835
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,920
right

1836
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,800
um

1837
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,960
yeah so what do we have we had a few of

1838
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,760
these

1839
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,760
direct disruptions short-term

1840
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,360
emergency stuff so for this

1841
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,120
i would say for these kinds of things

1842
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,239
that are shorter we know how to deal

1843
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,239
with you got your ups's you have your

1844
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,400
life straws to filter your water get the

1845
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,600
family pack size they're not very

1846
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,800
expensive

1847
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,719
i've did the math there i have them from

1848
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:41,760
home

1849
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,400
they look because again in holland i

1850
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,400
will have water

1851
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
right quality i don't know but i will

1852
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,480
have water regardless so

1853
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,800
how do i get clean water

1854
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,560
get a family size live straw i can

1855
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,960
filter 25 cubic meters i could drink the

1856
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
family of four for a year or more if i

1857
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,800
only have to drink

1858
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,080
so that's fine

1859
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,840
if you're a place where do i have water

1860
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,000
then you have a whole different problem

1861
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,199
so

1862
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,480
these kinds of things and if you take

1863
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,920
the muscle of other of needs i need to

1864
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,320
breathe every minute now every couple of

1865
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,280
seconds

1866
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,960
then i need to drink every couple of

1867
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,560
days i need to eat

1868
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,199
once a week and then it shall turn all

1869
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,480
those things so you need to have that

1870
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,159
stuff sorted out

1871
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,000
on the emergency response side just

1872
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,080
because of the first 10 days

1873
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
then there is the what you've seen here

1874
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,760
is authoritative centralized control

1875
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,679
that seems to be very

1876
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,960
common theme

1877
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
for better or worse and i find that an

1878
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,640
interesting list because a lot of the

1879
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,760
policies i'm like yeah we should

1880
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,159
probably do that

1881
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:40,960
but

1882
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,080
yeah

1883
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,120
when we start forcing people to be vegan

1884
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,400
that's gonna be fun

1885
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,960
and then we have

1886
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,840
more

1887
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,880
cultural

1888
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,960
you know how do we deal with capitalism

1889
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,760
i have no idea

1890
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,839
education

1891
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,600
supermarket supply chains food supply is

1892
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,560
always big big thing

1893
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,600
okay maybe we have a photo of this

1894
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,120
slightly organized thing and i would

1895
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,719
propose a break i'm also just very tired

1896
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,159
maybe 10 minutes and then i would like

1897
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,640
to finish up with

1898
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,880
a more focused session on okay so what

1899
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,560
are the things we can do as community as

1900
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
individuals in terms of action and then

1901
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,840
we can pick up some of these things

1902
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,159
yeah um

1903
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,260
[Music]

1904
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,120
okay so welcome back thank you for

1905
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,560
coming back it's always a fun to

1906
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
actually see the audience returned which

1907
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,679
is

1908
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,840
always aggressive brakes are critical

1909
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,480
you never know

1910
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,880
that's my test with lectures you know in

1911
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,400
the halfway because we usually teach two

1912
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,440
hours after one after the other and

1913
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,239
halfway that nobody comes back anyway so

1914
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:34,320
let's do the final exercise um

1915
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,239
and let's use

1916
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,600
different colors just to keep things

1917
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,480
separate so let's say what how what do

1918
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,600
we have blue yellow and red

1919
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,280
pink ish so let's do yellow for

1920
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,440
short term things and let's do

1921
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,920
anything that's not yellow for

1922
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,440
long term things just so that's one

1923
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,600
first separation and we'll hand please

1924
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,679
share

1925
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,760
so use bright for

1926
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,719
short

1927
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,320
dark for long

1928
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,480
yellows do we have blue there yeah

1929
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,719
i'm getting there so what i would like

1930
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,560
to do now is because we talked about the

1931
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,480
socio-technical stuff going wrong more

1932
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,000
ecological environmental stuff going

1933
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,960
wrong

1934
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,719
let's think about

1935
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,159
what can you do

1936
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:21,199
what are the things to to

1937
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,679
to learn to train

1938
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,800
to teach

1939
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,000
to organize what it is

1940
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,159
let's keep it as close home as we can

1941
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,760
because societally we kind of all know

1942
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,239
but that's all the stuff that's not

1943
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,760
it's useful but not something that's

1944
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,440
actionable that will help me in my daily

1945
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,800
life and that's what i would like to get

1946
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,320
out of here is

1947
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,960
can we get some form of grip

1948
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,320
so what are the things that are

1949
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,080
short-term actions and activities that

1950
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,360
we can do

1951
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,600
what's your definition of

1952
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,080
yes that's thank you for the question uh

1953
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,679
no i would want to keep it even shorter

1954
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:54,960
that would be the

1955
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,639
i have to deal with an emergency caused

1956
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,120
by climate change and whatever so food

1957
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,880
running out my medicines running out uh

1958
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,280
i whatever i'm being flooded my

1959
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,120
roof blew off

1960
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,960
these kinds of things and the long terms

1961
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,880
are

1962
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,800
what do what do i teach my kids what

1963
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,560
kind of skills do i want them to have to

1964
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,159
live in a world that's going to

1965
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,520
experience

1966
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,280
maybe authority well-meaning but or

1967
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,800
territorial governments that's going to

1968
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,400
mean disruptive economic systems is

1969
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,600
going to mean

1970
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,679
you know access to limited information

1971
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,120
all of those things

1972
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,800
so long-term skills long-term

1973
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,199
behaviors whatever comes to mind

1974
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,080
versus more short-term oriented things

1975
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,840
stickages

1976
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
yeah

1977
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,600
yeah please can we have more darker ones

1978
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,239
long-term ones oh here okay

1979
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,900

[Music]

1982
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,719
those papers but yeah or we have to use

1983
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,880
more plastic

1984
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,040
[Music]

there are some more darker ones here

1992
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,040

1993
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,159
and

1994
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,840

it something short and a darker color

1996
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,159
for the long term

and

1998
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,280
think about things you would like to

1999
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,880
learn because you think it's useful to

2000
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,480
know because it will help you deal with

2001
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,679
change

2002
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,920
things that you will teach your kids or

2003
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,480
i should teach my kids

2004
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,599
things you wish your neighbor knew

2005

[Music]

2006
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,320
and if it's something very specific to

2007
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,000
your situation please add in which

2008
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,440
situation does this make sense

2009
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,679
like i want to learn how to do

2010
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,199
permaculture that

2011
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,639
is great but that means i have to have a

2012
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,320
place to do permaculture so if i live in

2013
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,360
a flat

2014
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,840
that's not very

2015
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,880
useful doesn't mean it's

2016
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,480
never

2017
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,760
i mean if you think that's useful thing

2018
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,360

[Music]

2048
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:45,040
so um

2049
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,320
let's just look at that because there i

2050
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,679
see many different things let's look at

2051
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,679
the short-term things

2052
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,159
uh de-growth yourself today the person

2053
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:54,960
who wrote this just clarify a bit more

2054
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,199
yes please

2055
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,600
it's a matter of thinking how

2056
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,280
how we could use less resources

2057
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,320
what i'm not doing maybe

2058
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,480
how i'm not doing myself sufficiently

2059
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,159
because if tomorrow we are going to have

2060
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,040
a partial collapse or problems

2061
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,639
the less you need and the less you're

2062
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,239
using the more prepared you're going to

2063
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:19,199
be and also the exercise itself of

2064
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,320
thinking and

2065
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,960
going through the

2066
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,440
so the question is let's think about

2067
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,840
what do you really need

2068
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,120
all right do i need that third game

2069
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,040
computer or

2070
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,159
right

2071
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,639
that server in my

2072
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,199
of course you do

2073
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,280
all three of them yeah yeah okay weapons

2074
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,880
stashing and or 3d printing them

2075
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,840
or something like that i get it

2076
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,760
it's

2077
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,199
americans have

2078
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,040
plenty proven that it's not a real

2079
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,080
viable solution

2080
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:04,400
and to be contrary i would say

2081
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,159
it also helps and that's i don't know

2082
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:07,760
it's a strange thought right because you

2083
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,679
know people will be dicks as well at

2084
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:11,120
some point

2085
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,719
and so what's that balance because

2086
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,400
especially when things get ugly how do

2087
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,840
you balance that out

2088
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,760
you know you cannot go full u.s because

2089
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,159
that doesn't work

2090
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:23,120
sorry for the americans

2091
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,880
no no i'm specifically just responding

2092
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,400
to weapons right because the society

2093
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,760
that's so weaponized is just going to be

2094
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,199
scary

2095
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,120
on the other side

2096
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,880
i don't know it's i think it's a very

2097
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,320
tough moral question because you don't

2098
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,600
want to be defenseless you want to be

2099
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,480
you know you're going to protect your

2100
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,360
family of course you will

2101
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,679
no it's i'm glad you brought it up it's

2102
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,920
scary but switch to work close to home

2103
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,080
i'll move that to more or long term but

2104
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,400
i get it

2105
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,880
vocally public your pose cc yeah climate

2106
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,360
change denial if you have the nerve and

2107
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,070
energy yes please

2108
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,639
[Music]

2109
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,199
aikido there we go

2110
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,679
unarmed defense no that excellent point

2111
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,800
uh this one vocal vocal there is always

2112
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,239
a worry though that people who don't

2113
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,480
want to believe will never ever

2114
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,239
want to understand and

2115
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,920
you see it in europe you see it very

2116
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,440
much in the u.s

2117
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,199
it's so extremely polarized because of

2118
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,560
various reasons

2119
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,320
breaking that you know there's basically

2120
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,760
no point anymore because they will not

2121
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,960
listen to you

2122
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,320
i i see the point is not necessarily

2123
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,560
not necessarily trying to

2124
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,320
convince people who are already climate

2125
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
change denies not to do that but to try

2126
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,800
to make sure that if you're in a in a

2127
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,560
society while we're all in the society

2128
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,000
if you're in a particular group of

2129
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,760
people a particular discussion making

2130
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,520
sure that they don't stand unopposed so

2131
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,800
no one's going to hear that and think oh

2132
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,400
that sounds reasonable no one's

2133
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,840
disagreeing with the continuous

2134
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,080
anti-voice of keeping it loud yeah

2135
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,600
stopping and spreading civil

2136
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,239
disobedience very much so i agree

2137
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,320
very much depends on

2138
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,679
can you do you there do you have the

2139
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,440
ability to actually go and be chained

2140
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,480
into a fence sometimes it works

2141
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,239
um

2142
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,880
save a three kilo beaver okay

2143
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,040
do not buy ice cream from the north pole

2144
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,239
fair enough

2145
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:11,199
learn as many languages i like this one

2146
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,800
uh

2147
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,480
i don't know why i should move it to

2148
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,760
long term i think that makes sense but i

2149
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,760
like it as a

2150
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,960
communicate

2151
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,560
right it's the more you communicate the

2152
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,800
better and across cultures that's always

2153
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,119
hard 3d printing of false teeth i think

2154
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,480
that's really nice

2155
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,639
things you can

2156
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,000
i mean these are the things that you

2157
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
know imagine you are in a barter economy

2158
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,920
where you can't the pavement system is

2159
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,400
down and you know you can make teeth and

2160
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,679
people need that

2161
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,119
and you're making you know yeah i don't

2162
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:41,119
know life straws yeah that's

2163
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:44,320

2165
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,970

[Music]

2167
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,440
simple things i have strap-on bands for

2168
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,080
like these ratchet bands because i carry

2169
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,440
lots of loads

2170
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,440
last storm i just brought them out of my

2171
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,040
car because i don't know i was i was

2172
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,719
paranoid and i ended up strapping down

2173
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,960
my shed it did not fly off it's like

2174
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,239
just have

2175
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,679
you have a shed that could fly have

2176
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,679
things to tie down in case of

2177
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,000
it worked i saved my shed

2178
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,260
looked really funny with like tape

2179
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,920
[Music]

2180
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,600
organized local communities yes awesome

2181
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,199
volunteer

2182
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,040
this stuff touches people's lives and

2183
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,480
that's

2184
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,080
you help somebody they will always

2185
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,920
remember that and they might come back

2186
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,880
and you know open source is viral

2187
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,440
community building is viral

2188
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,639
and think about these things that's

2189
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,159
great even though i would not put it

2190
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:33,360
here because that's a long term thing

2191
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,520
but it's a very good strategy

2192
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,440
have a

2193
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,119
amount of water plus food in your house

2194
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,000
have supplies medicines yep that's basic

2195
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,920
and think it true basic emergency

2196
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,840
response is just smart i mean literally

2197
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,960
the government is you know dutch

2198
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,199
government has a list have these things

2199
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,960
those lists are stupid they are not

2200
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,960
there are some very dumb things on there

2201
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,600
but as nerds we can debug that and maybe

2202
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,320
make them make you know open source

2203
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,840
emergency preparedness per region or per

2204
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,320
situation because one for a flat flat

2205
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,920
dweller single person is different than

2206
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,400
a family of six

2207
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,080
in the boonies and there they need to be

2208
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,000
change career to sustainability

2209
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,080
if you can afford

2210
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,880
get an old-fashioned csm

2211
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,480
because

2212
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,040
you might need it

2213
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,119
right have old tech also which i

2214
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,560
appreciate that so have low tech

2215
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,480
available because you never know

2216
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,239
and not hoard them but have a few just

2217
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,440
in case yeah

2218
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,679
change of careers not for everybody

2219
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:38,000
available obviously but that's if you

2220
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,600
can

2221
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,280
because if it feels better you're going

2222
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,639
to be more enjoying it you'll be doing

2223
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,639
something meaningful

2224
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:45,070
um

2225
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:46,480
[Music]

2226
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,800
it's a long term yes please

2227
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,199
long term

2228
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,639
i've tried to change my career okay so

2229
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,960
i'll keep it short right so

2230
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,880
the process of changing my career there

2231
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,960
you go there is so what i've seen from

2232
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,280
psychological research on this is

2233
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,360
autonomy mastery and sense of purpose

2234
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,360
the three things you need right

2235
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,199
and it's the sense of purpose often

2236
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,040
lacking in most corporate jobs because

2237
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,320
you're just buying somebody bigger

2238
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,639
 yacht right and autonomy is

2239
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,560
lacking in but sense of purpose that's

2240
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,880
why i stay in academia for me that's how

2241
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,920
it works for me yes

2242
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,239
autonomy mastery and sense of purpose so

2243
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,159
you want to be free to to act you want

2244
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,000
to be good at what you're doing and it

2245
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,080
has to mean something

2246
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,760
and that last one is maybe the most

2247
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,320
important one because if it's meaningful

2248
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,880
then you will accept

2249
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,320
much less because you know why you're

2250
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,639
doing it it's meaningful then the salary

2251
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,800
doesn't really matter for me

2252
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,880
if it's yeah if it's high enough to

2253
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,159
sustain my

2254
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,920
that's a very positive because and what

2255
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,960
sustaining means is very different

2256
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,000
for different people and that's

2257
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,280
something that really matters you know

2258
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,800
what your local situation is right

2259
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,679
d growth very much so that's also that

2260
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,840
attitude right do you need new stuff or

2261
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,440
are you do is

2262
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:07,040
having secondhand furniture of virtue

2263
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,760
because why spend money right uh

2264
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,960
i don't know okay uh playing football in

2265
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,400
a refugee camp

2266
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,199
football i don't what's that

2267
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:19,760
that's that's me that was me

2268
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,320
somebody said like meditate what skills

2269
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,480
do you need in refugee camp

2270
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,800
so what is football

2271
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,480
ah like just football all right i

2272
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,159
thought you meant football so there was

2273
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,840
uh

2274
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,280
no no i thought you meant something

2275
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,480
different but okay

2276
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,280
another one learn to spell uh no so like

2277
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,760
uh to to play

2278
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,920
with other people in order to make

2279
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,360
connections

2280
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,600
and i think that's a you know can you

2281
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,600
survive in a refugee camp yeah because

2282
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,840
that's that's a shitty you know this is

2283
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,159
how humans are shitty to other humans

2284
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,159
and can you handle that and that's not

2285
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:59,599
fun if you see what's going on there

2286
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,760
yep

2287
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,199
solutions i will yeah that's a

2288
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:08,880
i like this one think about business

2289
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,760
models that make people make help people

2290
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,239
make money by saving the planet

2291
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,320
if you can do that you will be very very

2292
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,520
rich

2293
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,840
which is glorious right said the chinese

2294
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,800
but how do we make

2295
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,480
saving the world extremely profitable

2296
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,719
is

2297
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,560
right so

2298
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,920
inform repair for local

2299
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,440

01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,760
came downstairs said the ps4 control is

2345
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,400
broken where's the screwdriver

2346
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,840
not like i want a new one no where's the

2347
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,119
screwdriver

2348
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,119
because he grew up in hackerspace and

2349
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,119
that's of course you just opened things

2350
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:29,920
up

2351
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,760
and then i've blown kids minds by just

2352
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,360
giving the screwdriver an old toaster

2353
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,400
and they were like

2354
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,440
you can open it it's like yeah

2355
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,719
and when you're in this community you

2356
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,480
really forget

2357
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,320
how weird we are in the sense that of

2358
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,560
course you're gonna open it up and get

2359
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,760
kids in that mindset because it's

2360
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,760
fixable right

2361
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,520
teach kids to enjoy free things in life

2362
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,960
yes

2363
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,400
experiences

2364
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,239
switch to working close to home if you

2365
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:58,000
can boycott non-sustainable

2366
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,239
i want to i want to pause at this one

2367
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,239
there's a huge amount of corporate

2368
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,400
shaming of consumers

2369
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,239
it's very easy for shel to say oh we

2370
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:09,760
should don't drive green no you

2371
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,159
guys no clean up your act

2372
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,000
there's a lot of pushing into individual

2373
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,159
responsibility but there for that it

2374
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:19,199
means that there has to be choice

2375
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,119
and if i'm a single mom

2376
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,719
on welfare

2377
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,159
and have four kids

2378
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,480
i will buy the cheapest bio

2379
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,639
industry meat for my kids because

2380
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,639
they're growing i want them to eat meat

2381
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,880
because need protein i cannot afford to

2382
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,920
be sustainable because i have no money

2383
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,360
and then you get guilt on top of that

2384
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,440
so this one is very tricky because how

2385
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,520
what can you boycott and can you afford

2386
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,760
to buy god that this is for rich people

2387
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,840
and yes do it but don't shame people

2388
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,920
into it

2389
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,080
and a lot of the

2390
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,800
well-meaning vocal crowd will go crazy

2391
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,960
on that and shame people who can't

2392
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,320
afford to do that

2393
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,760
and being poor is expensive you know

2394
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:01,880
that

2395
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,520
[Music]

2396
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,679
right poverty traps and you buy an old

2397
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,440
inefficient washing machine because you

2398
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,280
have a couple of kids which then uses a

2399
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,760
lot of power use a lot of energy breaks

2400
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,199
often you have to but you will never be

2401
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,960
able to afford to buy a melee of 2000

2402
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,840
euros because

2403
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,400
right and a person who has so much on

2404
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,440
the head is dealing with these things

2405
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,719
cannot afford to think about these

2406
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,960
things so how do we help people who

2407
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,840
cannot afford to be picky

2408
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,159
that's that's hard

2409
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,519
right but then that has to be there

2410
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,760
right well for example one thing i do i

2411
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,880
volunteer every now and then with the

2412
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,320
repair cafe

2413
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,600
and if you don't have a repair cafe

2414
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,520
start one repair cafe basically has been

2415
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,119
announced that there'll be a group of

2416
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,960
people fixing stuff on saturday morning

2417
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,400
in the community center come bring your

2418
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,239
thing you can bring one device and we'll

2419
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,159
try to fix it if not

2420
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:54,159
then we'll just dispose of it

2421
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,400
and the number of tiers of joys i

2422
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,400
created just by replacing a fuse it's

2423
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,760
just shocking

2424
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:00,960
because if you i mean you're a nerd you

2425
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,560
literally just unscrew it you re-tighten

2426
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,719
the thing and people go oh my god this

2427
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:06,960
was my and i'm not exaggerating my my

2428
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,639
husband recently died this was your

2429
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,560
favorite radio and i stopped working and

2430
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,600
how it works again

2431
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,520


2432
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,880
now things are weird then what did you

2433
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,719
do yeah unscrew a screw right plant

2434
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:20,960
medicine yes

2435
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,239
but it's like

2436
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,000
i just

2437
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,040
learned how plants

2438
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,719
you know

2439
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,480
geek out on on that right i mean you

2440
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,400
know what if paracetamol runs out well

2441
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,759
you go find the willow and chew on it

2442
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,119
salicylic acid comes from velocity

2443
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,040
lots of right so why not i mean this is

2444
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,159
going to make you more stupid if you

2445
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,760
know your local biology and what's

2446
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,119
useful no

2447
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,639
that's a thing to learn

2448
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,480
but you don't do that when you are

2449
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,679
trying to save your life because of

2450
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,560
storm right so you need to prepare

2451
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,480
um how to cook healthy yeah

2452
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,760
public open supply chains oh my god yeah

2453
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,320
passion mama um can somebody elaborate

2454
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,719
that's you right

2455
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,199
okay that's interesting way thank you

2456
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,040
uh but we have local pockets of

2457
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,080
information

2458
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,840
bbs private skill sharing yeah i mean

2459
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,119
start a hacker space if you don't have

2460
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,040
one

2461
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,800
just that because if people know where

2462
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,520
to come to to learn

2463
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,600
um universal knowledge repositories yes

2464
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:38,800
pirate more scientific papers

2465
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,480
absolutely uh run copies of wikipedia

2466
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,679
all the stuff that you know to do

2467
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,040
because you're nerd anyway you have that

2468
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,280
server in your cabinet do something

2469
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,880
useful with it

2470
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,679
um teach my kids to have survival skills

2471
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,560
sure why not alternative economic models

2472
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,480
for distributing what you do have

2473
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,639
if you're in us you know if your job is

2474
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,239
supply chain management and you have

2475
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:05,839
these choices yes don't do that

2476
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,560
what else do we have

2477
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,239
permaculture learn about

2478
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:13,199
polymer culture awesome farming

2479
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:14,560
more oriented to dry crops you talked

2480
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,840
about organized local communities

2481
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,040
volunteer teach meditation for

2482
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,480
compassion

2483
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,360
part of communities

2484
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,080
yeah start involving your kids when you

2485
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,320
make

2486
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,119
decisions bias decision okay

2487
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:33,840
vote for green policies yes

2488
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,280
how to build local networks

2489
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,800
neighborhoods you mean whoever wrote

2490
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,320
this you mean technically or socially

2491
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,760
both of them okay

2492
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,600
know your neighbors i like the point you

2493
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,719
knew your neighbor's phone number i

2494
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,560
don't i should probably work on that

2495
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,920
oh but that's brilliant it's that you

2496
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,560
know know your neighbors

2497
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,360
um

2498
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,679
capture more co2 than

2499
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,000
currently mid yeah

2500
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,400
excellent idea

2501
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:03,840
okay with so with things like this

2502
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:06,719
again the matter of scale comes in

2503
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,630
right it is

2504
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:12,080
[Music]

2505
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,119
less

2506
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:17,119
right so that's part of that there is

2507
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,360
we overestimate the amount of control i

2508
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,159
think we have on our emissions

2509
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,639
i don't know where the

2510
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,239
paint

2511
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:28,000
pigment that went into this plastic

2512
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,520
bottle came from i can't control that i

2513
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,159
can buy a reusable bottle

2514
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:32,960
but

2515
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,360
i can't control that so there's a lot of

2516
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,760
vast majority of impact is

2517
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,639
also behind the

2518
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:43,760
bottle consumption used 65 of the energy

2519
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,840
to create a new one also

2520
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,000
so in this case this is obviously good

2521
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,840
right but there are

2522
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,520
still 65

2523
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,199
on top of the 100

2524
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:57,199
used to create it in the first place

2525
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:58,000
okay

2526
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:58,880
so

2527
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,440
like plastic so use less plastic fine

2528
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,520
netherlands burns all with waste right

2529
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,280
uk landfills netherlands burns

2530
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,800
everything

2531
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,280
well it's law i mean you're not allowed

2532
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,280
to

2533
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:12,800
vast majorities burn let's not go into

2534
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,840
details right the point being that since

2535
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,440
plastic has been recycled and paper is

2536
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,920
being recycled the caloric heat value of

2537
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,080
dutch waste has gone down which means

2538
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,560
that we have to burn oil

2539
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,000
when we're burning waste

2540
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,520
to keep the temperatures high enough

2541
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,280
because otherwise we get dioxins because

2542
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,280
chlorine is in everything

2543
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,520
and dioxins you look at them at 100

2544
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,960
meter distance you get cancer so you

2545
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,960
really don't want the oxygen environment

2546
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,719
and when the temperatures below 600

2547
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,880
celsius they form

2548
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,800
so we solved it

2549
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,080
but then we

2550
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,199
so

2551
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:47,599
is burning plastic a bad idea

2552
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,320
yes and no

2553
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,400
right because you need that oil so it's

2554
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,719
delayed oil right i'm not advocating

2555
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:56,719
burning more plastic but it you get

2556
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:59,119
these weird interactions in the back end

2557
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,199
there is so much demand for recycled

2558
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:02,800
paper in sweden

2559
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,520
that they cut down trees make paper

2560
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,679
then shred it now it's called recycled

2561
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:08,960
and it's recycled and then solders

2562
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,560
recycled paper

2563
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,360
i'm dead serious

2564
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,239
right

2565
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,440
so you think you're doing the right

2566
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,639
thing

2567
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:19,360
and so you have no idea you can't know

2568
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,520
which is like really but yeah what i

2569
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,000
mean is something else i i mean

2570
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,239
sell your car don't fly

2571
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,440
flying yeah you don't want that yeah

2572
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,719
don't buy a new smartphone

2573
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,960
and

2574
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,080
if your furniture has to be replaced or

2575
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,239
if it's still working uh

2576
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,639
can you buy can you buy second hand

2577
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,960
that kind of things because

2578
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,440
for example furniture there's a lot of

2579
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,440
secondhand clearance

2580
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,800
people die they have

2581
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,360
eyeballs

2582
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,159
but

2583
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,000
they don't know where to

2584
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,560
put those

2585
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,320
that's the two things that matter most

2586
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,679
and then things like turning off the

2587
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:11,920
lights if you have leds nobody cares

2588
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,080
it's it's symbolic it's it's the

2589
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,040
anyway just how we're doing with time

2590
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,800
okay so

2591
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,760
um

2592
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,480
as a recap and then i'll let you go um

2593
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,159
we have a bunch of very useful you have

2594
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:25,760
a photo right

2595
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,520
yeah we have a bunch of useful stuff i

2596
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,000
think the the

2597
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,199
differs who you are depends what you can

2598
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:34,800
do but you can do a lot and i've seen a

2599
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,840
lot of community which i really

2600
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
appreciate a lot of teaching a lot of

2601
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,760
lifestyle

2602
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,960
and

2603
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,320
the weird thing with these things is it

2604
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:43,920
doesn't matter what you do and it also

2605
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,760
matters a lot what you do

2606
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,440
and that's the big paradox of

2607
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,679
individuals in groups is that that could

2608
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:50,880
you could be that one person that

2609
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,639
triggers but that trigger can only

2610
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,239
happen when there is

2611
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,400
sufficient amount now there is

2612
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,000
sociological research that says if you

2613
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,199
can get three and a half percent of the

2614
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:01,119
population to agree on something you can

2615
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,440
change society

2616
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,639
you can change society you can

2617
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,679
fundamentally cause revolutions

fair enough

2621
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,040
whether whether that actually works we

2622
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,440
don't know about it you might need less

2623
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,520
people than you think that are agree and

2624
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,199
focus so organize

2625
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:27,159
that's i think the message here

2626
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,840
i said sell your car and

2627
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,880
i think

01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,719
also 11

of the of the population sell the car

2630

don't buy a new one if you

very context dependent where you are who

you are can you afford to sell your car

that's

i cannot say you must do that but it's

2639
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,440
probably not a bad idea

2640

but only if you can

2641
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,480
we've done a lot so if you look at in

2642
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,719
retrospect we yes sir

2643
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:26,400
no no yeah

2644
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,880
we have a nice list of nice terrible

list of things that we expect have a

look come back to this

2647
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,520
think think for your situation what's

2648
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,360
important many things might not matter

2649
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,960
some might matter a lot what does that

2650
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,080
mean

2651
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,920
see if you can for yourself find things

2652
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,280
that you're like yeah i can see this

2653
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,440
happening to me how do i

2654
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,960
can i use any of these things yes please

2677
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,679
i cannot make anybody do anything i can

2678
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:47,719
hardly make myself do things

2679
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:51,599
excellent point

2680
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,000
the the reason why i did this exercise

2681
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,440
is because i did something similar for

2682
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:58,080
myself to give me some peace of mind and

2683
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,840
i've i personally learned there's some

2684
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,719
very interesting things i haven't

2685
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,239
thought about before so for me that's

2686
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,800
when because my list now grows of things

2687
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,159
to consider and some things to think

2688
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:07,199
about

2689
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:09,040
um i hope that it does works for you the

2690
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,560
same way to helps you give a slightly

2691
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,840
different angle to the same thing

2692
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,520
um what do you want to follow up it's up

2693
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,159
to you it's uh i can

2694
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:20,080
help you bring it together and then

2695
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,040
share these things and if you want to

2696
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,880
pick pick it up and run with it by all

2697
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,679
means please do so

2698
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,400
you mentioned last night at the end like

2699
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,119
um

2700
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,199
i drive an old diesel car and i'm not

2701
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:32,480
gonna replace it

2702
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,560
i i'm not able to yeah i can't

2703
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,480
i'm personally working on this

2704
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,239
project with the government or something

2705
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,199
yeah or something like that yeah yeah

2706
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,280
something that you personally can do and

2707
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:46,800
when i hear you say that i think how

2708
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,239
could i do that

2709
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,000
no but you can do other things but you

2710
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,280
can do other things

2711
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,560
any of these things

2712
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,679
because we have different skill sets

2713
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:56,000
different experiences and the skill that

2714
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,679
i think that the challenge is really

2715
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,119
look at this and say well what are the

2716
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:00,400
things where i feel i can make a

2717
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,480
difference and that could be at any

2718
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,840
level that because there's no point of

2719
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,119
comparing yourself in that sense to

2720
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:08,560
other people because you're not me and

2721
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,400
i'm not you right so it's a tricky thing

2722
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,040
right so of course i also have i'm in a

2723
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,639
particularly privileged

2724
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:16,639
position i'm

2725
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,440
very well educated i have a fair amount

2726
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,800
of money

2727
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,639
so i can do things but

2728
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,119
um what about other people how can we

2729
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:27,360
generalize this because you mentioned

2730
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,880
also this idea of shaming people to do

2731
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,800
something like don't use straws if you

2732
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,800
use a straw yeah such

2733
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,800
environment right kids also brought this

2734
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,560
home when i'm classy funny

2735
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,400
okay i don't know about that it's one of

2736
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,920
one of those diversion strategies to

2737
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,840
distract people yeah yeah

2738
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,440
of course don't use plastic as you can

2739
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,119
avoid it but it's such a little

2740
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:48,719
scapegoat that people pick up on or

2741
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,000
industry picked up on like look we're

2742
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,840
doing

2743
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,480
something but how can you see this apart

2744
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,239
from the things that kind of don't

2745
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,080
matter the things that do matter and

2746
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,119
things that

2747
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,440
are actually attainable for normal

2748
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,759
people

2749
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,080
by doing these kinds of attempts at

2750
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,400
least if you have on it yeah so one

2751
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,239
thing that um so there's there's an

2752
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:11,920
awful lot of students who go to study

2753
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,360
engineering yep

2754
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,520
a typical engineering student

2755
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,760
but quite a large portion of them don't

2756
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,239
know what they actually want to do

2757
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:21,920
one thing that probably would make some

2758
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,760
sort of sense is for engineering schools

2759
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,280
if you can get engineering schools to

2760
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,760
start and

2761
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,599
essentially teach

2762
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:32,880
a more

2763
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,639
have a track which is which teaches a

2764
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:38,400
breadth of things

2765
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,840
ranging from low tech to other things

2766
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,520
and whatever the same could be said with

2767
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,360
biology and whatever so essentially what

2768
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,040
you do is you wedge in about your wedge

2769
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,400
in an educational

2770
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,119
program essentially that that is

2771
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:50,880
basically designed to

2772
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,199
so that you know you know that more of

2773
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:54,639
the people coming out with these degrees

2774
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,560
are not completely dependent on being

2775
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,599
shoved into a complex supply chain but

2776
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,800
that works for me and that they've done

2777
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,320
that i've helped set up an industrial

2778
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,080
ecology master's program that's about

2779
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,480
sustainability so but that's my you know

2780
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,080
that's my skill influence and if you're

2781
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,199
in tech

2782
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:11,199
maybe i don't know let's imagine you are

2783
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:14,239
responsible for ordering a server farm

2784
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:16,719
but maybe you can make sure that it

2785
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:21,239
is certified in the renewable coding
