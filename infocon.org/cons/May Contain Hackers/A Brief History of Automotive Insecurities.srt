00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,080
i'm going to talk about

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,480
vulnerabilities in automotive systems

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
that's a broad range and there's plenty

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
of stuff to talk about for hours and

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,640
hours um

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
brief introduction of myself i work for

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640
bosch bosch engineering in particular

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
bosch is one of the largest car

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,960
supplier manufacturers so

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,120
if you take a random car chances are

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,920
high that some component is manufactured

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
by a bosch and porsche engineering is

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
specifically specialized in adapting

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,399
those parts uh for small serious

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,399
customers which is very exciting because

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,280
i have exciting customers and also all

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
the product range of bosch is at our

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
disposal more or less

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
at night um i love online privacy so we

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,640
are

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
hosting tour relays in vienna um i

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,720
didn't mention it we're based in vienna

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
austria and in between i do digital

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
forensics

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,960
yeah and the meme artist is on the slide

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
so these pictures that you're about to

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,320
see are memes and they are not

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
subtle copyright infringements but

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,119
pieces of art and there's my twitter

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
handle

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,920
so the goal of this talk for me is to

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
give a broad introduction into

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
automotive security um more or less a

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
path that i've been walking the past

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,640
five years

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
my background is in i.t and security i

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
didn't know much about automotive

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
security um of course

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
you i saw the headlines and since i'm

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
working now in this field for a few

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
years i thought it might be interesting

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,399
to have this one introductory talk to

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,600
everybody

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,479
who is interested in this topic

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,719
the goal is to identify the most

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,479
relevant hacks attacks and

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
vulnerabilities that have been out there

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
of course your mileage may vary so

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
there are numerous sources out there

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
just

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
go wander on the internet to figure out

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
what automotive hacking is all about

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
and also to

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
give you your own journey to automotive

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
security

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
yeah objectives

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
real world attacks that have been

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
demonstrated not theoretical attacks

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
what to expect i'll only talk about

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
public stuff so everything that is found

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,599
online

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,160
is linked i also put the slides online

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
you can find them on my twitter

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,120
and

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
every picture is usually linked to the

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
source document so you can walk from the

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
slides and read on the details of all

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,440
the different

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
attacks

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
and uh yeah basically what i observed

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,680
there are two groups that do automotive

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,879
hacking

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,879
one is the hackers for the fame and the

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,680
other

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
group is companies for the fame and some

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
fortune so the ecosystem of companies

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,959
that focus on automotive security is

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,640
growing and growing

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
and most of the time it starts by some

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
hacker fiddling with a car and trying to

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
get things to work that weren't supposed

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,519
to work or

84
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
have it uh the other way around

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
what i didn't include in this talk is

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
the automotive basics so there are

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
numerous talks and resources online

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
check out the car hacking village check

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,519
out

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,319
the open garage book about what a kanban

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
bus is how

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,040
architectures of components work in cars

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
i also didn't include apis because this

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
is just regular i.t security securing an

95
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
api for a car shouldn't be different

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
than securing an api for facebook

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
twitter whatever it is

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
i also didn't include immobilizer things

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,599
also

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
locking systems because

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
there has been tremendous research going

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
on on the megamos crypto system or high

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
tech 2 how to basically you're able to

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
steal a car because the security is not

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
done properly in the immobilizer this is

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,478
not covered here so i'm focusing on

107
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,600
every other component then the locking

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
system and the

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
immobilizers because

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
regulation demands that every car has a

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
mobilizer and usually this is done with

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
some cryptographic handshake with the

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
key or with a phone or

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
whatever it is

115
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
so let's start the journey

116
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,479
the first time

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,240
or the first nice resource i found about

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
automotive hacking was a paper from 2010

119
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
it was published at

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
an academic security conference in 2010

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
and basically what the researchers did

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
is was to analyze how the car works in

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
the

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
inner workings to figure out what a can

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
bus is how you can

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,840
replay relay or inject specific cam

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
frames to get basic functionality

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
just by hooking onto the communication

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
bus so the can bus is a very

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
simple communication bus it provides

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
real-time communication with arbitration

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
which is a great thing

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,440
if you would like to have priorities and

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
messages so unlocking the car probably

135
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,919
has a lower

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,919
priority compared to detonate the air

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
pack so

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
this is very useful for

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
most situations and what they identified

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,039
was that these frames they are not

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
protected they are not encrypted or

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
authenticated so getting your

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
debugger or your component connected to

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
one of these buses allowed to do all

145
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
kind of things that are supposed to be

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,720
regular functions by the car

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
it's rather easy to do that so you can

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
just hook up an obd port or any can

149
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
shield for a raspberry pi and you can

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
work from there to basically just sniff

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
messages and then inject them again and

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,039
see see what happens

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,639
what they were able to demonstrate is

154
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
that you could kill the engine you could

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
apply the brakes and you could disable

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,120
the brakes just by sitting on the bus

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
which is kind of the the

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,000
goal of all the hackers and attackers to

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
basically

160
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
have some functionality engaged like

161
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,039
applying the brakes or steering which

162
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,680
can do physical harm because this is

163
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,039
not supposed to happen and this

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
shouldn't happen at all costs

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
you can also see

166
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,160
down here

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
this paper was cited 2 000 times since

168
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,319
uh

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
2010

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,800
so

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
going from there through the work of

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
academics is very interesting because

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,680
you can see the popular works that have

174
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,479
been cited many times often

175
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,759
again and again

176
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,520
and in the picture to the right you can

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
see that they

178
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,319
poned the

179
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
instrument clustered display

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
so in the vehicle the tax that is shown

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
there is sent over some boss

182
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
and they were able to manipulate it and

183
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
include their own

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
message by

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,639
fiddling with the communication content

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,160
so as i said what they've identified was

187
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,039
mostly intended functionality so the

188
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
threat model at that time was that if

189
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,880
the car is locked

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
it is considered in a secure state of

191
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
course you can attach yourself to those

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
vehicle buses

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,759
but

194
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
at the same time you can also cut the

195
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
brake lines or

196
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
tamper with other sensors if you are

197
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
physically so

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
basically that was the first work to

199
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
show

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
that the regular functionality could

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
also be ab used for malicious

202
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,199
functionality

203
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
but mostly because that was beyond the

204
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
threat model back at the time

205
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
in the follow-up paper and that was

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,759
really cool

207
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
they showed how to hack a telemedics

208
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
unit in one of

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
one of their cars

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
they published it at usonic security and

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
what was really cool

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
in that talk was that they were able to

213
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,039
make that car

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
join an irc channel for command and

215
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,199
control messages so basically 2011

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
botnets were a thing as they are now but

217
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
they used irc

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
so they connected some component from

219
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
the car over the telematics unit with

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
the internet irc server and then were

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
able to submit commands to the car

222
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
they demonstrated that you could do

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,640
location tracking so issuing irc

224
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
commands hey what's your location they

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,200
were able to exfiltrate audio

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
so the car had a microphone they could

227
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
activate it remotely and get that

228
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,440
audio exfiltrated

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
what they also demonstrated was that

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
the update functionality of the

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
infotainment system

232
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,959
was unsigned so every time someone in

233
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
the dealer or in the workshop they

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
updated the software of the infotainment

235
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,519
system with the city player and thing

236
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
they did this with an unsigned binary so

237
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
basically just tampering with the binary

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,880
you could

239
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
root your uh cd player without actually

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
uh having to bypass any security measure

241
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
uh they also found and this is really

242
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,519
cool a buffer overflow in the wma parser

243
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,720
and they were able to exploit this over

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
the telematics unit via a phone call so

245
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
basically what they did is they called

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
the telematics unit because it had a sim

247
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
card it had a phone number

248
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,880
it wasn't

249
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,399
shown to the user that someone is

250
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640
calling the telematics unit because no

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
one would ever do that

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
and then they were able to exploit the

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
buffer overflow in the wma parser to get

254
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
root privileges on the telematics unit

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
which is really cool really uh the holy

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
grail of automotive hacking because uh

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
with that

258
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
amount of control remotely you can do

259
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
all kind of nasty things and you can see

260
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
it in the picture it's one of the first

261
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
iphones or

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
whatever it is they're holding a speaker

263
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
to the

264
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,959
microphone and

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
exploiting the car just like this

266
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
i've never seen anything like this again

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,800
it's really really cool

268
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,279
all right moving forward 2013 uh two

269
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,160
students uh dutch students i think yeah

270
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
university of amsterdam uh what they

271
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
analyzed was a bmw and they analyzed the

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
telematics unit as well

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
how they did it was they wrapped the

274
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
antenna of the telematics unit in

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,079
tinfoil and put an emzy catcher or usrp

276
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
or some kind of

277
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
base station fakery next to it uh and

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,680
then they were able to inspect and

279
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
modify uh sms content that was sent back

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
and forth uh they saw that

281
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
by just by intercepting the messages it

282
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
works like that if there is a command

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
waiting for the car in the back end the

284
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
car receives an sms the sms

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
triggers wake up of

286
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
the relevant components once they are

287
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,880
online the car connects to the back end

288
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
asks if there are commands and then

289
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,279
downloads these commands and executes

290
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,640
them

291
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,000
however what they saw was that

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
it used an http proxy it used their own

293
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
apn their own private online network

294
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
more or less um

295
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,760
but

296
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
there was no

297
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,240
authentication per se so it was a base

298
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
64 encoded authentication which is

299
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,240
basically no authentication and they

300
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
were able to

301
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
basically

302
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
simulate the back end and issue commands

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
to the vehicle just

304
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
like a regular back-end would do for

305
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
functionality which is part of

306
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
the car

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
what's also interesting

308
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
maybe that was replaced by the proxy

309
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,079
but in one request they mentioned that

310
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,959
the user agent of the car was firefox

311
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
3.5 on windows 7 which doesn't add up

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
maybe they saw their own user agent

313
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,240
string but it's really

314
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
interesting to see that if car

315
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
identifies as a firefox whether it's

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
legit or not i don't know

317
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
but i find it very funny

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,760
two years later uh the german adeyazi

319
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
they took up the work of them or they

320
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
replicated the work with the imc catcher

321
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,519
and because it's a german rdrc germans

322
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
love their cars so it's a quite powerful

323
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,120
institution

324
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,639
they redid

325
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
this kind of attack so again they had a

326
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
fake base station catching the car

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
and

328
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
back in 2013

329
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
there was a fleet key there was a key

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
added to sms's for commands that added

331
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
encryption and

332
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
authentication of some kind however

333
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,079
there was one key for all the cars of

334
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
the same kind so it was kind of a fleet

335
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,200
key which is

336
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
not a good thing if you do it um they

337
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
then published that

338
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
for unlocking the car uh the

339
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
car sends an uh the back end sends an

340
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
http get

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,519
request unencrypted unauthenticated so

342
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
you have the wake up sms which is

343
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,079
authenticated of some kind using

344
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,440
encryption

345
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,399
which shares the key and

346
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
yeah basically

347
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,480
what they showed was that if you see a

348
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,279
car

349
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,199
you have to read the vin which is

350
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,120
conveniently stored next to the

351
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
windshield

352
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,760
you can

353
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,800
catch the telematics unit you can wake

354
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
have it wake up connect to your fake

355
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,720
base station and unlock 2.2 million cars

356
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
yeah that was kind of not good

357
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
they also showed xml configs

358
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,040
have been unauthenticated so the car

359
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,560
could be updated for new features or

360
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,519
seated heats for rent whatever it is

361
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,399
and that was an unauthenticated xml file

362
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
and by manipulating that on the fly you

363
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
could unlock

364
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,800
additional features

365
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
in the same year there was also gm with

366
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
their onstar system so if you remember

367
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,920
in 2011 there was this remote telematics

368
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
head unit that

369
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,519
had been hacked over

370
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
calling it

371
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,120
until 2015

372
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,560
gm didn't have a fix and they didn't or

373
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
maybe they had one and they applied it

374
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,199
in

375
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,120
the workshops but for cars that never

376
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
made it into the workshop

377
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
they had to hack their

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
car themselves more or less to update

379
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,279
the software so the onstar system the

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
telematics system they was never built

381
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
at the time for

382
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
software updates

383
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
they exploited it to introduce update

384
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
functionality and updated uh 2 million

385
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,720
about 2 million cars to basically

386
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
get the fixed software by basically

387
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,440
hacking it which is kind of neat if you

388
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
hack your own product to have additional

389
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
functionality that wasn't designed in

390
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,439
the first place

391
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
2015 was also the yar the year of uh

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
charlie miller and chris valdezeg the

393
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
famous g pack which has been

394
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,560
through the media again and again so for

395
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,880
every training i give it within our

396
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
company this is a must-see of course

397
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
because

398
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,000
that changed the the entire industry to

399
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,240
some kind that it's not a good idea to

400
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
just add more sim cards but you probably

401
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
would like to have firewalls and

402
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
regular i.t security features

403
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,839
could be useful

404
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
they demonstrated it with the famous

405
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,680
video where

406
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
andy greenberg was driving on the

407
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,160
highway

408
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
they connected remotely to the car and

409
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,199
activated the radio the windshield

410
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,560
wipers and

411
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
then shut off the engine

412
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
very powerful

413
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
video and very powerful marketing of

414
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
course for enhancing security in

415
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,759
vehicles

416
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
how did they do it in their 2015 paper

417
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
they identified there was a uconnect

418
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
unit it was running qnx kind of a

419
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
real-time

420
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
embedded

421
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
system

422
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
this connectivity unit had a 3g

423
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,079
connection

424
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,399
to the back end and

425
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,959
it had open ports

426
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,000
locally over wi-fi so if you connected

427
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
with your car over wi-fi you could see

428
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,199
the open ports of the telematics unit

429
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
um they also saw that

430
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
you could do software updates over usb

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
for jailbreaking it so again software

432
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,439
updates were not signed you had to plug

433
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,480
in the proper file name and the proper

434
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
software some basic functionality like

435
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
some checksums to identify that

436
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,559
it's a legit legit software update and

437
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,319
just by manipulating the software they

438
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
could change the software but of course

439
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
um it's not straightforward you cannot

440
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
just disassemble it right away and take

441
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,080
some pain to modify the software but

442
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
what they then found and this is the the

443
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
big thing is

444
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
they found that each car has two ip

445
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
addresses one of them is for the in

446
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
vehicular services so if the car spawns

447
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
a hotspot

448
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
it connects to a proxy and that is the

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
external ip then

450
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
but they also saw that the telematics

451
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
unit had a

452
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
self

453
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
announced ip address more or less so

454
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,840
everything in the car was using the

455
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
proper connection

456
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,240
but

457
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
there was also the regular ip address

458
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
that wasn't firewalled

459
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,520
they had to scan

460
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,480
two

461
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
net ranges

462
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
of

463
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
sufficient size

464
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,039
and could connect to it because

465
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,520
the telematics unit did not expose the

466
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
open ports only locally but also on the

467
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
internet interface which is

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
not a good thing and the the video

469
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,520
clearly demonstrates that

470
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,080
2000

471
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
2015 was also a great presentation uh at

472
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
defcon

473
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,240
where uh two guys hacked their tesla

474
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
they identified that of course it's a

475
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
local linux of course it connects to

476
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,840
some kind of

477
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
back end called mothership

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,360
using a vpn

479
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
but by local manipulation they were able

480
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,799
to ssh into that car

481
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
and they could do all kind of

482
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
nasty things using this ssh connection

483
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,160
so they could turn off the car or open

484
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
the doors basically everything that is

485
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,799
regular functionality or functionality

486
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,320
over the app

487
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
they were able to demonstrate that as

488
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,600
well

489
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,039
again you had to have local access but

490
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,679
if you put your car in the dealership

491
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,320
you could basically back door every car

492
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,799
again and again that is coming in

493
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
and then at a later point in time go

494
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
harvest all the belongings in the car or

495
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
take the cars themselves

496
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,080
one

497
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,880
once physical access is enough to

498
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,039
pertain physical access

499
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,200
for the future

500
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
and again

501
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,600
they showed all the different

502
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
architectures um every car is different

503
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
in the architecture and the used

504
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,360
components so uh one of the first thing

505
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
most people do is to figure out okay

506
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
which components are in there what

507
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
communication buses they use and how

508
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,440
could this potentially be exploited

509
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
another work from 2015 also very

510
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,039
interesting

511
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,360
they demonstrated in an academic

512
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
publication

513
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,440
that after-market obd dongles things

514
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
that you plug into your obd port to have

515
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
diagnostics or

516
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,880
i don't know status messages the things

517
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
that you do with your car insurances

518
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
sometimes do that

519
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
they identified a popular brand and

520
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
dissected it

521
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
and found that they have the same ssh

522
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,280
key pair on all the obd toggles and they

523
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,919
were sold in the thousands

524
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
not a good thing to have the same ssh

525
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
key because once you compromise one of

526
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,880
these

527
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,360
dongles you could compromise every other

528
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
and

529
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,720
yeah basically they also demonstrated it

530
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,679
on showdown 2000 devices

531
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,559
by remotely applying the brakes so they

532
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,960
wrote an app they connected to the

533
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,039
vehicle to the obd

534
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
port in question this could be done over

535
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
the internet and then they were able to

536
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,880
inject break messages to basically bring

537
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
the car to a halt which is again

538
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
the endangering physical safety which is

539
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,880
not a good thing

540
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,600
2016 miller and valasek striked again

541
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
they showed

542
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,679
more advanced analysis of their gpac

543
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,760
and what they were able to demonstrate

544
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
which didn't quite work

545
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,039
in 2015 was some sophisticated

546
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,799
techniques to

547
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,440
basically denial of service specific

548
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
component so basically what they

549
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,559
observed was that

550
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
if you put an ecu some component into

551
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
boot mode into boot rom mode they wait

552
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
for a software update and they will

553
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,559
never wake up again until the software

554
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,520
or the car is restarted or the software

555
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
is applied um also cars cannot handle

556
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
conflicting messages so if the message

557
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
doesn't have a counter or a

558
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
cryptographic authentication tag with

559
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,080
them

560
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
you could simply

561
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,640
inject a contradicting message and the

562
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,960
car wouldn't know which message

563
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
is the valid one

564
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
some messages had counters and they

565
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
could because they only increment

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
counters nothing magically

567
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,520
they could predate the counters and send

568
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
the message before the next legit

569
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
message and thus

570
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,799
prevent the legit message from arriving

571
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,360
and uh yeah what they also demonstrated

572
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
in somewhere where there were plenty of

573
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
cornfields was that they were able to uh

574
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
engage the brakes and

575
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
steer using the parking assistant so

576
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,679
this is kind of the most physically

577
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,520
attack that could

578
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
be possible if you're driving on the

579
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,880
autobahn

580
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,520
and all of a sudden your steering wheel

581
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
turns to some angle is definitely going

582
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
to be resulting in a

583
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,720
crash 2016 was also the year of keen

584
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,880
labs they demonstrated in a blog post

585
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
first how they were able to get

586
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,960
root access on a tesla

587
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
they did this by

588
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
exploiting the fact that tesla's always

589
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
connects to a known wi-fi which is you

590
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
can find it online

591
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
so if you drive up to a supercharger

592
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,280
your car will connect uh to this wi-fi

593
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
and will ask for software updates and

594
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
things like that

595
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
they were able to

596
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,360
trigger a webkit exploit so the

597
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
the the screen in the middle had a

598
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
browser that browser was not fully

599
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
patched and

600
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,400
by redirecting and intercepting

601
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
the browser communication

602
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
they were able to

603
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,080
exploit the browser and because the

604
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
kernel had been outdated they were able

605
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,200
to

606
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
elevate their privileges to root access

607
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
to basically do anything over the

608
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
networks because they

609
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,559
got root

610
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,360
they also presented this at black cad in

611
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
2017

612
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,919
and

613
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
basically i'm not sure if you can see it

614
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,320
on on the right but that's the infamous

615
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
christmas show video where they had two

616
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,120
cars

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
dancing more or less and blinking with

618
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
uh

619
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
specific patterns to um

620
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
and they did this by

621
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
this exploit chain

622
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,799
they also said that okay there's uh

623
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,240
the the

624
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
software update for the gateways module

625
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,600
isn't on is not signed

626
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,080
after the publication everything has

627
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,440
been signed

628
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
and also tesla pushed the kernel from

629
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,600
2.6 ish to 4.4 ish

630
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
so basically based on these public hacks

631
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
the software security tremendously

632
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
increased compared to

633
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
the previous tesla hack

634
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
in 2018

635
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
keen labs did it again

636
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,360
they presented their findings on the

637
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,520
tesla x and because the kernel has been

638
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
locked down and updated no known

639
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,000
vulnerabilities and they had to find

640
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,840
another way into the kernel and this

641
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,880
time they did it with the kernel module

642
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,760
for the nvidia tegra chip

643
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,480
which is part of if you want to use your

644
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
uh

645
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
not sure which component it is but if it

646
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,440
has an nvidia tegra chip that is run in

647
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
the kernel and there was a bug in tear

648
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,360
in there to elevate privileges

649
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
they also identified that and that's

650
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,559
cool

651
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,760
if you prepend the signature with some

652
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,480
spaces there's a confusion and

653
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
the car

654
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,960
rendered the software update as legit

655
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
even though you just had to add one or

656
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
two spaces before the signature

657
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
to

658
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,520
bypass that signature check and they

659
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,960
also

660
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
talked about details on the tesla

661
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,840
xmis

662
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,880
show in 2018 there was also the

663
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,120
leonard wooter's tesla hack

664
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
i know i promised in the beginning it's

665
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
not about locking but this is kind of

666
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,440
locking because it's really cool

667
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,880
what leonard wutes was able to

668
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,440
demonstrate is that you have to get two

669
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
challenges from the car so every time

670
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
you pull the handle the car sends out

671
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
over

672
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
not sure which frequency

673
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,720
challenge and if the key fob or

674
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,919
any other device used for authentication

675
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,320
is able to answer that challenge the car

676
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,520
unlocks

677
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,799
and

678
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
he was able to

679
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,080
bypass that by just using two challenges

680
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
from the car and collecting one response

681
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,559
from the key fob built a rainbow table

682
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,440
of five terabytes and basically was able

683
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
to unlock every tesla because they all

684
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,879
had the same

685
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,400
locking system

686
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
the locking system itself was from an

687
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
external supplier so even though this is

688
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
the famous tesla hack uh it also

689
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,640
infected numerous other cars that had

690
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,919
the same locking system implemented um

691
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,200
it used some proprietary crypto dst40

692
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
and you can see on the right the

693
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
wake up signal

694
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,880
arrives at the key fob the key fob

695
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,760
replies then the car sends a 40 bit

696
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
challenge and the key fob responds with

697
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,840
a 24 bit response 24-bit isn't that much

698
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,520
for

699
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,360
2018 and that's why he was able to

700
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,399
enumerate all the challenges and all

701
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,279
the responses

702
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,360
in 2019 tesla participated in the pawn

703
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
to own contest

704
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
so basically

705
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
if you can compromise a thing you can

706
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,399
keep it

707
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,840
you have to just publicly disclose the

708
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
way and the vulnerability that you have

709
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,880
used

710
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,120
they

711
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
the fleura acetate team they

712
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,399
demonstrated a jit bug in the browser

713
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,039
and successfully exploited the

714
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,039
infotainment and

715
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,320
they won 35 000k again browser

716
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,120
vulnerability uh most of the time if it

717
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
has a browser or if it has a linux

718
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,039
kernel if it's not running on the latest

719
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,679
version uh chances are high that there's

720
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,960
something hidden in there

721
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,080
in 2019 keen labs also published or

722
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
discussed that black hat their

723
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,799
research on bmw

724
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
they more or less

725
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
identified 14 cves some of them were

726
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
remotely triggerable and

727
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
demonstrated how they did it and

728
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
what they did

729
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
they compromised the head unit you can

730
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,559
see the picture in the middle they had

731
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,960
their own logo displayed and they also

732
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
demonstrated to compromise the gateway

733
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,840
and also the telematics unit

734
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,159
this is from the

735
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
slides themselves

736
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,480
so basically this is for many modern

737
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,840
cars applicable you have an obd2 port

738
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
which goes to a switch or

739
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
straight to a gateway

740
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
and then you have somewhere you have the

741
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
telematics you have the head unit and

742
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,360
then you have the bus based systems like

743
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
controlling the engine controlling the

744
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,880
doors windows headlights whatever it is

745
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,200
also controlling things like advanced

746
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,360
sensory like you have front radar you

747
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,080
have lidar you have video all different

748
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,120
kind of

749
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
sensors are now

750
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,640
in a car

751
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
used

752
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
in 2020 a different group from china's

753
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,799
sky go 360 group published their

754
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
research on a daimler e-class i think it

755
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,960
was

756
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
they demonstrated at great length

757
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,760
the different attack vectors

758
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,880
that they tried and what i like

759
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
particularly about this is that they

760
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
also described what they tried and what

761
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
failed so it reads like an introductory

762
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,000
to automotive security and next we tried

763
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
this didn't work

764
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,000
next next and all the different steps

765
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,640
that they uh take to compromise the

766
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,480
system is outlined in a wonderful report

767
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
they didn't succeed at windows ce7 so

768
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,360
apparently if you buy a daimler for i

769
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
don't know how many thousand euros the

770
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
head unit comes with windows c7 which is

771
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,840
kind

772
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,320
of weird at least to me

773
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
they they failed at that component but

774
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,600
they

775
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,159
tried and succeeded at the telemedics

776
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
unit which is running linux on some arm

777
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,760
they were able to impersonate the car

778
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
and connect to the back end

779
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,360
what's also really great about this

780
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,279
presentation is that they used all the

781
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,480
big tools that money can buy

782
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
so they

783
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,200
soldered off the nand flash from one of

784
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,720
the components um and basically rewired

785
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
it to get access to the content stored

786
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,919
in the

787
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,399
they used an x-ray for finding the jtag

788
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,240
ports because they were hidden somewhere

789
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,720
in between the layers and they also

790
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,399
re-implanted

791
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,919
this nand chip

792
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
for implant

793
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,399
implanting a back door so basically they

794
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,559
took the component out of the car they

795
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,000
took the chip off the pcb they rewrote

796
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
it with different software and then

797
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,039
reballed it to the component and put

798
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,200
everything back together it must have

799
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,519
been a tremendous amount of work that

800
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,880
went into that

801
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,519
and it's really hard to defend against

802
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,000
such powerful and capable

803
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,760
attackers of course you could encrypt

804
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,200
the content but then you can still yeah

805
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,880
it's more or less

806
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
very interesting because of the tools

807
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
they used

808
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,720
early 2021 there was a tweet by some ea

809
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,919
foundation

810
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,679
and that was particularly interesting

811
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,720
because

812
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
that was not a talk that was not

813
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,720
presentation at some security conference

814
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,039
it wasn't a vendor it was just a hacker

815
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
trying to get additional features for

816
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
their infotainment system and

817
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
basically with that tweet

818
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,440
he or she described at great length what

819
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,799
steps they took to

820
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,480
get code execution rights on the

821
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
kind of

822
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,799
not so modern infotainment system

823
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,960
you can see in the picture it runs a 2.6

824
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
kernel uh it's a nissan and it's

825
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,720
surprisingly it's a bosch component so

826
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
it's a rather old bosch infotainment

827
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,960
system that is not sold anymore

828
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,440
but of course it's still driving around

829
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
in the thousands

830
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
in this post

831
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
he or she described

832
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,399
first how to dismantle the infotainment

833
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,600
system find the serial ports and attach

834
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
to them and

835
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
using

836
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,039
the u-boot bootloader

837
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,039
he or she were able to get read write

838
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,919
access to the file system and modify

839
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,559
or at least read the entire file system

840
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,720
that is on there

841
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,200
the surprising twist in this publication

842
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,559
then was that by reading the source code

843
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,919
and reading all

844
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,320
the the binaries and things like that

845
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,799
you found that script which is uh shown

846
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,159
here below

847
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,200
that script assigns a unique name for a

848
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
usb drive that you plug in so you have

849
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
an mp3 collection you don't trust

850
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
spotify so

851
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,440
you use plain old

852
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
usb thumb drives

853
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,399
you plug it in and this usb drive is

854
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,960
then assigned a mount point and

855
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,799
if it has a uid this usb thumb drive it

856
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,840
will get that uuid

857
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
assigned as a mount point but if it has

858
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,600
a label like a name or things like that

859
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
the mount point will be created using

860
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
that label and really interesting part

861
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
is by having a label that has semicolon

862
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,440
dash dash

863
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
sum functionality or some commands you

864
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,799
can get command execution simply by

865
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,079
renaming your usb thumb drive to a

866
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,399
specific name and

867
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,560
it's genius because it's so simple you

868
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
once you have this vulnerability you

869
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,960
need to just plug in a specific usb

870
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
thumb drive wait five minutes or five

871
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
seconds

872
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,839
and you have root and can activate wi-fi

873
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,839
ssh whatever it is

874
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,918
brilliant tag

875
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,719
and of course it's also very easy to to

876
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,239
defend against because basically you

877
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,599
just need to

878
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
change that line to not include

879
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,639
semicolons or

880
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,520
every

881
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
thing that is not a character

882
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,119
to defend against that

883
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,760
another work from leonard wuters was

884
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,918
again a tesla hack but

885
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,119
this time

886
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,560
the tesla x

887
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,679
what he demonstrated was that the and

888
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
you can see it in the brilliant

889
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
presentation at uh defcon 29 car hacking

890
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
village from last year and

891
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,640
the key fob itself is a combination of

892
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
different chips

893
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
so you have a bluetooth component in

894
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,800
there you have a microcontroller in

895
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,760
there and you have a secure element and

896
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
what he demonstrated was that with this

897
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
self-built machine

898
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
he is able to wake up the bluetooth chip

899
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
of

900
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
the key fob

901
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,119
then update the software over bluetooth

902
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,359
which is a usual process

903
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,560
and

904
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,280
once the software is uploaded it is

905
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,680
checked against a signature with the

906
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,079
secure element but the vulnerability

907
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,240
here is that this

908
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
response from the secure element was

909
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,880
ignored so regardless of the secure

910
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,560
element saying yes this is a legit

911
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,119
signature or no do not apply this

912
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,040
software it's not legit

913
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
it applied the software update and

914
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,359
installed the malicious software

915
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,320
uh yeah with that he was able to extract

916
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,440
unlocked tokens for for all the doors

917
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,160
and uh everything wireless you can see

918
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,800
it in a brilliant video demonstration um

919
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,720
you just need to be within range of the

920
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
key fob to basically do all the

921
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,119
necessary steps for this attack

922
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,520
with those stolen tokens he then

923
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,359
approaches the car mimics a key fob and

924
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,320
sends the tokens to unlock the doors

925
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
once he's inside the car he attaches to

926
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
the body controller uh there's no

927
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
authentication involved which is

928
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,359
surprising um but then he could train a

929
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,680
new key fob so he bought a used key fob

930
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,839
on ebay um once he's connected to the

931
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,880
to the

932
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,760
car

933
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
he's able to say hey i have a new key

934
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,599
fob it's this and drive away with his

935
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
new car

936
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,880
another tesla hack

937
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
weinmann and schmutzler they

938
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,359
demonstrated that cancer quest how to

939
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,359
use

940
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,640
overflow buffer stack overflow over

941
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,079
wi-fi

942
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,960
to

943
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,839
get root permissions on

944
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,520
the component in question

945
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,119
they showed it in the video you can't

946
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,960
see it here but there's a drone and

947
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
basically the tag is exploitable using

948
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
this drone because all you have to do is

949
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,839
send some wi-fi packets and

950
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,800
connect

951
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
and what they were using is con man it's

952
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,040
the connection manager of yocto linux

953
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,240
and that had a stack overflow to

954
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,359
get root privileges

955
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,599
2021 king labs again so i didn't know it

956
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,520
but keen labs had a run on black hat

957
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,320
talks and demonstrations for consecutive

958
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,000
years uh

959
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,280
again and again

960
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,680
um they analyzed the

961
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,160
daimler mb mbo ux head unit system

962
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
and

963
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
they were able to

964
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
again compromise uh everything using a

965
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,960
proprietary protocol that is spoken

966
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,640
so the attack goes that upon starting

967
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
the head unit and the telematics unit

968
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,440
they exchange a

969
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
wpa encrypted key over the bus this is

970
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
unencrypted so it can be sniffed

971
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,680
they can then connect with this wi-fi

972
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,560
and then

973
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,599
do nasty things and one of the things

974
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,520
that was provided by

975
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
the head unit was

976
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,000
the proprietary high qnet protocol i've

977
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
never heard it before i don't know what

978
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,320
it is

979
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,079
but it included buffer overflows so

980
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,480
basically uh from there it's fair game

981
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,839
to um basically just compromise

982
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,160
everything

983
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,200
yeah

984
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,520
in 2021 also

985
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,040
at black hat colin of lynn demonstrated

986
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,240
that glitching ecu's is useful to bypass

987
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,359
protections

988
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,480
so usually nowadays you have a ecu

989
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,400
that is protected so you have a jtag

990
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,440
password you have a uart password and by

991
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,079
glitching these password

992
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,000
checks uh you can get access to the

993
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,320
component without needing to know uh the

994
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,160
password he demonstrated in corvette and

995
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,079
uh the the microcontroller in question

996
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,960
was a mxp microcontroller with power

997
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,160
architecture

998
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,480
which still is commonly used

999
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,960
for automotive even though everything is

1000
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,720
moving towards arm

1001
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,200
nowadays

1002
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,960
early 2020s so 2022 so we're reaching

1003
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
the end of the timeline

1004
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,440
willem melhing he's working for

1005
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,079
coma ai he dismantled the steering ecu

1006
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,280
from his

1007
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
golf

1008
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
it's from 2008 it's

1009
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,280
rather old um but

1010
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
it demonstrates nicely that

1011
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,440
it's not only about the engine

1012
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,520
controller for tuning or the body

1013
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
controller for locking

1014
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
you can also control the steering module

1015
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
simply by manipulating the software on

1016
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,880
it

1017
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,359
comma ai the company he's working for is

1018
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,040
doing a business with that

1019
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,839
so they hijack the steering and use the

1020
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,240
i think it's a stereo optical system to

1021
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,839
basically steer the car on the highway

1022
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,520
yeah very powerful write-up because

1023
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
again it shows

1024
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,119
again and again how

1025
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,160
you analyze such an automotive embedded

1026
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,880
component

1027
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
at pawn to own in may

1028
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
synecdiv demonstrated again a tesla

1029
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,680
exploit they used wi-fi there's no

1030
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
write-up yet but they will talk about it

1031
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,440
at hexacon in 2020 in october in paris

1032
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,520
how they did it i'm really looking

1033
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,760
forward to that i really hope it's

1034
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,079
getting recorded

1035
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,160
argus the company

1036
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,800
demonstrated at blackhead asia and this

1037
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760
is really some high level exploitation

1038
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
that they could exploit using a buffer

1039
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,560
overflow and embedded automotive

1040
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,040
component so usually the components they

1041
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,119
don't have linux they don't have q and x

1042
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,520
the smaller components have their own

1043
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,040
software stack

1044
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,119
specifically for automotive usually

1045
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,359
autosar or something like that

1046
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,920
and they demonstrated that they could

1047
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,640
use a buffer overflow in processing of

1048
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
those cad messages

1049
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
to get code execution on that embedded

1050
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,359
component really powerful um this is

1051
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,319
going to keep me for the next one or

1052
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,960
your two years busy not only to

1053
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,040
understand how it works but also how to

1054
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,839
derive kind of

1055
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,319
measures uh hattie to nils who showed me

1056
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,160
that that's really really powerful

1057
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,359
attack

1058
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,760
uh martin harford he's somewhere here

1059
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,800
he's going to present tomorrow on uh his

1060
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
tesla hacks he demonstrated a kansai

1061
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,839
quest

1062
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,160
bluetooth relay attack against tesla 3.

1063
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,480
so basically with a tesla 3 you have

1064
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
your key in your

1065
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
smartphone and over bluetooth they

1066
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,359
exchange the cryptographic

1067
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
dance for authentication

1068
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,599
and what he showed was that you can do

1069
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,520
this wirelessly over the internet so he

1070
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,240
built two raspberry pi's um with

1071
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,960
bluetooth interfaces and one is next to

1072
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
the key fob the other one is next to the

1073
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,359
car

1074
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,920
which basically allows anywhere

1075
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
to unlock the car there have been two

1076
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,400
other groups about the same time that

1077
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,839
showed this one is an academic

1078
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,319
publication they did it with a wired

1079
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,520
connection

1080
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,400
and

1081
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
sultan from ncc group he showed this

1082
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
two days prior

1083
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,760
so basically bluetooth relay attack

1084
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,839
works

1085
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,200
and

1086
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,800
he will present tomorrow about his

1087
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,480
wonderful vulnerability that he

1088
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,839
identified

1089
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,560
basically there was in

1090
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
if you unlock your tesla with an nfc

1091
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,480
card it's unlocked a window of 130

1092
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,240
seconds where

1093
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
you do not need to re-authenticate for

1094
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,440
example to retap the card to start the

1095
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,319
engine

1096
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,960
but what he identified was that

1097
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,920
there's

1098
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,880
no user notification of any kind you can

1099
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,359
also pair a new bluetooth

1100
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,040
key and

1101
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
thus have a new car key

1102
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,760
as a mobile phone paired with that

1103
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,880
vehicle

1104
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,000
i've seen

1105
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
somewhere on twitter kevin 2600 he

1106
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,400
tweeted that there's a software update

1107
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,000
now available

1108
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,319
i didn't verify it if you're interested

1109
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,200
in that go to his talk tomorrow

1110
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,040
it's a close proximity attack and you

1111
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,119
need to have someone tapping with the

1112
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,720
nfc card

1113
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,839
for

1114
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,960
entering the vehicle but once

1115
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,200
you see this you can pair a key and you

1116
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,280
have a new tesla really really

1117
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,760
impressive

1118
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,960
yeah that's about it

1119
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,440
this was the really rushed timeline of

1120
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,520
automotive hacks that i find

1121
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
fascinating

1122
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,359
usual disclaimer do not hack cars you

1123
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,440
might hurt yourself or others you should

1124
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,359
know what you are doing

1125
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,040
and if you would like to be informed

1126
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
twitter of course has plenty of

1127
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,280
resources there's the asrg

1128
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,599
the automotive security research group

1129
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,640
they are hosting an online uh event i

1130
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,160
think it's in september it's called

1131
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,560
secure our streets and it's will be an

1132
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,520
online conference dedicated to

1133
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,920
automotive security

1134
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
and there's the car hacking village of

1135
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,520
course defcon is around the corner and

1136
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,200
i'm really excited for

1137
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,599
the things that are going to be

1138
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,880
published there

1139
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,200
with that thank you very much and happy

1140
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,060
to answer questions

1141
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,849
[Applause]

1142
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
martin thank you very much that was an

1143
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,119
excellent concise overview of everything

1144
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,480
that happened in the last few years in

1145
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,960
car hacking and i'm i'm i'm really happy

1146
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,680
to see everything just going on

1147
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,119
and and and people working on the

1148
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,680
security of that uh having said that any

1149
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,119
questions could you come to the middle

1150
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,040
and talk close to the there's a

1151
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,160
microphone here next to the pool

1152
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,839
stand closely to the microphone and

1153
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,240
using test yes

1154
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,160
i'm not quite sure how long it's been

1155
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,040
but i remember there was a chinese group

1156
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
hacking a tesla rain sensor camera with

1157
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,880
a

1158
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
general adversarial network attack

1159
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,880
wasn't in the hacks so was it not like

1160
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,800
uh too boring or what i mean okay there

1161
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,359
was no access like

1162
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,119
good question um

1163
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,680
the what they managed is to confuse the

1164
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,920
recognizer for street and

1165
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,520
things like a stop sign

1166
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,599
i didn't include it because

1167
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,960
it's really modern and i wanted of

1168
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,040
course if you build such a system it

1169
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,720
should be obvious that you could trick

1170
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
it to some extent

1171
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,960
but it didn't include it for uh

1172
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,280
time constraints yeah okay cool because

1173
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,680
i think like the visual attack vectors

1174
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,319
stay will be a big role and as you said

1175
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,480
also nobody's securing stuff on the

1176
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,200
lower level so yeah absolutely and all

1177
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
those camera-based systems they are

1178
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,040
connected using ethernet because com bus

1179
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,839
is way too slow um hackers love ethernet

1180
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,880
so let's see where that goes

1181
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,440
yeah thank you um thank you for the talk

1182
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,680
um i saw that you are

1183
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,359
lame the kernel versions which are in

1184
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,440
this system so do they get updated on

1185
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,920
the lifetime of the car or does it have

1186
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,960
the

1187
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,040
most all the software components from

1188
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,000
when the

1189
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,560
car was designed um this is going to

1190
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,359
change so for um

1191
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,200
vehicular

1192
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,440
for getting a type approval car

1193
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,599
manufacturers now have to prove that

1194
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,240
they have some kind of update management

1195
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,480
so if you build a car and you want to

1196
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,480
have it type registered in

1197
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
unece which is more or less whole of

1198
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,000
europe

1199
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,760
south africa

1200
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,720
south america south africa australia and

1201
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,119
things like that you have to have a

1202
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,119
concept at hand how you will be able to

1203
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,359
update the software so it's not

1204
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,880
mandatory

1205
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
to update the software this is of course

1206
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,119
an economical question of course it's

1207
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,119
cheaper to do it over

1208
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,280
internet or any other mean

1209
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,240
but

1210
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,160
i'm not sure if it's obliged you just

1211
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,760
have to demonstrate that you have an

1212
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,599
update concept

1213
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,119
and this will get more and more so

1214
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,880
everybody is attaching sim cards to

1215
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,559
stuff like crazy

1216
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,400
we will get there that

1217
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,640
a car will update itself overnight

1218
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,559
thank you

1219
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,960
i've got one question myself

1220
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,720
as a user of a modern car um my eldest

1221
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,640
already told me earlier with my former

1222
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,520
car

1223
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,079
it's nice that you use that obd port but

1224
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,760
take it out when you're not near the car

1225
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,800
because someone can hack into it so yeah

1226
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
knew more than i did

1227
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,319
any other hints and tips for people

1228
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,400
what to do and what not to do

1229
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,079
with your car

1230
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,440
good question so

1231
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,599
every car is different you should know

1232
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,359
at least the wireless things that are

1233
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,839
going on uh you should understand if you

1234
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,119
pair a new

1235
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,119
car key over bluetooth

1236
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,200
that at least you should verify that

1237
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,720
there's some code you have to enter

1238
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,400
things like that

1239
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,160
you can understand the apps that you are

1240
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,559
using so if you use an android app pipe

1241
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,000
it into one of those analyzing

1242
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
frameworks and see what they do what

1243
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,559
requests they do

1244
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,920
besides that knack the manufacturer they

1245
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,440
they have the all the knowledge and

1246
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,800
documentation

1247
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,920
um

1248
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,319
and also things like the german ariat

1249
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,960
they know how to secure things

1250
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
physically

1251
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,240
thank you

1252
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,760
oh there's one more one more one more

1253
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,680
yep and but i'm going to ask for that

1254
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,359
applause but one more question just one

1255
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,680
quick question um so since they are now

1256
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,599
popping up a lot of small companies that

1257
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,359
build electric cars because you need to

1258
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,720
don't need that mechanical driveshaft

1259
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
and all that stuff anymore

1260
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,440
are you aware of any company that kind

1261
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,800
of tries to build a secure car open

1262
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,559
concept-wise maybe something like that

1263
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,160
because there's just all the other stuff

1264
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
is going to end up like smartphones with

1265
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
bloatware and all the other and i

1266
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,720
don't want that yeah it's more or less

1267
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,040
about the time of market so if a

1268
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,960
manufacturer is really keen on hitting

1269
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,680
time to market early they will take

1270
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
available components plug them together

1271
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,839
and not put much effort into changing

1272
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,440
them

1273
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,839
on the other side if you have a robust

1274
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,760
background and

1275
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,000
robust knowledge of a vehicular chances

1276
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,240
are high that you have a concept for

1277
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,000
security and key management and things

1278
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,119
like that

1279
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,960
so i expect that

1280
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,200
new companies that make an electric

1281
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,319
vehicle

1282
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,640
they will do the same mistakes again and

1283
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,440
again just like all the big ones did

1284
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,520
but eventually we will get there every

1285
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
supplier will be

1286
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,800
required to do security update ability

1287
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,000
things like that

1288
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,200
it will change

1289
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,119
yeah it's more like is there like a

1290
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,640
offline per design thing that was like

1291
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,319
i don't know any

1292
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,640
it's all about convenience and apps and

1293
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
yeah

1294
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,800
i like that sentence eventually we will

1295
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,760
get there

1296
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,280
and i think let's keep it on that for

1297
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,680
today ladies and gentlemen big hand

1298
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,680
again

1299
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,559
you
