[Music]

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
so first of all thank you all for coming

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
to this presentation uh it's one that i

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,240
noticed uh in the schedule i was very

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,199
excited about um there's a lot of math

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
and a lot of uh complexity to pattern

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,119
making and people

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,800
often forget how

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
how complex and how much technology has

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
been driven by trying to solve this and

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
how much

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
of the execution is still by hand

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
so we have a very special

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,440
talk tonight

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,719
now um

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
i wanted to remind you all

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,760
to

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
to continue to hydrate i know that we

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,960
always encourage you but just think you

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
know where is your hydration source

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
right now it's trying to keep you alive

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
are you allowing it to keep you alive

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,359
you might want to think about it

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
especially as the night continues

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
also

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
there's opportunities to be an angel

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
all across this conference is the best

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
way to really get to know how things

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
work and contribute i mean we are all

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
collectively volunteering to make this

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
happen and so uh find a way to give back

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,159
it's it's really uh rewarding uh and in

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
some cases you know actually literally

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
rewarding they'll give you a shirt and

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,439
you can get some food vouchers and that

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,479
kind of thing

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,119
also they made special patches

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
just for two of the most important might

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
not think but the most important

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
angel tasks which is waste and parking

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,079
so those patches are quite nice and the

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,520
only way to get them

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
is to sign up to be an angel and

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,360
contribute in that way

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,479
um

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,360
yeah

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,799
so

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,360
we will we will jump into the talk now

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
so

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
our

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
event tonight is free sewings sewing

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,880
patterns based on code we have alexander

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
here this is an opportunity to learn

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
about this open source platform

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
and lexander is

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,800
as described by by this uh

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
introduction

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
an enthusiastic contributor this so

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
you're going to get to know a lot of

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
things about this project

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
which has a lot more implications for

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
you and your life and how you wear

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
clothes and how you might wear clothes

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,599
so

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
enjoy

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
thank you

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
hi i'm alexander as told

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
i'm a 20 year old from the netherlands

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
and here to represent free sewing

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
um so

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
this is a plat

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
simply said it's a platform that turns

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
your measurements into a sewing pattern

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
made for your body so

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
that enables you to make clothes for

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
your body that fits you

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,159
great

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,319
well

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
free sewing aims to become the wikipedia

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
of sewing

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
with not just sewing patterns but also

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
sewing guides programming guides

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
github guides community guides

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,959
so let's just jump right in

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
yes awesome okay so let's start at the

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,599
very beginning a sewing pattern it's

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
basically a piece of fabric that you sew

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,840
together to become a garment

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,040
in the fashion industry

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
these patterns are based on the ideal

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
body

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
which is usually a skinny white woman or

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
a high fashion model of the catwalk

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,879
and

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
sewing patterns are based on this body

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
and therefore clothing that you buy in

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,760
stores as well

98
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
so

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
um we will talk more about that free

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
sewing strengths and flaws components of

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
a free sowing pattern and upcoming

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,780
plants

103
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,000
[Music]

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
let's see

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
so like i said the ideal body a

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
mannequin on which sewing patterns are

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
drafted on

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
and you buy these based on the ideal

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,680
body the ideal body that doesn't exist

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
and this this ideal body also differs

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
between designers so

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,759
um makes it even harder to find the

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,080
right size for you and

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
these garments are then categorized into

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919
two genders menswear women's wear little

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,039
room for inclusivity

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,960
so some garments are simple like a face

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,160
mask it's just four pieces of fabrics

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
you add some elastic straps and you have

120
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
a face mask with pattern like this

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,360
you can get away with making just a few

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
sizes and it will fit most people

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
of course especially in the pandemic

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
it's important to have

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
a masculine fistula but since it's only

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
one measurement that you take into

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
account you you can get away with just

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
making two sides and most people fit

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
them

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
let's see

131
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
but then you have more complicated

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
patterns like dress shirts which can

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
easily take more than 10 measurements

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
so something like this is harder to make

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
for multiple sizes

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
and

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
what clothing stores do

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,759
is they just

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,199
make the pattern based on their

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
mannequin and they grade it up and down

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
but this isn't how bodies work

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
this doesn't accompany

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
plus-sized bodies for example

144
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,840
and

145
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
and um sewing patterns actually if you

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,720
already sew close and you buy a sewing

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
pattern these are also often

148
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
based on a mannequin so even if you sew

149
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,759
your own clothes you may still run into

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
this problem

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,240
so

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,440
between stores sizes also vary wildly

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
as you can see

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
size 8 different stores have different

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
ideas of what that looks like

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
and there's another problem vanity

157
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
sizing is what this is called

158
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,039
um

159
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,840
it's

160
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
clothing stores they label their

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
garments as a smaller size because they

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
know their consumers will feel flattered

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
by wearing something that's a small size

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
and this makes it even harder these two

165
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,830
things to find clothes that fit you

166
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,940
[Music]

167
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,919
and it goes beyond finding your size as

168
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,440
well

169
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,199
what clothing stores do or the fashion

170
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
industry in general

171
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
is

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
trends trends

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
exist to make more money they know if

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
consumers feel out of date they will buy

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,840
more clothes

176
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,759
um this is mainly the case with women's

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
wear

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
so with fashion trends being pumped out

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
every few months or even every month

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,440
clothing stores don't get the time to

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
make sure their garment fits properly

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
so

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
they would rather just turn out close

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,199
quick fast more

185
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
then make sure they fit properly

186
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,319
so it's not just a sizing issue

187
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,039
it's also the clothing stores know that

188
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
they're selling garments that don't fit

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
properly

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
and this hurts them too

191
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,319
because

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
the most common problem or reason that

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
people return their clothes

194
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,599
is because of a bad fit and it takes a

195
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
lot of money for these companies to

196
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
cover those costs

197
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
and

198
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
if you return a garment it doesn't even

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
get resold it just gets thrown away so

200
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
it costs a lot of money a lot of

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
pollution but

202
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
clothing source

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
would rather just do that and keep up

204
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
with trends and actually properly make

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
clothes

206
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
at least in the fast fashion world

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
so a good fit

208
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
is important if you want to look your

209
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,839
best

210
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
but it can be very expensive to buy made

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
to measure clothes

212
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,680
or to get your clothes tailored

213
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,720
so

214
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
what can you do

215
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
free sewing is sorry that comes into

216
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
play

217
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
the founder yost he wanted to make made

218
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
to measure patterns more accessible

219
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
because it can be very hard and can take

220
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
a lot of time to make patterns that fit

221
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,519
your body

222
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
with a platform like free sewing it

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
becomes easier to make clothes that fit

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,399
you that actually properly fit you and

225
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,800
that are of good quality because you

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
make them yourself

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
unless you up

228
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
and you can make clothes in your own

229
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
style as well you don't have to rely on

230
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
whatever is trendy at the moment

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
you

232
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,360
or you don't have to rely on some niche

233
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
site in the far away corners of the

234
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
internet you can just make it yourself

235
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,479
and make what you want to wear

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
so but there is a lot more wrong with

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
the fast fashion industry

238
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
than just sizing

239
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
we have

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
exploitation

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
pollution environment problems climate

242
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
change mental health

243
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
it's it's not just sizing

244
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
um but this this isn't a talk about the

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,959
fashion industry

246
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
but this is important to keep in mind

247
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,519
because

248
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,880
does free sewing tackle those issues

249
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
it tries to at least

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
but it's very ambitious to expect people

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
to go and make their own clothes of

252
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,279
course because it takes a lot of time

253
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,959
and effort resources

254
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
but making made to measure patterns

255
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
accessible to the world

256
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
it's a good start

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
it makes it more accessible for people

258
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,640
to mend their clothes when there's a

259
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
hole in it instead of throwing those

260
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,519
clothes away

261
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,320
or

262
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
tailoring your own your own clothes that

263
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
you already have into things that

264
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
actually fit you

265
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
and it also enables sewists to um

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,800
make

267
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,680
clothes

268
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
made to measure patterns maybe they

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
don't know how to draft a pattern to

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
someone's measurements and they can just

271
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
use free sewing and then make and sell

272
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
these made to measure pestiment

273
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,040
patterns

274
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,079
it even makes it more accessible to

275
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
stores

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
someone in our discord server or chat

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
room

278
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
has been occasionally sharing

279
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,600
updates of his projects

280
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
after summer

281
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
he's

282
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
opening a pop-up store

283
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,519
in london

284
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
where people can get measured

285
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
and right then right there and there

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,399
a shirt will be made

287
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
based on those measurements

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
and this system is based on free sewing

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
system

290
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
so here are some other things that i

291
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
think the world could pick up on from

292
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
free sewing

293
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
so first up inclusivity

294
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,839
instead of dividing patterns between

295
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,360
menswear and women's wear or masculine

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
or feminine free sewing is

297
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,639
gender neutral or it tries very hard to

298
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,800
be

299
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
we also don't when we ask for

300
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
measurements we don't do men women

301
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,720
it's genderless is we ask with breasts

302
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,279
or without breaths breasts because

303
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
breasts do impact the fit of a garment

304
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,639
significantly

305
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,920
so

306
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
recycling parts

307
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
with free sewing you can just

308
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
take one part using another pattern

309
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,519
whereas if you're a sewing company

310
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
you can't really get away with doing

311
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,399
that

312
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,480
you're expected to make new patterns

313
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
and you can even remix an

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
existing pattern into a new one and this

315
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
is completely okay nobody will

316
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,399
call you out for that

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,079
third up there is no worries of trends

318
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
there is not a there isn't a hungry

319
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
audience waiting for a brand shiny new

320
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
pattern every month

321
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,440
we don't have to worry about

322
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
fitting into these boxes of modern

323
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,199
sewing patterns or this or that

324
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,399
so it's

325
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,440
it's designers they can make what

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
they're passionate about they don't have

327
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,760
to worry about all those things

328
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
so the patterns that get made

329
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,079
they're made in people's free time and

330
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,040
are made out of passion

331
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,639
so because of this free sewing also has

332
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
a lot of historical patterns aside from

333
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
just

334
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
everyday ones and we even have

335
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,160
patterns for

336
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
stuffed animals now

337
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
so

338
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,839
you know the ikea shark that's really

339
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,639
popular if

340
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
ikea lets you down and discontinue that

341
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,040
you can just make your own because we

342
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
have a new one right now it's a new

343
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,160
pattern

344
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,959
and

345
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,239
free sewing won't let you down

346
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
but there are a few limitations to free

347
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
sewing

348
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
so although it's a great start to make

349
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
patterns based on measurements this way

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
it

351
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,279
some patterns still have trouble to

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,440
support some types of bodies like plus

353
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
sized ones or those there will use a

354
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
wheelchair

355
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,480
or

356
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,639
a different posture or children

357
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
measurements can take all these factors

358
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,839
into account

359
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,360
because whereas in the fashion industry

360
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
a pattern designer drafts their clothes

361
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,199
on

362
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
an ideal body that doesn't exist

363
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
here

364
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
a pattern also has to be dropped on the

365
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
body which is often in free sewing the

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
designer themselves

367
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,959
which may which may

368
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,279
be hard to take other bodies into

369
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,760
account that way

370
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
so although

371
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
it's a great start and a lot of patterns

372
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,279
can

373
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
support a lot of bodies

374
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,360
measurements don't fix all sizing issues

375
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
then second up measurements itself can

376
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
be a problem as well

377
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
because you need to take the

378
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
measurements yourself and you may not

379
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
have a measuring tape or a friend to

380
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
help you

381
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
so it's it's easy to get measurements

382
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
wrong and that will also get the pattern

383
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,519
to drafts wrong

384
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,880
so that is

385
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,759
one limit of free sowing

386
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,839
aside from that free sowing relies

387
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,160
completely on volunteers

388
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
which is which is great it's not a

389
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,399
problem

390
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
but it does make things inconsistent

391
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
sometimes

392
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
free sewing doesn't grow the same way

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,160
the average sewing pattern company does

394
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
so let's jump into the technical aspects

395
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
of a free sewing pattern because after

396
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,079
all that's what this conference is about

397
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,319
um

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
this is a graph of everything that goes

399
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,440
into a free sewing pattern

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,399
so

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,399
it's made the same way you would make a

402
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
sewing pattern on paper you draw lines

403
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
very simply put

404
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
in this

405
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,599
case paths

406
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,399
and with for sewing you draw those lines

407
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,759
with javascript and coordinates

408
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
coordinates points here

409
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,479
yeah points

410
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,920
and these coordinates

411
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
they depend on what the designer the

412
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
measurement designer chose and the

413
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
options the designer chose

414
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
config

415
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
and of course

416
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
the measurements the user puts in and

417
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,519
the preference

418
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
that the user puts in settings

419
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
then what's left is store

420
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
this is where a designer can store

421
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
information so multiple parts of one

422
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
pattern can use that information

423
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
and snippets

424
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,759
if you

425
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,559
make

426
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,400
a lot of pants for example pants

427
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,039
patterns you're not going to make

428
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,240
a button

429
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,599
a graph every time you're not going to

430
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,000
coat that every time you make pants

431
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
so snippets are small often reused parts

432
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,959
of a sewing pattern that you can just

433
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
easily get out there

434
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,439
so then points paths snippets make up

435
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
one part of a sewing pattern for example

436
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
the sleeves

437
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,600
if you make multiple parts there's your

438
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,559
free sewing pattern

439
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
so these patterns are

440
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,840
scalable vector graphics also known as

441
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,440
svgs most of you probably already know

442
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
what that is but i'll explain it quickly

443
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,960
for those who don't know

444
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
so you don't actually draw a line made

445
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
of made up of a row of pixels because if

446
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
you resize that change it around it will

447
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,559
get blurry and unusable

448
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,120
instead the line is based on a starting

449
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
point and an end point which will always

450
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,640
make just a nice crisp line

451
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
and you can just add control points

452
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
the line will change but it will still

453
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
be crisp sharp

454
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
so these svgs are can be downloaded then

455
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
into pdfs by the user can also be

456
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,240
rendered into the browser with react

457
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
so in open source

458
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
communities it's easy to tunnel vision

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,799
into

460
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,840
code contributions and

461
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,120
progress um

462
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,280
and not other ones like documentation

463
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,240
but with resewing you really can't get

464
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
away with that with slacking on these

465
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,120
non-code contributions

466
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
because if you don't have the sewing

467
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
instructions you can't sew the pattern

468
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,879
unless you're an expert but

469
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
you may have a perfect technical drawing

470
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,240
but if you don't know what it looks like

471
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,360
on a real human person then you're also

472
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
missing information

473
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
so this is what also goes into a free

474
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,320
sewing pattern

475
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,159
so of course free sewing plans to grow

476
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,280
contributors

477
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,799
that don't know code

478
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,120
can also help with the previously

479
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,080
mentioned

480
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
parts

481
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
because

482
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,000
i think free sewing is a great way for

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
people to get familiar with open source

484
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
projects

485
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
but

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
without having to do code

487
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
so i think free sewing is the perfect

488
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
combination of art and code i think the

489
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,840
two can really thrive

490
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,120
here so free sewing plans to grow

491
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
and one of the things we've been

492
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
focusing on is making patterns more

493
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
inclusive like the flaw i mentioned that

494
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
some bodies are still not supported by

495
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
some patterns

496
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
we've been figuring out ways discussing

497
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
how to fix this

498
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
and we've been making progress but

499
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
there's still a long way to go

500
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,559
and then another type of inclusivity as

501
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
well we're trying to get away from

502
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,400
gendered language as much as possible

503
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,360
free sewing has a new version on its way

504
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,080
version 3.

505
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,678
a big focus of that is um

506
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
is

507
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,360
a better user experience so not only a

508
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
fast and intuitive site would be nice

509
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,200
but also to improve how people can use

510
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,720
our patterns because um sometimes things

511
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
aren't clear

512
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,799
on how to use it and

513
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,559
with better clarifications that

514
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
and there's a lot more coming in version

515
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
three that um that's too technical for

516
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,600
me that i don't understand

517
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,039
and then last

518
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
we also want to show more appreciation

519
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
to for contributors

520
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
for different types of contributions

521
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
we've already made a huge step by adding

522
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
the all contributors page to github

523
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
which shows all the contributors and all

524
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
the things that they do

525
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,720
but we're all also trying to

526
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
make contributors more visible on the

527
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,360
site itself so if you go to a patterns

528
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
page

529
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,880
it's not just designer and the name but

530
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
there's also information there

531
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,080
so that was free sewing

532
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
don't hesitate to stop by if you have

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,799
any ideas

534
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,918
thank you thank you

535
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,799
[Music]

536
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,240
great

537
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,559
thank you very much for your talk now i

538
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
want to encourage people to line up uh

539
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
at the microphone in the middle to ask

540
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
questions uh but first we want to check

541
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
and see

542
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,159
um

543
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,039
well okay i guess we don't have uh right

544
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
we don't have a signal question

545
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
but i do have a question that was asked

546
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
by some of members of my village who

547
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,919
really wanted to come um

548
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,480
are there are there ways that this um

549
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
this approach deals with the natural

550
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,280
asymmetries in the human body

551
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
yeah that is also uh one part

552
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,679
um for example shoulder slope has

553
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
can be very asymmetrical most people

554
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
that's the case

555
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
um so there are guides on that but that

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,840
is also part of the supporting different

557
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,000
bodies asymmetry yeah

558
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
great would you like to ask the first

559
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
question yes

560
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
great project great talk thank you

561
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,039
i was wondering

562
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
have any of you already

563
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,600
been experimenting with simulating

564
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
different types of fabric

565
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
for instance with the cloth material in

566
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
bender

567
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
or sorry blender

568
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,159
that's a good one

569
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,240
we've been talking about it but it's

570
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
mostly been like a far away

571
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,080
idea that we could do but it's it's very

572
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,799
hard to actually put into code and have

573
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,159
users

574
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,760
use it

575
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
but um

576
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,799
yeah fabric is very important for

577
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
patterns of course

578
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
and there

579
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
we also take that into account

580
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
um but yeah that is something that we

581
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,039
are looking forward to in the future

582
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,280
thank you

583
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
hi um i was wondering how big the

584
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,640
community and the database of python is

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
at the moment

586
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,679
sorry can you repeat that how big is uh

587
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,159
how many are you contributing to the

588
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
project at the moment and how many

589
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,480
patterns are available on the website

590
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,640
so

591
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,919
if you have a rough id

592
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,440
uh sorry i don't understand your

593
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
question

594
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,039
the size of the community am i if i'm

595
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,559
getting this right the size of the

596
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,559
current community using this

597
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
um sorry um yeah it's uh um in the

598
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
discord there are a few thousand people

599
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
i think

600
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,520
but it's it's not as big as the average

601
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,279
sewing company

602
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
or average sewing communities it's

603
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,919
still pretty small

604
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,320
thank you

605
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,320
next question all right thank you um

606
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
i am terrible i have two left hands

607
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,480
there's no way that i'll ever accomplish

608
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
something like this have you seen any

609
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,240
integration into automated

610
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,279
ways to actually get these patterns on

611
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,320
yeah so

612
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,360
um that's a good one um

613
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,279
that's uh the mention of that guy who's

614
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,360
doing a pop-up store for example

615
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,080
um so that would be nice if stores could

616
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
do this that would probably be

617
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
one of the solutions to exploitation in

618
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
the fashion industry as well

619
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
but free sewing is mostly about the

620
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
patterns itself and users who can use

621
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,559
that or stores

622
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,840
so thank you

623
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,880
i'm standing on my toes um so this

624
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
relates to the measurements um have you

625
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,679
already investigated if could if you

626
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,640
could perhaps use 3d scanning so

627
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
somebody takes a picture of the person

628
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,159
all around

629
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
and use that to generate a 3d map of the

630
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
person and get all the measurements have

631
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
you looked at it that would be thank you

632
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,440
for the question that would be one of

633
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,559
the

634
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,559
things that could really help with the

635
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
struggle to support different types of

636
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
bodies

637
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
um but it's really hard to actually do

638
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
that and put it into

639
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
a practice

640
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
and

641
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,159
with what we already have but it's it's

642
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,559
definitely something for in the future

643
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,559
to take inspiration from

644
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,760
maybe work towards

645
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,679
there have been people actually who have

646
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,880
in the server who have mentioned that

647
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,240
before so maybe

648
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
i actually have two they're very small

649
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
ones uh one is there also a tutorial on

650
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,400
how to measure properly because you may

651
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,559
yeah that is there as well

652
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,480
and um

653
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
now i'm forgetting the other one

654
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
um

655
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
had to do with uh

656
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,880
oh yeah i remember it again

657
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
um it's probably also a very generic one

658
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
i'm completely new to sewing but

659
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,320
uh

660
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
if if you don't have a printer or if you

661
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,559
only have us

662
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,279
uh one that can do 3d no

663
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
a4 sorry

664
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
but is that

665
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
going to be a problem

666
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
thank you very quick this is a good

667
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
question um

668
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
so um

669
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,080
we have a tyler that does um

670
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
converts the pattern into

671
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
a4s but also other sizes

672
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
and there's also a pattern

673
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
it's a paperless version

674
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
um which

675
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,480
shows

676
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,200
all the distances of the pattern

677
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,159
um

678
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,559
i can maybe use visual aid for this

679
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,200
so there's a

680
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
paperless version that says like this is

681
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
this long this is that long this is that

682
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,919
long and you can just convert it onto

683
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,159
paper yourself

684
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
thank you

685
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
you say it's difficult to take

686
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
measurements and it's always a bit

687
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,840
confusing indeed because you're working

688
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
on your own body something that really

689
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
worked for me i don't sew a lot but

690
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,200
something that really worked for me is

691
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
just take something that fits well and

692
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,559
measure that size

693
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,200
or for t-shirts i once put pins in it

694
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
and just copy that

695
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
that would work as well yeah

696
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
yeah the thing is for taking uh clothes

697
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
is that yeah they're close um

698
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,760
but yeah if you would pin that to your

699
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
body that would be one of the ways to

700
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
make it more easy for people

701
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,520
um

702
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
but the average person that has trouble

703
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,640
with measurements are

704
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,960
how do they say this people who are not

705
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
familiar with measurements so also not

706
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
really familiar with

707
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
pinning to your body for example thank

708
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
you

709
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,279
and uh

710
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
one last question for you uh

711
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,120
from from the same folks who really

712
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,720
wanted to come

713
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
what is the iteration model for trying

714
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
to improve either as a designer who's

715
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
contributing or

716
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,919
one who is cutting to to use these

717
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,000
patterns uh to get

718
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,480
like over time to to target

719
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
better fit

720
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,640
what the main uh

721
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
goal is you mean

722
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
how do um

723
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
typically do people

724
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
improve their um

725
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
the patterns so that they they work

726
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
better in the future from

727
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
uh you know from from the community and

728
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,679
from feedback

729
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,840
oh code

730
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,399
um

731
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
yeah so it's

732
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,159
patterns get improved when people come

733
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,240
to us in the server and they say this

734
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
doesn't fit me this doesn't work for my

735
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,880
body

736
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,679
and

737
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,480
the designer and the person they

738
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
look

739
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,360
at what's going on and how to fix it how

740
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,559
to improve it

741
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
and

742
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,919
um just

743
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
doing it a lot also helps improve

744
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
thank you thank you very much and uh we

745
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,799
have just time for one last final

746
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,679
question

747
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
very quick uh small question the

748
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
percentages on this slide are those that

749
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
you fill in yourself or those calculated

750
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,679
based on your measurements

751
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,279
percentages on on this exact slide

752
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,279
because i oh for myself i wouldn't know

753
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,880
how many percent chest ease i would need

754
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,200
if that makes sense

755
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,799
yeah so um

756
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,840
these are the standard

757
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,000
versions so it's also that you can make

758
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,919
the percentage smaller and the east will

759
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,240
become less so it will become tighter um

760
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,279
so it's

761
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,600
it's just uh the standard percentages

762
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
for a pattern that you can also make

763
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,320
smaller

764
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
does this make sense

765
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
these are the defaults if that makes

766
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,120
sense yes all right cool

767
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,360

768
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
