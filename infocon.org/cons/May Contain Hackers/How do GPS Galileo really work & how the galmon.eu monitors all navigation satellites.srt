2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,960
thank you

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,520
so I hope to tell you a little bit about

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,740
this little magic thing whereby your

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,140
phone always knows where you are and why

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,480
advertisers also always know where you

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,140
are

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,480
and it's actually a sort of miracle

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,580
and I tried to summarize this talk on

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,380
Twitter two days ago and I came up with

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,239
this

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,000
um Global navigation systems consist of

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,520
100 spacecrafts that beep at you

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,960
it turns out this is actually true

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,460
that's what they do

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,320
and but the surprise already there is

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,780
why are there 100s because that's like a

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,899
lot and um but they don't only beep at

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,539
you they beep at you with a very precise

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,920
frequency

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,039
exactly once every one point zero zero

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,199
zero zero zero zero zero seconds it's

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,420
actually nine zeros in a row it's like

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,940
pretty precise stuff so if you could be

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,220
able to listen to all these Satellites

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,439
with your own ears right now you would

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,740
like 33 of them one-thirds is actually

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,720
reaching us right now and if you would

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,740
put it on speaker it would sound like

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,900
foreign

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,119
listens to the noises and says you are

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,580
at MCH it's like really nice

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,520
and uh

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,100
this yeah there's a sound again uh the

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,840
prop is not enough to know where you are

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,299
The Satellites also tell you where they

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,619
are

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,020
and if you know where the satellites are

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,079
and you measure the timing of the you

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,479
can calculate where you are it's nice

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,460
it's pretty nice stuff

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
and um

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,259
oh and there is no authentication on

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,780
this at all in any way

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,820
so these signals that come to us from

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,799
space they are like really weak they're

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,780
actually so weak they are weaker than

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,060
they are below the noise floor

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
that means that if someone else also

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,100
transmits these signals state they're

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
quite credible and strong and you could

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
maybe transmit like oh I don't know 40

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,919
kilometers

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,220
of fake GPS signals and this has been

55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,840
keeping keeping people busy for a long

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
time now and finally there are some

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
solutions

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,760
uh is another way of thinking about this

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,620
hundred spacecraft that beep at you so

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,319
that Google can track you all day and

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,819
actually Google is currently one of the

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,540
innovators in having multi-frequency uh

63
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,940
GPS which allows you to not only locate

64
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,099
where the user is but also exactly which

65
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,680
shop window in front he is staying so

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,180
that's nice

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,420
that's nice I shared it on Twitter

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,160
and people set this 100 spacecraft

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,739
beeping at you stuff is not complete

70
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,379
it is actually 100 very good atomic

71
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,239
clocks yelling the time at you from

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,440
space

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,660
uh which is also true

74
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,459
so there are many ways to think about

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,620
this stuff so now let's let's start with

76
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,440
the granddaddy of them all GPS

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,300
um and this is such a problem that

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,019
people GPS was was the first one by a

79
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,200
few years and GPS now actually stands

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,819
for the whole satellite navigation

81
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,159
technology and you have to spend some

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,959
time thinking about those poor Russians

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,239
and Europeans and Chinese people also

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,800
having their own satellite navigation

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
systems and everyone says oh you are

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
working on GPS

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,940
now that's the American stuff

88
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,060
been around now it is pretty good it's

89
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,799
also very old it's like extremely old

90
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,560
when they build GPS

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,780
GPS is amazing technology and it's all

92
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,459
the more amazing if you realize they

93
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,940
started in 1973. the spec has been

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,239
developed since 1973 and parts of it are

95
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,159
sort of hard to read by now

96
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,720
because they are very much operating

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
from sort of electrical engineering

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
perspective so we think in terms of

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,599
sending bits and bytes

100
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,659
and they really talk about voltages

101
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,760
and uh and then I have a picture that

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,379
shows that next up

103
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,280
um GPS is extremely reliable and also

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,860
extremely boring they almost never

105
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,019
change anything when they change

106
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,760
something there it takes them like 12

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
years the Key Systems are like on eight

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
inch floppy disks still

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,320
and and everyone is worried that the GPS

110
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,779
ground segment will one day just implode

111
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,860
because it's literally full of well

112
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,500
grandfather software they're really old

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,840
people working on GPS but

114
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,440
um

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,479
it was the first so we can forgive it a

116
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,880
few things there is no forward error

117
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,639
correction on GPS there is a super

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,440
stupid parity

119
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,620
on the GPS signals and that is so bad

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,259
that you will every day you will get

121
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,600
signals that pass all the parity checks

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,220
and are still wrong

123
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,139
simply because the parity check is so

124
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,820
weak that if you make two mistakes it

125
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,680
goes like wow now it's good again

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
and um but I mean

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
GPS is like this reliable piece of

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,780
technology that has been there it never

129
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,180
breaks it's never very good

130
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,600
because it's not the most precise system

131
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,060
but it's also never very bad so which is

132
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,919
oh it's nice

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,600
um there are political elements to GPS

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,880
the American government used to degrade

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,460
the GPS performance

136
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,820
um and they turned that off in 1992

137
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,460
but since then they have also apparently

138
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,039
degraded it in specific regions of the

139
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,620
world sometimes it's hard to get proof

140
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,300
for this stuff because it happened

141
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,580
before the big monitoring projects that

142
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,259
we have now

143
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,240
um but there is this this feeling that

144
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,340
GPS is a military project and I can

145
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,259
confirm to you that is that is the case

146
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,360
if you try to talk to these people

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,580
they come back with with all kinds of

148
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,080
forms and and they're sort of even

149
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,699
annoyed that you talk to them and they

150
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,460
have a special division for civilians

151
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,259
that civilians can talk to and those

152
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,819
people I don't know they don't talk to

153
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,440
the rest I think

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,139
um and this has escalated at times it

155
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,780
was not possible to visit the GPS status

156
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,979
page

157
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,440
because it was Secret

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,539
and they found a construction where they

159
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,580
found a volunteer and they told him the

160
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
situation and he would then suddenly put

161
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,180
that on his website

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,280
it's weird so but

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,380
the GPS is clearly a military project

164
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,720
but it's super reliable it's never super

165
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,580
good but it's always It's The Old

166
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,199
Faithful

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,479
there's some mystery issue around it

168
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,520
um there are classified parts of the GPS

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
protocol that that you sometimes see

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,180
referenced

171
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,979
and then you hear nothing more about it

172
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,479
ever again and and I also do not ask and

173
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,620
the other mystery about the GPS

174
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,340
satellites is that they are huge they're

175
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,560
like five times as big as Galileo

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,139
satellites which is the European GPS and

177
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,759
no one knows why

178
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,680
and so it might be that the GPS

179
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,259
satellites can have rockets and can

180
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,780
evade attacks I don't know but something

181
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,699
has to be in all those thousands of

182
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,259
kilos no we don't know

183
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
ah this is you see this at the beginning

184
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,780
of documents you always see these

185
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,280
hopeful tables where people fill out

186
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
revisions and stuff and they never do

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
the GPS people do

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,720
and this document has been going since

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
1983. you can just download it and it

190
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,500
explains how GPS works and it has all

191
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,720
these kinds of this tables and this is a

192
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,819
sort of an example of what I mean by by

193
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,160
how different these people live you see

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,220
that this is a a sort of schema of a of

195
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,840
a GPS message

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
and um and you see that on top of this

197
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
direction of data flow from space

198
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,160
vehicle

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,259
so they actually tell you that the the

200
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,740
data will come in in this order so it's

201
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,840
not just a message and it tells you how

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,340
to parse the message it actually tells

203
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,379
you how the message will arrive all

204
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,020
those letters P you see in between are

205
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,639
parity bits

206
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,259
and for some reason they put all the

207
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,720
parity bits between the other bits

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,539
which makes it pure hell to parse yeah I

209
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,639
see some people are like shocked but

210
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,020
apparently they had a great reason for

211
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,599
this and I don't know what it is some of

212
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,419
these bits are also uh must be are not

213
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,220
defined but it turns out that if the if

214
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,479
they change that something interesting

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,340
is going on so you can sort of have a

216
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,699
lot of fun looking at these messages

217
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,599
Russia

218
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,280
and

219
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,699
Russia had its because the U.S had GPS

220
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,000
Russia also had had to have a system

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,020
and these people were really Advanced

222
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,760
it's it's we sometimes may think are

223
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,380
these Russians and their their rockets

224
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,179
explode and whatever now they had their

225
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,039
own space shuttle shuttle projects which

226
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,500
were super Advanced and they had glonas

227
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,958
which is also super Advanced and you can

228
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,880
tell how good it is it survived the fall

229
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,100
of Communism they built it in the Soviet

230
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,800
Union it's a real Soviet Union system if

231
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
you see the old specs it has Hammers and

232
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,260
circles on it and um and then during the

233
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,580
fall of the communism they didn't have

234
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,500
any money to maintain it anymore so and

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,600
if the satellites started failing and

236
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,279
then when they struck oil and we started

237
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,860
paying them again they rebuilt all their

238
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,839
satellites and now with the war in

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,339
Ukraine they are even expanding the

240
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,839
network

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
so it's a very serious system

242
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,019
all the other navigation systems are

243
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,440
sort of copies of GPS they work the same

244
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
way use the same tricks same mathematics

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
and the Russians they they just did it

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,560
differently and I'm not sure if it's

247
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,540
wise they did some very extremely

248
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,860
strange things

249
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,440
one of the strangest things

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,140
is that GPS and all the other systems

251
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,220
run on a simple time Scale based on the

252
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,820
number of seconds since the epoch and

253
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,800
Epoch which is the same way of doing it

254
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,660
because that means you do not have to

255
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,180
worry about leap seconds you do not have

256
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,920
to worry about Daylight Saving

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,500
everything is a lot simpler if you do it

258
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,880
a GPS way

259
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,300
glonass runs on actual wall clock Moscow

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,860
time

261
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,540
that means that if they do a leap

262
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,420
seconds the whole system has to

263
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,620
instantaneously adjust

264
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,839
they also for a period have summer and

265
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,700
winter time in Moscow which also really

266
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
did not help but at system Faithfully

267
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,459
broadcasts Moscow wall clock time

268
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,320
but because they thought that I don't

269
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,540
know UTC was a western imperialistic

270
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,820
invention or something I don't know

271
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,720
um

272
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,180
it's still around it has all kinds of

273
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,740
weird failures for which they blame the

274
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,640
West

275
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,399
and um still used though because it

276
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,720
works they have all kinds of

277
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
documentation for it and it's sort of

278
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,779
fun to read it they have different

279
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,700
variants of the documentation some are

280
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,620
very ugly and these turn out to be

281
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,779
correct and there are prettier versions

282
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,839
of the documentation and these are wrong

283
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,019
um I encountered this formula in there

284
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,880
because I want to calculate something

285
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,920
about Lonas and it says this is the

286
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,019
formula you need to use and this is like

287
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,760
so complicated

288
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,100
but I decided to give it a try anyhow

289
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,260
and it doesn't work so I asked one of my

290
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,820
Russian friends and he said all right

291
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,300
that formula is a joke no one uses it

292
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,040
and then because he's a really good

293
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
friend he implemented the correct

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,279
formula and submitted that to my project

295
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,680
so that's nice

296
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,540
the Chinese

297
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,800
um

298
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,620
they are I don't know this is like you

299
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,180
should we should all be very impressed I

300
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,040
think this is a sort of lesson in here

301
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,380
uh they have not one not two but three

302
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,399
Baidu systems and they innovate

303
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,740
extremely quickly and which also leads

304
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,240
to a lot of unhappy people on the ground

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,680
because suddenly the signals are

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,420
different and they no longer work

307
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,240
but the new signals are just better

308
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,760
and in in a very short amount of time

309
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
they iterated to A system that appears

310
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,899
to be much better than what we have

311
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,300
they have more satellites in more orbits

312
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,079
they use more frequencies than

313
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,940


314
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,560
but we can use it we can appreciate it

315
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,120
but there is a lesson in there for us

316
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,220
that where GPS and Galileo take like

317
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,060
five years to plan an iteration by that

318
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,620
time the Chinese people have done three

319
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,540
already

320
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,920
they used to be very open and

321
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,959
Cooperative so they used to be part of

322
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,139
all the international gnss bodies and

323
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,920
that is now less so the case and uh and

324
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,019
it's also sort of becoming unclear how

325
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,700
it all works this is from the Wikipedia

326
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,880
and you see the many many ways Baidu

327
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,100
transmit signals here

328
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,959
every column is one way and there are

329
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
now question marks in some of these

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,380
columns because part of it is no longer

331
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,920
documented uh or no longer known so it's

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,680
going a bit dark on Baidu

333
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,180
but still it's a very impressive

334
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,959
achievement

335
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,560
Europe Europe also has a gnss system

336
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
so we have our own navigational needs

337
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,820
and this was initially started because

338
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,279
we were a bit worried about GPS because

339
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,399
the US can always turn off GPS and then

340
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,500
Europe would have to rely on glonash

341
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,959
which they didn't like so they said we

342
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,480
need our own system and the US said no

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,620
you really don't

344
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,459
really you don't it's it's not necessary

345
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,079
um

346
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,339
and then they said yeah there are also

347
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,779
all kinds of technical reasons why you

348
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,760
should not be doing this and it's all

349
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,240
wrong that's bad even and they wrote

350
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,100
pretty nasty letters about this and this

351
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,560
led to a big fight and eventually and

352
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,260
actually the EU was such a mess at that

353
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,420
point that even if America had done if

354
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,560
they had done nothing we would have

355
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
probably given up on the project

356
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,360
uh but since the US hated it some people

357
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,740
in Brussels were like well maybe that

358
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,839
means we should do it

359
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,120
and um

360
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,579
and people suspected that spending

361
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,440
billions of Euros on this stuff because

362
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
they spent like 10 billion euros on it

363
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
and the large part would go to the

364
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,160
European Defense and Space Industries

365
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,839
and that would keep them alive because

366
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,519
we're not very good at investing in

367
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,800
space and defense here and turns out

368
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,420
this was probably true

369
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,240
so they spent 10 billion euros designing

370
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,220
and launching this this Galileo system

371
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,720
and now we have one and in hindsight

372
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
it's probably actually not the worst

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
idea to do it

374
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,579
um

375
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,980
is more precise than GPS there's more

376
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,800
frequent updates uh the modulation as

377
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,600
forward Arrow correction which is so

378
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
good that I have never seen a corrupted

379
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,860
message

380
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,779
uh the CRC check it's like super nice

381
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,459
and

382
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,399
um they're innovating

383
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,600
that's a nice clip they're actually

384
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,639
doing new things that no one else is

385
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,120
doing so in theory of all the navigation

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,880
systems when it works Galileo is the

387
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,260
very best

388
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,660
and it quite often does not work

389
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,040
and that's sort of where the problem

390
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,500
lies so if your GPS is like this super

391
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,019
reliable farm horse that will always do

392
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,600
what you want and uh in Galileo is like

393
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,339
this racehorse that you just you need to

394
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,380
keep him happy and and otherwise he

395
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,779
doesn't perform

396
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,980
and um

397
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,500
so and it's underpowered I didn't quite

398
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,260
launch enough satellites and some of

399
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,800
them broke in interesting ways and

400
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,639
um

401
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,860
when it breaks they say no no it's

402
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,000
normal

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
so they were like really good

404
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,839
bureaucrats so they defined uh so you

405
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,399
would say we have a satellite that it

406
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,440
works or if it doesn't work

407
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,600
and what they did is they defined an

408
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,880
in-between status where it actually also

409
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,360
does not work but you call it marginal

410
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,860
and and then you say that if the

411
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
satellite is marginal you don't have to

412
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,680
report on it

413
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,540
which means that your satellites can be

414
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,240
like super broken and you're like it's

415
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,279
all fine here

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
and they really believe that because I I

417
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,540
by now they they've I have lots of

418
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,160
contacts there and sometimes I tell them

419
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,860
look it's broken no no no no but it's

420
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,480
marginal

421
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,459
I said look my phone doesn't use it your

422
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,980
own documents tell everyone not to use

423
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,779
marginal satellites yeah but that's

424
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,339
their problem

425
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,440
no it's it's not good so how did that

426
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,060
happen how did it come that way and

427
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,860
prepare your mind because this is this

428
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,480
is going to suck

429
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,259
boom this is how Galileo gets governed

430
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,899
and um and I showed this to people and

431
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,459
they said no no it's not correct I said

432
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,459
oh yeah it's worse and um

433
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,459
and then also brexit happened and and

434
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,820
it's all not good and um and it's

435
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
actually sort of amazing how well it

436
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,519
works uh considering this and the only

437
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,259
reason that it works is because really

438
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,259
because of people like us real die-hard

439
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:31,620
Geeks that want to make it work so there

440
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,779
are people there that work for one part

441
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,180
of this diagram and they know the people

442
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,740
in the other part of the diagram and

443
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,120
they go like you need to do this right

444
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
now and then it works so this really

445
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,019
runs and I recently met one of these

446
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,420
guys and he's extremely modest but

447
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,160
without that single guy I don't think

448
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,860
Galileo would have worked and and he's a

449
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,720
real super nice engineer so I hope he

450
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,920
listens

451
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,079
thanks

452
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,279
so yeah

453
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,699
I'll make sure he watches the recording

454
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,959
so

455
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,480
um so maybe good to know people often

456
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,980
ask me that does anyone actually use

457
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,500
Galileo does anyone actually use Baidu

458
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,780
and and yes it turns out every phone

459
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,339
that you bought in the last few years

460
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,939
uses all these systems all the time

461
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,520
um Android phones will lovingly tell you

462
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,439
everything about each satellite they're

463
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,199
using and why notes and it's super nice

464
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,299
and and if you have Apple phone Apple

465
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,379
just says you are here

466
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,400
I don't know why I don't know how I

467
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
figured it out that you are here and and

468
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,840
that is so annoying for Apple users that

469
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,820
they actually are the sort of fake apps

470
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,980
that try to calculate what your Apple

471
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,080
phone is likely doing

472
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,960
if you want to do anything with GPS get

473
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,340
an Android phone

474
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,520
uh some Android phones accidentally have

475
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,620
extremely powerful chips that actually

476
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,380
can be used for geodetic purposes like

477
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,900
one centimeter resolution

478
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,360
which usually requires these big big

479
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,100
things with big antennas and now you can

480
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,679
just show up with your phone

481
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,620
um so all the phones try to use many as

482
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,900
many of these satellites as they can and

483
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,240
why do they do that when we sit in this

484
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,000
nice tent if you have an Android phone

485
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,820
you will probably see 25 satellites that

486
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,980
are being used right now for navigation

487
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,740
which is nice

488
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,840
if you are walking around in a city you

489
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
have buildings left and right from you

490
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,900
and you only see a small part of the sky

491
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,120
and your phone is in your pocket which

492
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,740
means that the half of the sky is also

493
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,880
gone so actually you have to realize

494
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,980
that your phone is listening to these

495
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,380
satellites from your pocket

496
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,720
and that means that it loves to start

497
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
with 33 satellites that it could maybe

498
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,240
receive and if it's lucky from your the

499
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
pocket from your pants it can see five

500
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
and that's enough to get a fix so that's

501
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,940
the actual reason why uh phone

502
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,059
manufacturers were so eager to use all

503
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,740
these new Satellite Systems so they can

504
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,200
track you better

505
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,039
um

506
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,039
there's an interesting case here

507
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,919
um the phone listens to the the Chinese

508
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,660
systems and the American systems the

509
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,160
European system and the Russian system

510
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
what if these systems say different

511
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,820
things

512
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,620
which could happen

513
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,260
there are algorithms in the phone that

514
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,080
then decide to maybe kick out glonache

515
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,880
because I say the glona system is the

516
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
outlier

517
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,299
uh so let's let's ignore that for a bit

518
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,640
or maybe one satellite is an outlier but

519
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
because you're receiving it via a

520
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,880
reflection

521
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,760
so there are also interesting algorithms

522
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,660
in there uh to get the best fix

523
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,559
but no one knows what would happen if

524
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,820
you

525
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,580
if GPS starts transmitting all kinds of

526
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,900
weird things

527
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,360
would the system then really would the

528
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,720
phones move over to Baidu and Galileo

529
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
and we don't know

530
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,340
because no one has ever tested this and

531
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,200
whenever I try to test something without

532
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,020
a GPS you find that software breaks

533
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,320
because GPS is always there it is always

534
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
on so many of these systems use GPS as

535
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,520
the backbone

536
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,440
so we don't really know what happens if

537
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,919
GPS fails and um more research is

538
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,900
clearly needed and I hope that you will

539
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,100
feel up to that

540
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
because it turns out that if you have

541
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,179
the right software-defined radio thing

542
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,840
you can actually send out GPS signals

543
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,659
do so at an extremely low

544
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,220
perform power level though because

545
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,720
otherwise you might get all kinds of new

546
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,919
friends

547
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,140
and um

548
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,059
but you can actually do this there are

549
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,100
these these hundred thousand Euro wrote

550
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,320
and Schwarz simulators which allow you

551
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,500
to simulate one GPS signal well it turns

552
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,780
out it is very doable to do this kind of

553
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,900
thing and no one knows how the world's

554
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,799
phones would react to strange signals so

555
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,299
then at one point

556
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,980
I asked some of the people in the

557
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,220
industry do you do any uh fishing

558
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,980
of signals do you know what what's the

559
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,320
chipsets would do and he said what is

560
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
physing

561
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,360
so then I explained it to them what it

562
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,740
means and he said oh no that would not

563
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,480
be necessary because the satellite would

564
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,500
not would not do that

565
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,380
oh okay

566
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,780
um that's good

567
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,059
um and I I got nowhere I really got

568
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,620
nowhere I said can you do some

569
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,419
experiments with the sort of malicious

570
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,299
signals could you maybe sort of insert a

571
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,419
fake satellite that slowly drifts but

572
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,559
could it maybe take the whole

573
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,260
constellation with it and they said yeah

574
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,419
super interesting subjects and can we

575
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,159
talk about something else

576
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,679
um so you can do this you can just do

577
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,140
this very weak signal have a software

578
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,380
defined radio there is gnss SDR which is

579
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,760
part of the new radio you can download

580
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,120
it it can create signals and I'm I

581
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,980
personally predict that if you start

582
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,539
fuzzing these systems they will just

583
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,440
crash

584
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,840
originally like superfin and the reason

585
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,720
why it's super fun is you could put your

586
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,220
software defined radio system somewhere

587
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,100
in an airplane or whatever

588
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,159
broadcast at a few watts and the blanket

589
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,039
out all Android phones

590
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,400
and not to give you any ideas of course

591
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,679
but but do fish this stuff because it's

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,940
unfirst

593
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,320
and we all know what happens when stuff

594
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,980
is in first

595
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,440
yeah use a faraday cage make one with

596
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,480
aluminum foil and just say I'm not kinky

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm just wrapped in aluminum foil

598
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,460
figure something out so we're going to

599
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,500
talk about the satellites what does a

600
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,380
GPS or gns satellite actually look like

601
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,360
this is a real one

602
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,880
this is a Galileo satellite and it's

603
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,340
it's sort of big but most of that stuff

604
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,740
is is solar panels that will fold out

605
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,960
and um

606
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,480
and it these this one has four Atomic

607
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,220
looks why does it have four atomic

608
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,700
clocks because they suck and they die

609
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,679
and uh I think if these people would

610
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,880
have a choice they would have launched

611
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,860
now with eight atomic clocks because

612
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,659
they actually break a lot

613
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,140
and um and what these clocks do every

614
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,500
second and really every second they send

615
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,320
out a message and that message might

616
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
Simply Be beep some of these messages

617
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,820
are nothing other than beep with other

618
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,980
ones actually contain information about

619
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,760
the orbits of the satellites or how well

620
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,620
is the atomic clock doing because it

621
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,659
turns out that atomic clocks are not as

622
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,460
magic as you might think they actually

623
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,260
drifts and they speed up and do all

624
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,299
kinds of things you need to monitor them

625
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,419
so the satellite transmits this is my

626
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,980
Orbit these are the corrections to my

627
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,840
Orbit this is where my clock is doing

628
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,659
and also statistics on cable lengths and

629
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,900
now you may wonder why does that matter

630
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,039
these systems transmit on different

631
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,200
frequencies the antenna is in one place

632
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,700
but there are different cable lengths

633
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,740
which means that the satellite on one

634
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,419
frequency appears to be a bit further

635
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,559
away from you

636
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
then on the other frequency and it turns

637
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,460
out all these satellites are individuals

638
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,960
and different so the system actually

639
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,480
says well there is like 12 centimeters

640
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,799
between this frequency and that

641
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,659
frequency and each satellite has its own

642
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,279
settings for that

643
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,860
it also tells you about the atmosphere

644
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,720
because it turns out the atmosphere can

645
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,059
like move you 10 meters

646
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,820
in delays so the satellite gives you all

647
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,260
kinds of information about the

648
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,600
atmosphere specifically ionosphere so

649
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,880
you can try to compensate for that

650
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,159
the system also gives you information

651
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,200
about its own health so the satellite

652
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
will say trust me or don't trust me or I

653
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,820
am marginal which is a status we

654
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,440
invented so we don't have to report to

655
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,020
the European Commission

656
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
um it also tells you about the dreaded

657
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,220
leap seconds

658
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,260
and these days it also sends out some

659
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,020
cryptographic authentication data in an

660
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,960
extremely weird way

661
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,659
um why do we even need to send orbit

662
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,020
updates because Kepler invented the laws

663
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,480
of elliptical orbits you could just say

664
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,279
this is the satellite's orbit and it's

665
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,659
going to stay in that orbit and nothing

666
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,760
is going to change that orbit and it

667
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,919
turns out I made this terrible graphic

668
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,980
because no one else made one apparently

669
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,299
you have the satellite and it's also

670
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,400
being attracted by the moon and it's

671
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,799
also being attracted by the Sun and

672
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,900
sunlight is shining on it trying to push

673
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,419
the satellite away and also and you can

674
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,400
barely see it on this graph the Earth is

675
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,440
not quite round it's a little bit flat

676
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,440
and it's also a bit lumpy and that also

677
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,720
means that the orbit of the satellite is

678
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,760
not quite an ellipse

679
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,860
doesn't differ that much from an ellipse

680
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,600
but it differs enough from the ellipse

681
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,980
that you would be on the other side of

682
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,880
the street

683
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,340
or even on the other side of your tongue

684
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,400
so it has to transmit all these life

685
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
updates

686
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,539
um

687
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,820
just very briefly of this one because I

688
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,340
think we realize how this works

689
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,980
the satellite beeps

690
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,080
it tells you where it is

691
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,360
that means that you know how far away

692
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
you are from the satellites

693
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,520
and if you receive signals from enough

694
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,860
satellites all the circles or actually

695
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,520
spheres intersect and you know where you

696
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,360
are

697
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,340
this is the sort of basic Theory and

698
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,779
this is actually the part that is that

699
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,460
people get right this is actually how it

700
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,880
does work

701
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,179
so how to get a fix the fix is by that

702
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,120
it says you are here and this is a Time

703
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
how to get that the satellites uh the

704
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,340
the phone or whatever gathers the

705
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,620
so-called pseudo ranges which are the

706
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,080
distances to all these satellites

707
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,659
and um and then it's corrects for

708
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,820
general relativity so people sometimes

709
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,220
say what good is general relativity how

710
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,720
does it would it ever impact my life

711
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,640
well it would you would your car would

712
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,559
impact things if we did not correct for

713
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,320
this and I'll get to that later

714
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,539
and a lot of math happens

715
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,880
and then in bold

716
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,340
dark arts happen

717
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,200
turns out if you just do these

718
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
calculations from scratch you will not

719
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,480
quite end up on the right location

720
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
there are lots of weird additions for

721
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,380
example you have to compensate for the

722
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,880
rotation of the Earth

723
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,860
because while the signal traveled down

724
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,740
from the sky the Earth rotated a little

725
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,240
bit and you want to know where you are

726
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,880
right now not where you were one and a

727
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,679
half seconds ago

728
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,240
um there's a lot of

729
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,460
real dark arts going when I do this when

730
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,799
I try to do this these calculations by

731
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,779
my by hand or at least my computer do it

732
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,600
I end up like with 20 meter accuracy and

733
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,919
I don't know how people get it any more

734
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,480
precise you really have to have a good

735
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,440
atmospheric model ionospheric model

736
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,059
understands some magic delays but it's

737
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,120
it's a lot of interesting stuff happens

738
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
now we're all used

739
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,260
did you get your phone and immediately

740
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,760
tells you where you are

741
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,380
of course the phone has a bit of History

742
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,419
it knows where you were

743
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,700
but we expect very rapid updates by now

744
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,799
first

745
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,360
before we know where we are we have to

746
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,620
listen to The Satellites so the

747
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,200
satellites can tell us where they are

748
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,320
it's an extremely low bandwidth Channel

749
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,140
so when we had the original Standalone

750
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,419
GPS receivers like these which are by

751
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,039
the way part of a small giveaway here

752
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,659
but I'll get to that

753
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,700
if you have a standalone GPS receiver it

754
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,919
might take like 10 minutes before it has

755
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,760
a fix

756
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,220
and it could even be like 20 minutes if

757
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,320
you're unlucky

758
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
but you can also download from the

759
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,279
internet a stream that already tells you

760
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,020
where all the satellites are

761
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,240
and how their clocks are doing which

762
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,500
means you only need to listen to the

763
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,659
beep and actually that is what phones

764
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:46,980
these days do

765
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,200
they download all the GPS information

766
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,960
from a server somewhere from Google

767
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,120
and that allows them to figure out where

768
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,159
they are within a few seconds

769
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,860
and you need to buy that data I

770
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,720
accidentally also generated such a

771
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,399
stream of data and suddenly people

772
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,620
started using it but I'll get to that

773
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,020
because it was also fun

774
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,120
but this way your phone is actually

775
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,340
geolocating itself using the internet

776
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,039
and with and the satellites it's no

777
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,260
longer on its own

778
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,880
so

779
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,679
um orbits and clocks

780
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,640
um

781
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,159
how often do you need an update before I

782
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,080
delved into this

783
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,480
a few years ago I thought that GPS might

784
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,580
need an orbit update once every three

785
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,080
months or so

786
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,539
because the orbits are stable enough and

787
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,039
it turns out that it's like every two

788
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,419
hours

789
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,640
or even every 20 minutes

790
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
so if you have old data on the orbit and

791
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
the clock Your Position will start to

792
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,740
drift rather quickly

793
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,720
and

794
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,240
that means that from the ground

795
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,640
people have to monitor the positions of

796
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,799
the satellite all the time

797
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,960
because we need to figure out why is the

798
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,059
satellite where is it is it one meters

799
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,919
too high because if the satellite is

800
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,600
flying one meter higher than we thought

801
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,580
it is that means that your position will

802
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,500
also shift one meter if you didn't know

803
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,340
that

804
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,380
so you need to figure out in real time

805
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,080
where all these satellites are

806
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,779
and how their clocks are doing

807
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,059
now there are monitoring stations around

808
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,679
the world that keep track of that that

809
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,720
listen to when the beeps come in and

810
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,080
It's Tricky work because if a clock on a

811
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,299
satellite goes beep a little bit early

812
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,520
that could mean that the clock is

813
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,159
running slightly too fast or that the

814
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,260
satellite is a bit lower and closer to

815
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,000
you than you thought

816
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
which really sucks because you would

817
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,539
like to know the difference and we'll

818
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,820
get to how hard that is because you need

819
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,620
to follow all these satellites and keep

820
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,700
state

821
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,500
and the experienced people already know

822
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,179
that keeping States is asking for

823
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,260
problems

824
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,480
so this is what these uh

825
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,539
these clocks look like the left one

826
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,159
actually looks like it could be quite

827
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,140
big and it's hard to get a sense of

828
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,940
scale but it's like this big and it

829
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,919
costs two and a half million euros

830
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,840
and it breaks

831
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,059
and it's made and actually the fun thing

832
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,440
is who do you think where do you think

833
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,559
the best clocks in Europe are made

834
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,159
in Switzerland it's actually true and

835
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,159
um it's a Swiss company and uh and they

836
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,620
make this one which is like a a hydrogen

837
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,539
Maser and it's like super good

838
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,360
especially when it works and on the

839
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,220
right is a more boring one this is a

840
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,860
rubidium standards and that one is also

841
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,460
good and but not as precise

842
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,140
so there are four there are two of the

843
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,820
the the major ones and two of the

844
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,279
rubidium ones on the Galileo satellites

845
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,019
and you have to realize three

846
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,080
nanoseconds is one meter

847
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,320
and in the top graph you can see the

848
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,539
drift rate from one of these clocks and

849
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,159
that is like one and a half milliseconds

850
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,519
per nanoseconds per hour

851
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,159
which is good if you know that uh and

852
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,960
you see that it's sort of oscillates

853
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,120
around an average which uh which has

854
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,820
complicated regions but if you did not

855
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,500
keep track of this you would be shifting

856
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,840
by one meter every two hours

857
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,360
which is not good so you really have to

858
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,860
keep track of that and this is by the

859
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,480
way one of the graphs that comes out of

860
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,720
my monitoring project

861
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,179
the relativistic correction and I love

862
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,480
this stuff if you are higher up there is

863
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,820
less gravity and time runs a little bit

864
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,799
faster which is fun when you study

865
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,059
Physics it's a tiny effect and it turns

866
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,820
out this tiny effect

867
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,640
also actually works on satellites but

868
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,399
they have a perfectly circular orbit so

869
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,380
they should never be higher

870
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,539
or lower they should be at the same

871
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,000
height all the time it turns out that

872
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,399
it's actually not true they go up 50

873
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,980
kilometers too much somewhere and that

874
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,899
is enough to completely mess up your

875
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:52,980
navigation

876
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,500
so on the grounds the system calculates

877
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,080
how much the relativistic effect has

878
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,659
been and compensates for that so thank

879
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,399
you Einstein

880
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,899
oh there he is

881
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,880
and um

882
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,960
well he didn't know but uh thank you

883
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,519
makes life a little bit more difficult

884
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,679
to just appreciate how hard the work is

885
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,559
that these people are doing

886
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,039
um when we listen to a GPS or Galileo

887
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,640
satellite what we hear is the antenna

888
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,039
that is the signal we receive

889
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,980
but it's not the antenna that is or in

890
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,559
orbit it's the center of mass of the

891
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,659
satellite that is in orbit

892
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,000
and these things are like one and a half

893
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,460
meters apart

894
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,559
oh who cares well actually there are

895
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
people that care about one and a half

896
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,059
meters and enabled to to enable real

897
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,399
good Precision you need to know the

898
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,899
difference between the center of mass

899
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,360
and the center of phase and the problem

900
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,740
now is that the people on the ground

901
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,419
that monitor the satellites they can

902
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,700
only hear the antenna they cannot hear

903
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,980
the center of mass that means that they

904
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,799
have an incredibly complicated model of

905
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,840
the mass distribution of the satellite

906
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,059
which they all weigh which actually

907
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,280
involves hanging up the Satellite by a

908
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,339
wire just to see how it hangs and and

909
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,320
then they may they keep a record of that

910
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,839
and compensate for that so that's how

911
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,460
and they also have to measure the cable

912
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,739
lengths of everything it's it's really

913
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,239
hard work

914
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,219
so they have to monitor the satellites

915
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,659
from all over the world

916
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,280
this is where the Galileo monitoring

917
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,619
centers are and that sounds really nice

918
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,659
and impressive Galileo Monitoring Center

919
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,000
and some of them are just in a field uh

920
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,619
and you can just go there

921
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,599
and uh and actually we have volunteers

922
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,219
in our project that actually do go there

923
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,679
and then take pictures and then security

924
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,540
guards come out and say why are you

925
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,599
doing that and uh and they're also yeah

926
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,699
just it's just in the field

927
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,679
and if anyone messes with that the whole

928
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,719
system goes down if you ask people where

929
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,879
are the GPS monitoring centers they all

930
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,440
go like

931
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,000
and we're not telling you

932
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,040
and the Galileo people are like well you

933
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,079
can maybe get a tour

934
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,520
um

935
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,440
so might this ever go wrong on this

936
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,859
complexity you know where this is going

937
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:11,339
uh in 2019 the whole Galileo system went

938
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,560
down

939
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,599
and not only did it go down the whole

940
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,700
administrative surroundings and

941
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,220
management also broke

942
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,680
so when the system was clearly down

943
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,800
there were these people doing this this

944
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,780
Buck dot uh presenter that there are no

945
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,540
problems with Galileo

946
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,500
Galileo is fine

947
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,960
and uh and I later found out that these

948
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,579
people were actually thought that that

949
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:36,720
was true

950
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,820
so the communications within the project

951
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,500
were so terrible

952
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,880
that they had these people going I was

953
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,380
like oh it's all good

954
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,380
how would I know and um and this this

955
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,180
lasted for seven days

956
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,060
which is like a tremendously bad so it

957
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,619
made CNN

958
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,980
and it made the register and then they

959
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,560
did a big review how could this possibly

960
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,740
go wrong and they ended up blaming one

961
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,979
guy

962
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,119
Einstein are you good you could blame

963
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,040
him maybe but no they blamed one system

964
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,720
administrator

965
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,940
and we all know how terrible it is

966
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,280
because if you build a system where one

967
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,140
system administrator could take down

968
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,300
everything down for seven days you

969
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,339
didn't do a good job it was not that one

970
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,960
person but they tried to blame this one

971
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,780
person I had become a little bit noted

972
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,119
in Galileo at that point so I made some

973
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,700
noise about that and it got picked up by

974
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,500
Politico which is a big Brussels

975
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,119
newspaper and then they said all right

976
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,400
it's not that one guy there were other

977
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,320
aspects as well

978
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,800
can we talk about something else

979
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,380
on Wikipedia outages in Galileo and in

980
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,099
2020 the same thing happened now what

981
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,900
actually happened there was I mentioned

982
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,800
to you how difficult it is to know

983
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
hello yeah I'm back if a satellite clock

984
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,140
is running a bit fast or if the

985
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,760
satellite is just a bit further away

986
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,040
from you or a bit closer that is a

987
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,079
degeneracy between these measurements

988
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,079
and the only way to disambiguate that is

989
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,720
to keep track of all the satellites so

990
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,460
you know what the state of the whole

991
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,200
system is that state does not only

992
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,960
include all the satellites in space but

993
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,300
also your bank of own atomic clocks

994
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,119
which also drift is to make life a bit

995
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,540
interesting and once you lose that state

996
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,760
the system at one point says I cannot

997
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,579
reconverge rapidly

998
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,579
I'm going to reconverge from scratch

999
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,260
which means that the system sits there

1000
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,380
and says how many satellites are there

1001
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,660
let's see how much I can hear and it

1002
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,359
takes 48 hours to reconverge

1003
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,180
and during that 48 hours you have no

1004
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,280
satellite system

1005
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,079
now this is so important that you might

1006
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,820
say why don't you have multiple

1007
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,700
instances of this software that tracks

1008
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,320
all these satellites

1009
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
and they do have multiple instances of

1010
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
exactly the same software

1011
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,540
and so when one breaks the other one

1012
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,720
goes like Oh I break too

1013
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,839
so we have full redundancy in braking

1014
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,880
and so so I had a meeting with them a

1015
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,640
few weeks ago and uh oh by the way the

1016
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,200
Galileo people they never officially

1017
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,579
talked to me they just take me out for

1018
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,760
really good food and um and then I'll

1019
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,200
explain why later because you might

1020
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
wonder but and and then they said I said

1021
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
why don't you have two copies of the

1022
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,240
software and he said no we have four of

1023
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
them I said yeah they're all exactly the

1024
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
same

1025
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,000
should we build another one then I said

1026
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,839
well maybe would be nice okay we're

1027
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,460
going to speed up because we're aware of

1028
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,300
time

1029
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,099
um when this big failure happened in

1030
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,040
2019 no one noticed

1031
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,020
really no one noticed Why did no one

1032
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,540
notice in 2019 not that many phones were

1033
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,820
using Galileo in the first place and the

1034
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,500
phones that were using Galileo just

1035
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,359
shifted back to GPS

1036
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,160
so no one really noticed and that's why

1037
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,140
that's good because it's redundant and

1038
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,839
nice the official people they said there

1039
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,480
is no incident or it's just a partial

1040
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,579
outage whatever now it was like the

1041
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,680
fullest outage ever

1042
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,260
and it was also no unofficial data

1043
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,540
because whenever we have people that

1044
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,300
monitor our power that monitor our oil

1045
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,060
pipelines our gas pipelines the the

1046
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,040
amount of sunlight we can find on the

1047
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,900
internet we can find monitors for

1048
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,400
everything

1049
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,619
not for Galileo no one had built

1050
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,420
anything because it was just too boring

1051
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,700
I think which meant that people could go

1052
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,320
around you could say no Galileo is fine

1053
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,700
it's always fine

1054
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,480
actually before the big outage in July

1055
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,160
when I found archives I found they had

1056
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,440
many more outages earlier just they

1057
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,300
hadn't told anyone about them

1058
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,859
and that's when I thought it might be

1059
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,960
good if we shine some sunlight on this

1060
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,859
situation

1061
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,780
can we monitor all these satellites

1062
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,940
easily and turns out you can

1063
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,520
this was the first receiver and uh

1064
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,500
goulash used to be in here a really good

1065
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,380
one and uh and then there's a Raspberry

1066
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,619
Pi zero in there with a very simple GPS

1067
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,480
receiver because it turns out there is

1068
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,119
one chipset that will not only tell you

1069
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,980
where you are but we'll also send you

1070
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,400
the raw gnss messages the new blocks

1071
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,520
they also switch by the way and uh and

1072
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,200
it's very nice of them so I found these

1073
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,160
things you could buy them online

1074
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,040
yeah yeah I'm back uh they were

1075
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,780
originally seven dollars there are now

1076
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,980
21 Euros which is wow okay uh but that's

1077
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,440
still very affordable

1078
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,240
the chip shortage the supply chain you

1079
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,300
know and um and we actually now in our

1080
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,160
Network so I started asking people can

1081
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,960
you join our Network can you buy one of

1082
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,359
these machines and uh and lots of people

1083
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,760
did we have now 80 receivers and I'll

1084
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,619
talk about a bit more but we have three

1085
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,619
orders of magnitude between the smallest

1086
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,300
the cheapest station which is based on

1087
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,099
this one and that thing on the right

1088
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,619
which is like a super high-end geodetic

1089
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,660
antenna which is actually part of the

1090
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,000
Dutch Reference Lab for this kind of

1091
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
stuff but they are nice enough to allow

1092
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,119
me access to it

1093
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,740
as long as I don't tell anyone

1094
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,079
this is MCH secret stuff so don't tell

1095
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,000
anyone so what do these receivers

1096
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,760
consist of a Raspberry Pi one of these

1097
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,040
machines and a very simple robust

1098
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,960
delivery protocol where all these

1099
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,000
receivers around the world send their

1100
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,520
data to two of my servers actually I am

1101
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,760
redundanced that way and not only is it

1102
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,280
redundant on my site they will also cue

1103
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,260
data internally and wait for

1104
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,880
acknowledgment that it was received

1105
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,579
successfully and this turns out this is

1106
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,079
people said this protocol is too simple

1107
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,359
you cannot do it and it runs Problem

1108
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,060
free for the past two years so this

1109
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,780
fills up terabytes of data and it now

1110
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,660
turns out that since we store every

1111
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,160
message and I think that's on the next

1112
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,720
slide

1113
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,140
we from a forensic perspective we store

1114
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,880
the raw messages

1115
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,859
and that's a concept that was new to

1116
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,060
this world

1117
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,300
what they used to do was store the

1118
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,640
conclusions from the chipsets so the

1119
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,380
chipset would say I think I'm here with

1120
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,660
this level of certainty and they stored

1121
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,540
that data uh whereas my system I said

1122
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm here for the time that it doesn't

1123
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,000
work

1124
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,579
I'm here for when it's broken so we have

1125
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,099
a forensic record of every message being

1126
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,920
sent by GPS clonus Galileo and baido

1127
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,300
since late 1990. sorry since late 2019

1128
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,040
and this has been effective because more

1129
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,540
than once actually more than three times

1130
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,000
so make it four times people from the

1131
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,859
Galileo project actually came to me and

1132
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:35,960
said well

1133
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,140
do you have this data from last Tuesday

1134
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,720
and uh and which is nice so thank you

1135
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,280
also to all the volunteers that make

1136
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,599
that happen and of course then I work

1137
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,280
really hard at getting them the data and

1138
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,460
because it's

1139
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,619
okay so this is also this is a really

1140
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,359
nasty graph this is what an outage

1141
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,760
looked like on our website goldman.eu

1142
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,500
all the red people would not have

1143
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,680
coverage if they only relied on Galileo

1144
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,599
they also rely on other things but if

1145
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,400
you are a project you do not want this

1146
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,160
sort of red thing hanging over Asia and

1147
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,660
it also moves around so you can see this

1148
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,720
live on goldman.eu and the map this is

1149
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,520
from this morning what Galileo looks

1150
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,960
like all the red satellites are

1151
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,880
unhealthy or broken

1152
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,500
this is also not what you want to see

1153
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,780
and this actually does not show the

1154
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,119
things that are administratively marked

1155
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,740
as broken this only shows the things

1156
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,599
that should be working

1157
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,300
so that's your 10 billion Euro project

1158
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,839
so what do we turn that into twitch

1159
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,000
and uh you can follow this account and

1160
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,260
it will tweet out all kinds of

1161
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,119
disruptions and it's sort of a sort of

1162
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,980
reverse Espionage for me because I see

1163
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,319
who follows this account so apparently

1164
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,480
it apparently is offering some kind of

1165
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,060
worthwhile service

1166
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,760
um who do we get this data from around

1167
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,160
80 volunteers uh some of them are like

1168
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,500
living on extremely remote Islands which

1169
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,940
gives them a unique vantage point

1170
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,980
because they see satellites other people

1171
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,900
don't see and they can see jamming and

1172
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,839
other stuff who are these people

1173
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,599
um lots of radio amateurs because they

1174
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,640
like this stuff you can also give your

1175
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,500
station a handle and there are lots of

1176
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,980
ham Handles in there we also have two

1177
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,900
big space agencies that run their own

1178
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,500
copy of this software and uh and they

1179
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,900
sort of tried to hide it from me but

1180
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,660
I mean so they run their own copy so I

1181
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,040
don't see because it's all open source

1182
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,020
you can run it for yourself and two

1183
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,760
space agencies run their own copy and

1184
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,920
somehow I know

1185
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,579
um

1186
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm sort of proud of that

1187
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,780
um but that also does bring me and I'll

1188
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
skip over if if you if you like this

1189
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,500
project I actually really need help to

1190
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,900
keep this going uh it does not require a

1191
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,540
lot of help but it does require a little

1192
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,000
bit of help so where are these receivers

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,940
or all over the planet uh you can turn

1194
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,099
that into this extremely impressive

1195
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,500
graph if you've ever seen War Games you

1196
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,140
find this a very scary picture

1197
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,099
um

1198
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,780
these are the lines between The

1199
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,480
Observers and the satellites they see so

1200
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,060
that's also a lot this is the

1201
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,619
architecture you can look it up if you

1202
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,079
want it's like a really nice

1203
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,480
these are the grafana there's a grafana

1204
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,660
server you can just log into that

1205
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,980
public.golman.eu and there are lots of

1206
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,420
graphs on there already but there could

1207
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,540
be five more graphs on there and so this

1208
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,220
is how old the data is that's coming

1209
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,480
from the satellites and when you see

1210
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,060
those lines go up their updates are

1211
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,460
coming in late

1212
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,380
uh this is how an interesting one and

1213
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,940
sometimes it turns out we can invent

1214
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,720
things

1215
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,240
the space agencies have extremely

1216
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,180
powerful equipment to analyze failures

1217
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,359
but I can see that if an update changed

1218
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,819
the clock of a satellite by three

1219
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,520
nanoseconds that it was not good

1220
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,780
because if you have to make a three

1221
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,640
nanosecond change

1222
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,579
you up and this is a graph of

1223
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,220
just such changes happening and and they

1224
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,420
were like yeah what what are you

1225
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,920
measuring here don't you have your own

1226
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,000
atomic clock

1227
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,160
no I don't have my own atomic clock but

1228
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,619
I can see the differences in your

1229
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,000
predictions

1230
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,160
blah blah blah we also have data for

1231
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,680
scientists like really nice

1232
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,440
so what is the output tweet

1233
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,260
Live status the governments the grafana

1234
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,720
server an archive since 2019 late 2019

1235
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,460
we have this unified stream of all

1236
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,160
messages and I made that as a joke for

1237
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,359
some a lot of the jokes someone said it

1238
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,680
would be nice if we had the unified

1239
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,300
stream where we receive every message

1240
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,280
once and I was like sure I can make that

1241
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,500
for you I turn it on and after a few

1242
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,359
weeks I reboot my workstation and this

1243
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,540
guy says are you turned off my stream

1244
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,000
and um and since then that stream has

1245
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,900
become so popular

1246
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,579
um other stuff is it worth it does it

1247
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:48,300
help

1248
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,579
I think it really and I'll really round

1249
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,380
it off then but

1250
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,359
one of the things that helped is that

1251
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,819
previously Galileo could just fail and

1252
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,160
no one would notice which does not help

1253
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,140
those people improve

1254
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,599
because they are very good Engineers

1255
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,480
working there and they work day or night

1256
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,339
on making it work and I want I want to

1257
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,619
share one anecdote for you and then I'm

1258
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,900
already feeling unhappable emotional now

1259
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,079
that I tell it again they did a complete

1260
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,640
migration of the Galileo software during

1261
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,040
Christmas one year and they did it

1262
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,420
during Christmas because that was the

1263
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,160
time when it was quiet at the office no

1264
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,380
one was there and they told me about it

1265
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,000
they said we're wondering if you could

1266
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,160
see it happening and I was studying it

1267
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,780
and I could actually see that they made

1268
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,660
the change so it's like 2 30 a.m because

1269
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,700
there was one message that arrived a

1270
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,319
little bit earlier than normal

1271
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,059
and I told these people I said well it's

1272
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,339
amazing work you did because that you

1273
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,500
can do migration so smoothly

1274
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,020
that only with forensic detail can I

1275
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,640
tell that it actually happens and that

1276
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,200
you did that middle in the nights during

1277
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,400
Christmas

1278
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,380
and then these people they said at the

1279
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,079
office no one thanked us

1280
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,599
and because no one there cared in any

1281
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,240
way they're like just I don't know fill

1282
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,980
out the reports tell people to satellite

1283
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,140
is marginal

1284
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,760
and uh so if if there's one thing I

1285
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,960
achieved those people they were like

1286
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,460
well at least someone cares if we do our

1287
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,880
job well

1288
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,660
I think we're gonna round it off here

1289
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,520
there's so much more I have to tell you

1290
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,400
there's this small book it's 1300 Pages

1291
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,460
it costs like 200 Euros if you earned

1292
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,140
if you went for it you can find the PDF

1293
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,240
everything is in here the big book on

1294
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,780
gnss this is the bit book on gnsf to

1295
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,099
round it off if you want to do some

1296
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,260
stuff and if you are a student so not if

1297
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,059
not for people with companies and stuff

1298
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:43,500
but there are two of them if you have

1299
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,300
this you can plug them in and one

1300
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,819
strongly layout and with that I'd like

1301
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,700
to round off the presentation

1302
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,370
[Applause]

1303
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,520
what more can I say but thank you so

1304
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,859
much have you ever been on Geo hipster

1305
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,740
podcast yet not that not that I remember

1306
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,740
but then I'm I'm I will try to get you

1307
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,660
on Geo hipster podcast and you'll get

1308
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,460
the T-shirt as well that would be great

1309
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,319
thank you Bertie bear

1310
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,579
