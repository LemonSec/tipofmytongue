00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
a french citizen

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,119
computer science engineer with 15 years

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,000
of experience as a web artisan and also

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a lot of experience as um

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
online militant

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,239
activists

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
with big

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,680
french associations

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,719
and also

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,719
maybe the one you know la quadrature

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,840
dunet

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
during five years i've been making the

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
press review of the quadrature.net and

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,199
during this time i dreamt about a tool

16
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,399
that could

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
save me 80 percent of my work clicking

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
back and forth

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
from the newspapers to the press review

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
and i did not find this tool existing

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
i complained a lot about this tool not

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,679
existing and after some years i finally

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,439
i finally had the idea to just

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
make it

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,479
that's how it

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
started

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
so it's a present join a

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
search engine

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
looks like

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
every regular search engine you put your

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,720
terms you click on the bottom and the

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,200
results are

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
it's in fact a meta search engine so

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,720
it's very

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,119
uh easy to understand you put your

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,159
request and the tool will

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
fetch results from

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
now more than 500

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
newspaper online

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
using their own internal search feature

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
for this to work

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,719
in a web

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
con in a web context

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
i needed to shape it as a web extension

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
to

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
gain more privilege and be able to fetch

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
online content from something else that

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
your own

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,959
uh

50
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,319
url

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
uh and to present it to you

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,239
um

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
on your on your on your

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,640
web browser

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
so here are some use cases

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
why you do need

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
a search engine to look into newspapers

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,800
into online newspapers

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
you can be

60
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
making a press review but you could also

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
be

62
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,239
monitoring a scientific area

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
there are

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,159
more than 10 sources of metapress among

65
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
the 500 i already spoke about

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
10 sources that are scientific

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
editors with

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,440
online

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
presence

70
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
but

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
everything you would do with google news

72
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,560
you can do with metapress because

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
mediapress is

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,040
a kind of a hack of google by the

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,519
outside and it provides comparable

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,400
results but without the servers

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,640
and without the monitoring of everyone

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
the tools is already able to

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
fetch

80
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
quite impressive quantities of results

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,239
and it takes not so longer not so long

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
to do

83
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,120
[Music]

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
and it provides more than just

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
what google news

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
is offering you because you can custom

87
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
the searches you can select in which

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,760
sources you will in which newspaper you

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,959
will search

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
you can select them by group or one by

91
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,358
one and so you know where it has been

92
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,240
searching for and where it was not

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
searched

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
while with the google news you should

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
believe that they search everywhere and

96
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,440
you can't check it

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
the tool also lets you

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
reschedule

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
something that was a good search

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
you click on the button and you decide

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,240
if the search should pop up on your web

102
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
browser every day every week when you

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
want for liquidator.net for me to

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
continue my work at the press review i

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
have just four of them when i arrive at

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
nine in the morning and just at 11 30

107
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,520
before the break and i have four in the

108
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
day i'm sure i won't miss any news any

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,720
results

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,759
so the main advantages is that you win

111
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
all the time that you should spend to

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,919
query all the newspaper one by one your

113
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,560
computer does this and it does this very

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
fast

115
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,960
there's no

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
private life threats

117
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
because you can check what the tool does

118
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
it's a free software you can check what

119
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
are the queries just looking at the

120
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
dev tool of your web browser you can see

121
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
that the tool is only querying the

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
newspapers you want

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
and

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
i present this tool presents you the

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
results without

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
loading any side content

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
no tracking no advertisement no pixel

128
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
uh hidden

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,840
uh it's like the nlnet said it helps you

130
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,479
to escape the swamps of

131
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,359
third parties

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
also

133
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
if you do twice the same search

134
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
hopefully you will obtain twice the same

135
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,880
results and in the same order

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
and unfortunately it's not the case with

137
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,319
all the other main

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
commercial tool to do this

139
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,000
they want to

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
trick the order they want to decide

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,039
what's on the first page and what's not

142
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,840
they want to put some ads between

143
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
it's not the case with this tool

144
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
your phone if you run the software on

145
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
your phone will be powerful enough to

146
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
sort all the results in chronological

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,919
order

148
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
that's what computers are doing the best

149
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
it's a pun that works in french because

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
in french we don't use computer it's not

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
computing machine it's ordering machine

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
we we said ordinary

153
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
so it's a lot customizable and sure it's

154
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,000
fully decentralized uh architecture

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,639
architecture

156
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
it's your computer that works when you

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
install metapress

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,120
your computer suddenly learn how to

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
query all these newspapers

160
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,120
nothing

161
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,720
is going to metapress servers there is

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
no metaphase servers it's easy to check

163
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,639
no need to come by me to check what the

164
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
servers are doing there's no servers

165
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
you are sure to be protected

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
also it means that there won't be easy

167
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
sensor

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,039
censorship on the tool it's globally

169
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
impossible to censor

170
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,599
because you you can block one newspaper

171
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
in one country but you won't block all

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,759
the

173
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
um

174
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
it also means that if

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,879
tomorrow

176
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,400
all

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
even if now all of you are trying to

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
download the thing and install it

179
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
i won't sleep bad because

180
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
it's your computer that works and my

181
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,319
servers won't be

182
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
on the knees because four million people

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,240
start to use it from one day to another

184
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
this decentralized architecture means

185
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
that

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
the more people use it the more

187
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,440
computers are running it

188
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
and it needs no new

189
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,559
equipment on the network

190
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,279
i i don't need to put more servers and

191
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
more and more servers and to put my data

192
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
centers on the arctic polar circle

193
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
like google

194
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
there's no servers it's existing

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
machines that just learn to do new

196
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
things

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
so how to get it

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
it's a web extension for firefox so just

199
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
head on to addons.mozilla.org

200
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,080
and click the add to firefox button this

201
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,390
one my favorite

202
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,880
[Music]

203
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,760
it will ask you two questions it will

204
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
wait for a few seconds

205
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,519
and then it will ask you if you really

206
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,160
want to install it just click yes and

207
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,320
then after very important you will it

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,279
will ask you if you

209
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
want to run it in

210
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
private mode

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,839
my first

212
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
move would be

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
i don't know what it is i click no and i

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
will see later but unfortunately if you

215
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,399
take the problem from another side

216
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
you're just

217
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
going through the preferences of firefox

218
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
and you see

219
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
always use private mode

220
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,240
why not i want to to have some private

221
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
life so i click on this button and it

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
ends up with

223
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
you installing something that won't show

224
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
up because you clicked not in

225
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
should i you allow it to run in

226
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
private mode that's

227
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
that's the the only thing that can go

228
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,240
wrong and people say i installed it and

229
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
nothing happened bad news but not it's

230
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
not exactly my fault

231
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
you should see a new icon in your

232
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
toolbar

233
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
with a nice

234
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
butterfly net catching

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
falling stars

236
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,839
it's

237
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,839
the news in the newspaper the falling

238
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,959
stars

239
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
and meta presses the flyknit

240
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
it works also very good in

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
inter browser

242
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
if you don't have this icon

243
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,360
either you did not allow it in private

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,959
mode or it's

245
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
behind the the small sandwich things

246
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
like burger icon

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
but the icon is somewhere i just click

248
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,959
on the icon and it will open the press

249
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,079
the certain gender scene

250
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
to finish some limits

251
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,360
um

252
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
it's it's not the cyber bullet that will

253
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,720
do everything

254
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
i try hard but

255
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
i can only

256
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
add sources to the tool

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,320
if the sources provide a meaningful date

258
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
on each results

259
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,279
it means two things a newspaper that

260
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,800
would

261
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,519
use a search engine that not that is not

262
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
printing the date of an article in

263
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
the results the page of the results of

264
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
the search engine

265
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
i could not integrate this

266
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
because i don't have the dates and i can

267
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,279
i cannot search

268
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,079
it also means that an online agenda for

269
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,360
instance a militant agenda that say

270
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
there will be protests there and over

271
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
there and

272
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
[Music]

273
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,560
this like

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
mobilizing the tool from framasoft can

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
be used and can be integrated and

276
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
queried

277
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
with this tool because the results will

278
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
be sorted by chronological order it

279
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
works

280
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
so you can query with this tool the 30

281
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,880
instances of the demosphere.org

282
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
online militant agenda and it's the only

283
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
way on earth to do this

284
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
it's not very useful because the

285
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,839
different instances are for different

286
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,240
areas but still if you want to search

287
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
something it's possible

288
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
i need a date on the results

289
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,360
i only can search

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
through through known

291
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,519
sources

292
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,959
currently there are

293
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,720
538 sources that you can query with the

294
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,440
tool only this one can be queried

295
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,000
because it requires to produce a set of

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
this

297
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
some description of the two of the

298
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,600
source

299
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
for

300
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
metapress to know how to fetch the

301
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,800
results from it so that's a limitation

302
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,839
we will need

303
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,800
more

304
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
volunteers to help us to map the world

305
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
to discover all the newspapers of the

306
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
world because it's the aim

307
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,399
currently there are newspapers from 50

308
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,160
countries 59 languages because

309
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
i had first for the newspaper of records

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
found in the corresponding wikipedia

311
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,240
page

312
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,079
and then i am doing french things

313
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
because i am french people but for

314
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,120
instance the egyptian newspapers i'm

315
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,920
sure there are some great of them but i

316
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
can't just understand what i see on the

317
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
on the main page

318
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,399
so

319
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
we need to instruct metapress

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
about new new sources

321
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
i also currently can't

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,220
fetch old archives

323
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,720
[Music]

324
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
scientists for instance they would like

325
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,320
to be able to deep dive into a subject

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
and to fetch all the results and for the

327
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
moment the tool is only capable of

328
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
fetching the results of the first page

329
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
of the of the search engine

330
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,639
and

331
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,440
and maybe maybe one day

332
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
the tool will improve but it's not

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
planned yet

334
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
uh it's a meta search engine so the

335
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
search

336
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
are taking quite some time in fact you

337
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,519
see the first result coming in the first

338
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,000
millis ground so you don't see that it's

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
long but to comply the

340
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
completely the search will take about 20

341
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
seconds

342
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
it's still not

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
long enough to print your keyboard in

344
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,240
your face like new in matrix

345
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
it's not a website it should have been

346
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
should have been better

347
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
if it has been a website but i need the

348
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
special privilege

349
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,839
and there's no email notification

350
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,639
but you have in-browser notifications

351
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,839
do you have any questions

352
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,479
yes i can move

353
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,279
yeah so for people with questions there

354
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,240
are microphones along the

355
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
lines so simon can stay up here thank

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
you for the beautiful talk simon

357
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
and if anyone has questions uh the

358
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
microphones in the middle are available

359
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
for questions and then simon can stay up

360
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,800
here and answer that very brief one

361
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
there are uh journals with

362
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,079
behind the paywall like new york times

363
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
how do you get in

364
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,759
do i get through the paywalls no

365
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,440
i am not giving you access to the

366
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
content of the article i am just giving

367
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,839
you access to the knowledge of the

368
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
existence of the article

369
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
there exist tools to go through paywalls

370
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,600
but my aim is to

371
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
reinforce the freedom of press my aim is

372
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
to get the journalists

373
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,240
living

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
and

375
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
they are i don't want to circumvent

376
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
their business models behind the

377
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,079
paywalls is not with the web anymore but

378
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,360
you know it exists and you

379
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,920
you might just reach the guy um and ask

380
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,880
for the content or something

381
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
that's a great question

382
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,079
and a great answer

383
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,240
the next one

384
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
hi

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
my question is do you have a lot of

386
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
problems with the sources changing the

387
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
way they send you data back

388
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
that's a great question and it's sure a

389
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,319
weakness of my model

390
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
the short answer is no it moves slowly

391
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
from time to time one newspaper is

392
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,680
changing his uh his appearance but they

393
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
might just change the css and not the

394
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
structure and that would be great for me

395
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
it happens but it's not a threat for the

396
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,160
project

397
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
another answer is that a lot of

398
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,559
newspapers are providing their results

399
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,640
on the rss format

400
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
you can query it and

401
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
register for the rss field a lot of

402
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,240
newspapers it's not something good from

403
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
them because they thought about us it's

404
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
just because by default in wordpress you

405
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,559
get the feature

406
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
and hundreds and hundreds are using

407
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
wordpress by default with this feature

408
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
even if they are not

409
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,440
displaying it i check will it pop up how

410
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
it gets and hop next

411
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,679

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,600
i will be fast and not

438
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
use the

439
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
i don't have slides because i was invite

440
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,480
yesterday to to do this and i can do it

441
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,280
from

442
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
is it

443
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
can you hear the okay

444
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,480
the the title is the liebig law method

445
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,200
to build networks and you will say the

446
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
libya method whatever is dead

447
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,039
i will explain

448
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
well first the problem

449
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
we are going to solve together i hope

450
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
is

451
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,799
caused by

452
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,039
massive interconnection of everything we

453
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
have built in the world

454
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
there is appearing a lot of complexity

455
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
everything is interrelated it's it's our

456
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,440
fault also because we have connected

457
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
all these things but so if there is a

458
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
single issue

459
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
a crisis a lot of other fields

460
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
are involved and should be

461
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
involved too

462
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,440
second thing is it most of these

463
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,200
crises like energy climate migration etc

464
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,240
etc

465
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,520
are a worldwide issue

466
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
i i have big uh

467
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
respect for

468
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
the

469
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
people of

470
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,799
some

471
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,080
groups who

472
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
agitate against

473
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,760
big companies

474
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
spoiling our

475
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,760
nature but

476
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,120
the the your addiction is still national

477
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,320
and that's

478
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
silly because it is it should be a

479
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
planetary issue

480
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
and we have to approach it in a

481
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
planetary way

482
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
now since hackers know what they're

483
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,559
talking about learn very fast together

484
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
and get things working yeah it's very

485
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,720
positive

486
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
usually

487
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
they can make they they know what you're

488
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
talking about

489
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,960
they

490
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,720
can if they've combined their efforts

491
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
can repair and

492
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,240
improve things

493
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
so after the apocalypse which is now

494
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,280
yeah

495
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,679
and if you look at the meaning of

496
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,159
apocalypse means revelation it's not

497
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,840
only a disaster

498
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
it is there are revelations coming i

499
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,159
hope i give you one today

500
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,200
is

501
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
we have to

502
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
take action we have to do certain things

503
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,960
and how do we do that with the liber law

504
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
method

505
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,960
mr justice lib von liebeck was a german

506
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
chemical man

507
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,520
in 1850 i think

508
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,679
everybody in the world was asking how

509
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,159
can we improve crop yield

510
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,559
because there are famines

511
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,200
and some people said more sunlight more

512
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
water more fertilizers more

513
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,679
working at the soil

514
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,679
and he said yes it's

515
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,400
all of them are right

516
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
but there's always one factor which

517
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,120
inhibits everything

518
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
it's like if you are in a congestion in

519
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
the road

520
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,760
the first car in the in the congestion

521
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,840
defines the speed of the

522
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,559
congestion so politicians shouldn't make

523
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
all kinds of

524
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
fantastic measures

525
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,679
which work the other way around in

526
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
sometimes the opposite results

527
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
from complex systems

528
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
they should go from one bottleneck to

529
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
the other

530
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,440
and take away bottlenecks

531
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,520
take away obstructions

532
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
that's what we do in networks something

533
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,840
is always stopping the traffic

534
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,559
and we have to find those spots where it

535
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,039
is congested

536
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,559
do something about it or bypass it

537
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,400
or tunnel it

538
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,280
a lot of talks you will hear this week

539
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
or these days

540
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,440
are about such measures to

541
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
zoom into

542
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,000
obstructions

543
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
but there's one downside

544
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,400
if you take away one

545
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
obstruction

546
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
the obstruction will move to another

547
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
place

548
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
the the the car which is was

549
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,000
keeping the the flow

550
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,919
from moving if you take that if they can

551
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
go faster there's another car which

552
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,720
takes over the silly role of

553
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,280
looking at the traffic blah blah blah

554
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
and everybody's waiting behind them

555
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
so

556
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,480
it is

557
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
you have to continue looking at

558
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
obstructions where they occur

559
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,919
zoom in and together with a lot of

560
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
hackers

561
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,640
help it

562
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
flow again help it to move

563
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
and that's a very positive

564
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,840
activity

565
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
with that we can construct worldwide

566
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
collective intelligence

567
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
with decentral authority to act

568
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,559
so it is no longer a central

569
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
complex system with one government or

570
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
one

571
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
group of managers who control everything

572
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,320
now we see these people having enormous

573
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
attacks of control horlicks they want to

574
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
have everything under control which is

575
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
fiction

576
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
so

577
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,360
you have permission to help build the

578
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
global brain

579
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
from such a construction with a lot of

580
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
people who work together to

581
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,039
get things moving

582
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,520
and then we will have to get

583
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,240
more than 10 to the power 10 it's 10

584
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
billion

585
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,559
connected people on this planet

586
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,159
which form a global brain and our planet

587
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,480
will wake up

588
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840
its gaia

589
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,279
is going to move and it's about now it

590
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,480
10 billion

591
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
people

592
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
bacteria already have

593
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,679
more than

594
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,159
a trillion bacteria

595
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,120
they also exhibit this collective

596
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
intelligence so

597
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
our brains contain brain cells which is

598
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
much more than

599
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,559
than 10 billion

600
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,760
so

601
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,960
the puzzle how we can get conscious

602
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,840
is at a certain threshold of that number

603
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,000
of connected things

604
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
so let's help

605
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
to connect the world and the people on

606
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,360
this planet

607
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,080
and

608
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
just disregard what managers and

609
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
governments say

610
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,850
thank you

611
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,679
[Applause]

612
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
well thank you for that beautiful talk

613
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
i'd never heard of that before

614
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
if there are any questions we have

615
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
mike's in the

616
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,679
lane in the middle so if you have a

617
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,919
question just walk up to there

618
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,520
and then i think young can answer it

619
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,279
also the next speaker can already stand

620
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,080
up and go attach their laptop or

621
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
anything

622
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,559
i write about these things in my blog

623
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,120
which is called the connectivist at

624
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
wordpress.com

625
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,760
so please read my blog

626
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
and then you get it explained in length

627
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
thank you please post your question sir

628
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
okay thank you thank you for your talk

629
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,600
i've got a question regarding how

630
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
complex systems actually work

631
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,679
given that

632
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,840
these kinds of systems do require

633
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,919
uh information exchange be between

634
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,520
agents uh

635
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,360
your proposal is the following that

636
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,799
every agent

637
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,720
at some point will gain the whole

638
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
knowledge about the system otherwise we

639
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
won't be able to control the whole

640
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,679
system do you believe it's not a

641
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,039
dystopian vision then

642
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
well the

643
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,720
the point is that you can build

644
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,279
collective intelligence

645
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,600
for instance in our brain

646
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
it is a miracle that we can see very

647
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,840
clear pictures

648
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
because

649
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
the lenses are not in our eyes the

650
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,279
watery balls the lenses are in our brain

651
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,039
it's processed

652
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,710
it's con

653
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,760
[Music]

654
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
well you you can store certain things in

655
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,080
if you make transforms of it and and

656
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,159
you can also do correlations and

657
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,279
matching

658
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,080
so we are looking very carefully at how

659
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,399
brains are concerned we don't know very

660
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,840
much about it

661
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,159
people have been either looking at those

662
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
conservation have and having

663
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
its

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,240
image processing its

665
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,559
senses combined

666
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,080
combine information from various sources

667
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
which has to be uh

668
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
in a

669
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,120
in a group and there are all kinds of

670
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,200
dangers

671
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,000
there also fascists can organize

672
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
themselves in that way

673
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
and we have already seen

674
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,640
some experience

675
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,000
examples of

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,320
being very well organized right-wing

677
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,440
people

678
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
for instance

679
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,559
but they usually

680
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,000
have

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,799
people who are very

682
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,760
loyal to the leader

683
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,520
and are not selected for their abilities

684
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
while we as hackers

685
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
select people on their abilities on

686
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
their

687
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,039
if they are competent

688
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,760
in all these

689
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,919
political parties there are

690
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,360
very incompetent people at the top

691
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,120
and that is not a very durable solution

692
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,760
even presidents who have been

693
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,279
incompetent

694
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,880
and maybe

695
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,840
the the financial rich people have

696
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,320
controlled that but

697
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
now again the tories in england have

698
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,399
selected

699
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,640
a lady who is really

700
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,159
has a peanut for brains i mean

701
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,799
sorry that i'm a bit rude but i'm from

702
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,080
the netherlands

703
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,039
and we we are not polite

704
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,760
sorry i will not add more to this this

705
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,720
disastrous discussion but

706
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
we have to

707
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,039
work together with people who are really

708
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,520
competent who really know how computers

709
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
work who really can network

710
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
and connect to each other and work

711
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,679
together to build this global brain

712
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,520
well i think that's a great message to

713
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640
end it with

714
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,520
could we get another applause

715
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,760
yeah so um the next person i'm going to

716
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,679
introduce is max and he is going to give

717
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,480
a very interesting talk on a topic i

718
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,399
cannot explain the title of because i

719
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
physically can't pronounce the words but

720
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,159
i'm sure he can

721
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,679
so um

722
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,159
before i after i repeat drink your water

723
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
and we're trying to do something about

724
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,279

725
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360

somehow

730
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,840
it's going away in a second i think

731
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,169
[Music]

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,080
elnett foundation so this year we

celebrate 40 years of trying to save the

780
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
internet uh so we first introduced it in

781
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,480
europe back in the day

782
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,799
actually is a bit of a up and so we

783
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,080
want to fix it

784
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,840
while we're still alive

785
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,480
and so uh one of the things that we do

786
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
we're when on be a public benefit

787
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,000
organization so we give money to people

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
that develop open source software

789
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,360
uh and these people actually uh so so

790
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,519
first of all maybe you are one of such

791
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,960
persons

792
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,039
august 1st you can again ask us for

793
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,480
money if you work in an open source

794
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
project just like simon

795
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,640
who presented earlier is one of our

796
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,399
projects but there are actually quite a

797
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,039
few of them over here at

798
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,000
mch

799
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
to choose a better life than working for

800
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,559
a corporate overlord work on free open

801
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,480
source free and open source software as

802
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
much as you like to

803
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,399
code your heart out and get paid for it

804
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,840
basically that's a formula

805
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,679
um but of course when people do a

806
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
project they start making stickers and

807
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
you've you've seen

808
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
uh many of the stickers uh

809
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
in uh alive there's there's whole tables

810
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,239
of stickers

811
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,520
and uh at a certain point in time your

812
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,839
laptop fills up and this is this is

813
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,280
ordered right relatively neatly

814
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
but

815
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,879
this is as much as it can take

816
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,119
now a couple of years ago smart people

817
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,040
came up with an idea why don't we

818
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,599
standardize the stickers

819
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,800
so

820
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
i present you hexagon stickers

821
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,320
and

822
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,399
just just just to make sure that we're

823
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,199
not bullshitting we brought about

824
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,199
50 or 60 different designs of heck

825
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,399
stickers

826
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,760
to the conference you can get them at

827
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
the dutch hacker hackerspaces

828
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,280
space

829
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
and you can start your instant

830
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,800
collection and the cool thing about this

831
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
is you can actually if a project becomes

832
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
uncool they go close source

833
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,680
they have nazis in their team or they

834
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
don't have nazis in your team whatever

835
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,119
your thing is you can actually rip and

836
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
replace it

837
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,520
and

838
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
add cool new things that you want which

839
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
you couldn't possibly do with these

840
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,440
15 layers of stickers that keep getting

841
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
your laptop heavier so

842
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,320
the mission in short is if you're a

843
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,520

yeah that's basically it

861
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
are we there yet

862
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,240
okay

863
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
okay yes well uh uh

864
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
the the interesting thing about oh no

865
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,800
well let's not do that you can talk to

866
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,720
me the dutch hacker spaces village

867
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
there's like a big tent there and you

868
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
can get unlimited supplies of of

869
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,359
stickers uh uh and get your instant like

870
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,640
take them for your kids take them for

871
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,720
your friends make better and prettier

872
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,720
laptops

873
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,079
that was amazing the next person up with

874
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,280
check

875
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,720
with everything working again is max

876
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,440
right and he is going to talk about

877
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,480
fuzzing of cryptographic protocols so a

878
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,710
big applause for him

879
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,320
[Applause]

880
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
i will be talking about fuzzing off

881
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,960
cryptographic protocols today

882
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,240
um so i'm max

883
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,200
this project originally started

884
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,839
in france actually

885
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,800
at inria lauria in north sea

886
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,240
so this was kind of my topic for my

887
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,320
master thesis

888
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
and right now i'm continuing this

889
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,599
project at trail of bits which is an

890
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,800
awesome security company

891
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
so

892
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
what's the deal actually so

893
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,599
in our modern world we have

894
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,920
we already had several security issues

895
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,560
in our world wide web

896
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
the security standards are usually

897
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,560
um

898
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,480
defined in what we call rfcs so there

899
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,520
are a lot of specifications out there

900
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,400
um

901
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,280
so

902
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,320
for example there's rc

903
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,480
5246 so there already have been a lot of

904
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
proposals before that and also after

905
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
that

906
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
that happens to be the specification for

907
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,839
tls

908
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,359
which is

909
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,359
basically the protocol which

910
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,720
makes our internet secure

911
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,119
but just having a specification is not

912
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,480
enough

913
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
you need to have an implementation

914
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
something you run something which runs

915
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,839
on your phone on your on your

916
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,760
laptop and this process

917
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,200
is quite error prone so by going from

918
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,359
specification to an implementation

919
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,280
developers make mistakes and they will

920
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,119
continue to make mistakes

921
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,560
unless we

922
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,440
let machines do the implementation i

923
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
think

924
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,359
um

925
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,920
so there have been already quite a few

926
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,960
security vulnerabilities which

927
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,079
occurred

928
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,200
during this path

929
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
um so what actually is fuzzing fuzzing

930
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,480
is a method for testing implementations

931
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
so basically what you're doing is you're

932
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,440
feeding just random data to

933
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,040
programs

934
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
and see how they react

935
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
see if they are crashing

936
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,040
see if they reach invalid states

937
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,119
so this is called black box passing if

938
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,480
you if you're just doing random inputs

939
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
if you're making it a little bit more

940
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
intelligent then you let your

941
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
father learn

942
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,960
to generate intelligent inputs by using

943
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
some feedback from the implementation

944
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,680
you're testing

945
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
so this is very nice for testing simple

946
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
tools like

947
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
just a linux command line tools for

948
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,520
example

949
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,760
um but it gets very difficult when when

950
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,079
fuzzing or testing cryptographic

951
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,040
protocols because protocols they don't

952
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,359
just expect a single input they expect a

953
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,599
sequence of messages

954
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,720
so it's not just plain binary data which

955
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,400
they expect

956
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,400
so the challenges are that previous

957
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,839
cryptographic messages

958
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,160
are important for the later steps in the

959
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,440
protocol

960
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
later messages in the protocol depend on

961
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,800
earlier ones

962
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,640
and also

963
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,240
you're usually not only looking for

964
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,119
crashes but you're also looking for

965
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
whether there are any logical bugs for

966
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,920
example for example if an attacker

967
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,359
somehow managed to bypass authentication

968
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,880
or downgrade the security of the

969
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
protocol

970
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
um an example protocol i've been working

971
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,880
on is dls

972
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,800
which is quite old already the earlier

973
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,520
versions are very bad

974
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,920
and right now we are using two modern

975
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,800
ones which are both quite secure

976
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,319
even though tls 1.3 is recommended

977
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
so the big picture in the fuzzer is

978
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,480
that the fuzzer generates some input

979
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
and with this fuzzer

980
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,240
you don't

981
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,119
generate just stupid random data but you

982
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,920
generate some structured data so for

983
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,760
example here we have a clientele server

984
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,839
hello message those are two kinds of

985
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
messages which i use no protocol

986
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,119
and you're already sending structured

987
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,200
data

988
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
and for example here to open ssl and

989
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
then we are watching open ssl closely

990
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
what is it doing

991
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,880
did any security violations occur did

992
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
some attacker bypass the security of the

993
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
protocol

994
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,200
and all of this is inspired by more

995
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,760
formal protocol verification

996
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,400
i cannot say i cannot go

997
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,480
very deep into this but basically the

998
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,880
idea is to formally model what is the

999
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,760
protocol what messages exist

1000
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,400
and in this model basically the attacker

1001
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
is the network so you're covering all

1002
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,680
the man in the middle attack scenarios

1003
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
so the attacker is able to inject

1004
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,599
messages intercept messages manipulate

1005
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,040
messages so

1006
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,480
just like in real life

1007
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
conclusions are so the fuzzer is

1008
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
actually able to generate a series of

1009
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,319
messages

1010
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,960
we can concretize these symbolic

1011
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
representations these more high level

1012
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,240
representations

1013
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,040
to

1014
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,440
inputs which open ssl can understand for

1015
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
example

1016
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
um that way for example the father is

1017
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
able to decrypt messages

1018
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,920
so if you would task a fuzzer to

1019
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,560
decrypt messages this is kind of not

1020
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,760
possible with traditional fuzzing

1021
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
enterprise is also able to

1022
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,319
detect and also that way rediscover

1023
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,119
previous vulnerabilities

1024
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,920
so

1025
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,240
thanks for your time

1026
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,650
any questions

1027
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,450
[Applause]

1028
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,549
[Music]

1029
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,319
so can you can you actually so there's a

1030
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,319
tool called verifel which is a symbolic

1031
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,079
verification tool which is used being

1032
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,200
used to model tls 1.2 tls 1.3 can you

1033
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,839
actually use the these models to as

1034
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,079
input because they're formalized and and

1035
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,319
and very structured

1036
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,640
um so you mentioned pro verified yeah

1037
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,040
it's it's it's it's a tool laid on top

1038
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,839
of it to to simplify development but

1039
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,200
essentially it's proverbs so it's

1040
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,560
actually the lab which i participated in

1041
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,960
did develop proverbs or was developed

1042
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,319
there i

1043
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,560
did take a look at these models in the

1044
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,640
very beginning

1045
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
and what you kind of pointed out is like

1046
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,680
the

1047
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
the grand plan which lies ahead several

1048
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
years in the future so

1049
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,640
right now it's a lot of work

1050
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,920
to

1051
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,720
get to the point where you can execute

1052
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,640
all of those

1053
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,520
tracers phrases or messages but in the

1054
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
end we kind of want to have a fully

1055
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,839
automated tool which just

1056
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,839
takes some specification for example in

1057
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,640
pro verif and then

1058
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
does it does its magic and finds all of

1059
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,200
the vulnerabilities in it okay august

1060
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
1st just just apply for a project then

1061
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,760
if it's a multi-year project

1062
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,809
[Music]

1063
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
yeah all right then thank you very much

1064
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,680
for a very interesting talk

1065
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,319
and uh well then we come

1066
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,880
right to our next speaker

1067
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
and um yeah i actually have to take over

1068
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,280
from the herald because it was running

1069
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,720
out of time and just in case you're

1070
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,279
wondering

1071
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,070
all right

1072
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:46,579
[Applause]

1073
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
so i have no slides just some reminders

1074
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,119
of what i'm going to discuss

1075
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,119
with you so my name is peter van ijk i

1076
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,359
have a couple of jobs and they're mainly

1077
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
focused on instructing

1078
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,480
cloud security and cyber security so

1079
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,119
who viewers involved in cyber security

1080
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,760
education in one way or another

1081
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
okay cool

1082
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,480
um i need dutch people among that

1083
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,720
okay even cooler

1084
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,839
so here's the

1085
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,760
thing that i'm working on together with

1086
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,680
a couple of people and

1087
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
the purpose of this short presentation

1088
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,480
is to see how we can work together to

1089
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,119
create an even better situation

1090
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,040
now i don't think that i need to explain

1091
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,520
to this audience the importance of cyber

1092
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,359
security education there's a growing

1093
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,200
demand growing workforce and if you have

1094
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,520
any data that's to the contrary i

1095
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,760
definitely want to know

1096
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,720
i am

1097
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,560
one of my jobs is working as a hospital

1098
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,960
center at a hoax hall utrecht and i'm

1099
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,040
responsible for the cybersecurity and

1100
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,359
cloud education there

1101
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,319
now

1102
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,400
what we find is that

1103
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
in a formal education program um even in

1104
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
a formal education program

1105
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,520
gamified learning

1106
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,400
works really well and many of you know

1107
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
that as a capture of the flag

1108
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,240
and

1109
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,760
what we are

1110
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,960
starting to do

1111
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
together with a couple of household in

1112
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,760
the netherlands is to build a

1113
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,119
common platform to run that on

1114
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,599
the the challenge is that an individual

1115
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,040
school

1116
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,720
does doesn't have the resources to do

1117
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,440
that either to run the platform or to

1118
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
generate enough learning content for

1119
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,400
that

1120
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,160
so we're working on what we call the

1121
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,640
joint cyber range doranelle and you can

1122
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
actually look it up it's live

1123
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,000
as a bit of a pun to the joint strike

1124
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,520
fighter of course

1125
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
and uh

1126
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,480
the

1127
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,880
it's it's in development we're actually

1128
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,280
uh working with surf and a couple of

1129
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
other interested

1130
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,680
collaborators to to work on that

1131
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,000
uh what i wanted to point out and i have

1132
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,599
a few notes here

1133
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,359
i think i don't really need to explain

1134
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,880
to you how that is going to work um

1135
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,040
because you know who who

1136
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,440
who works for ctf you know who's who has

1137
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,720
ctf experience right um who basically

1138
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,079
knows what a capture the flag

1139
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,560
competition is i i guess most of you

1140
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,160
yeah i see most of hans

1141
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,040
okay

1142
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,240
now

1143
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,640
we find it surprisingly hard to run that

1144
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,000
ourselves uh or to to to run that in in

1145
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
a school environment i mean you can have

1146
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,000
commercial or

1147
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,400
non-profit solutions for that but they

1148
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,079
don't really interface with

1149
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
student systems um they they don't allow

1150
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,280
for proper curation of the of the

1151
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,920
content from the perspective of teachers

1152
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,760
and and universities

1153
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,559
so uh that's what we're working on

1154
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,079
uh and we're

1155
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,480
not rebuilding everything ourselves um

1156
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,079
our current prototype is actually based

1157
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,400
on a ctfd running in a kubernetes

1158
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,200
cluster very cool but we would willing

1159
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,319
to ditch that if there's a better

1160
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,680
solution and we're working on that as

1161
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,359
well so

1162
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,720
wrapping this up

1163
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,040
you all have a lot of talks to go to

1164
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,440
if you are just a little bit interested

1165
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,520
in

1166
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,960
moving

1167
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,280
cyber security education

1168
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,599
specifically higher education but also

1169
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,680
primary and other levels of education

1170
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,760
ahead either in the netherlands or in

1171
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,520
western europe or in europe

1172
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
then come talk to me because we can

1173
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,200
definitely work together

1174
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
if you want to contribute content that's

1175
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,960
also something that i really would be

1176
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,960
interested in in figuring this out

1177
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,400
and with that

1178
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,440
are there any questions

1179
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,000
well that's really

1180
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,920
first thank you and a big round of

1181
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,480
applause for our speaker here

1182
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,040
and yeah are there any questions for him

1183
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200
are there microphones in the middle just

1184
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,599
walk up there

1185
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,680
if not

1186
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,920
uh i don't think we actually have

1187
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,640
another speaker now
