[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,960
it's a very great event so thank you

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
first for the organizers every angel

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,119
taking up shifts and making this

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,720
possible thank you

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,279
so my name is lucas and i would like to

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
present you um sensor community and here

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
you see our mission statement so i will

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,238
start with this one

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,800
so then the community is a contributors

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
driven global sensor network that

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800
creates open environmental data so

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,360
it is really driven by individuals that

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
are passionate about nature health

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,719
environment

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,800
and they see the need that it is

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,399
important to first have a network that

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
is generating the data

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
that can be then openly made available

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
and be used in many many many different

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
ways and what

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
ways we will come later to some of these

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,320
examples

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,559
so our mission is to inspire and enrich

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
people's life by offering a platform for

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
the collective curiosity in nature that

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,640
is genuine joyful and positive

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
so um we'll switch now over to the map

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,880
actually because this is what

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
it's all about it started with just the

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
desire of local people having a

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,520
visualization of how is the situation

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
regarding air quality now

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,560
if you are in a city and there is a

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,040
newspaper article stating that the

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
official stations had reached values

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
that are crossing much above

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
such values of being compared to cities

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
like beijing and shanghai which are both

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
equally like above 20 million people

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
it makes you kind of like nervous

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
and you think okay

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
and when was this measured oh that was

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
some time ago so i already have been

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,560
impacted and i didn't know

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
and when this appears um there was like

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
in our south german

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
city stuttgart the group was forming and

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
so like how about we contact the

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
official institution and ask them about

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
the values and the data to create a map

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
like you can see now right on displayed

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,360
under

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,000
maps.sensor.com

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
just with the interest of having a live

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
visualization of the values that is

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,640
easily accessible from all devices to be

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
informed

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
sounds simple

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
it wasn't too simple to create this at

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,040
the beginning so the institutions they

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
it's kind of new for them when their

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
requests from citizen so they say like

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,599
yeah we don't give such data out and

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
then you come around the corner as the

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
citizens say like yeah there is a

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
european directive european law

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
yeah we should have it and then the

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
citizen received an email from the

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,239
institution with a pdf it's not a

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,959
machine readable format with values that

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
are like six months old

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,959
and then you have a lot of email ping

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
pong and you get until the stage that

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
you have emails in your inbox with a pdf

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
again with values that are three months

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
old

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
so that's not really good start for

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,720
creating a live visualization map

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
then the group formed and thought about

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
like okay what is out there in the world

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
what kind of sensors to access we have

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
here people from hackerspace we have

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
different groups that organize come in

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
come out we have a lot of knowledge that

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
you can gather let's this let's make

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
this a topic right so people came

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
together and we had different solutions

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
and then we found like there is a sensor

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
available

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,599
and there are several actually sensors

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
at the beginning they've been tested so

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
the connection is like you order them

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
online you make them work and hacker

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,080
style right so it's like it's giving you

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,480
the data you can store it somewhere

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
and then you have something that you can

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
create a visualization a map so that

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
that was the beginning of the idea

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
at that time there was like the movie

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
300 warriors very famous so

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,519
how about setting up the gold having 300

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
sensors for your city right so going to

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
conference with experts and asking them

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
for their opinion and their inputs and

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
the outcome was

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
um they laugh about you they say you're

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
crazy you will never make it that was a

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
nice statement

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
and their experience was that actually

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
they have been already projects funded

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
with millions of euros trying to do the

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
same and after the period of time they

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
shut down they had maximum like 13

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
stations installed if at all

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,440
so coming around the corner as a new

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
group and stating we will do 300

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
maybe sounded a little bit

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
high of a reach for them

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
but

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
the initial group

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
did what they said

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
they ran a crowdfunding campaign so the

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
initial funding was given

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
and they bought these devices installed

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
them rolled them out

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
around the city and these devices

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
measured air quality and started

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
generating data

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
and then especially what was super

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,400
important from the beginning there was

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
like the focus on privacy right so it's

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
like separating the data from the people

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
when they register

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
also having the approach that what you

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
don't ask them about you don't have to

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
even care about so it's like ask them as

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
little as only possible but still have a

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,680
connection feedback back that let's say

140
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
the center stop sending data you can

141
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,320
still contact them make them aware of it

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
after the privacy comes the openness

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
about the open data and making it

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,960
accessible right it's like that whatever

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
you measure make it available as open

146
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,720
data in an archive as historical data

147
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,919
and then also of course from the

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
beginning in hackerspace people were

149
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,639
asking like

150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,600
will you

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
make an api will you make it available

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
so of course someone stepped in said

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
like yeah that's possible absolutely so

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
there was an api

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
and then of course

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
once you have it and you received it as

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
a collective to make it visible right to

158
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
make it a map and display the values the

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,039
life values actually to the people

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
so the idea was born and it was like

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
realized quite quickly

162
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
and when you set up something like this

163
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,800
for just 300 sensors for one city then

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
you don't think a lot about

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
automatization or scalability

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
and you can allow yourself to do a lot

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
manually so that means people registered

168
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,639
per email and then riko for example was

169
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
like really copy and pasting into the

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
database because we thought like we have

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
a fixed amount right after 300 times it

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
will be done

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
but people liked it and it worked very

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,520
well so they shared this idea and the

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,000
approach with their friends and not only

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
in other cities but very quickly also in

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
other countries

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
so very soon after that we didn't had

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
like to deal with 300 but let's say with

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
over 4 000 stations that people wanted

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,919
to register and it was like in seven

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,120
countries

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
and then a great example was like the

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
strength of the community so peter from

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
the netherlands he was a former um

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
production

187
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,639
engineer at siemens so he spoke a lot

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,880
very good german he understood our

189
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
project and he translated it into dutch

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
and just played it back said like hey

191
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
guys nice project i like it i have sense

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
of myself here is a dutch translation

193
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,639
how about

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,160
adding it to your website and we thought

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
like wow what's a great idea right

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
so very quickly this was a great example

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
that other followed and through the

198
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
power of community we've been able to

199
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
focus on the tech side

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
and the community was adding like new

201
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
translations and also corrected if there

202
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
was a mistake because everything was

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
already linked on github and made

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
accessible how we set it up and how

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
everything works

206
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
so with this approach it escalated

207
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,599
further because it was just a

208
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,840
milestone with this 4 000 stations i

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,759
mentioned it because at that point we

210
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,599
sat together and thought like okay it

211
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
seems there is more need than just our

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,879
city

213
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
and we're receiving so many emails from

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
people all around the world with trying

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
to set up something

216
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,280
very similar or basically the same and

217
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,199
they asking us if they can take the

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,479
approach and run it on a local level

219
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,560
we had a lot of conversations and what

220
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
we understood is that if this should

221
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,000
work we need three layers of adoption

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
it's like basically we from the core

223
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
team in south germany stuttgart can't go

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
everywhere in the world so we can take

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,199
only about the first step and that is

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
like the language aspect right so it's

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
like we put a lot of effort into

228
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,720
thinking how we set it up the system

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,199
differently to have this translation

230
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,960
different languages in a much smoother

231
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,599
way right much easier automatic and

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
accessible and fast

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
so we started basically

234
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,320
yeah at the beginning we had the german

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,120
name for the project it was really like

236
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,760
german air quality project focus

237
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
activity

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
and then we became into this like

239
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,959
transition phase right where we saw like

240
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
that so many stations so many requests

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
out of germany in other countries and we

242
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
have to sit down and we have to rethink

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
what we are and what we do

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
so the discussion went that way that we

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
thought okay it's all about sensors

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
there is hardware involved there is

247
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
software involved

248
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
firmware is open source then we have the

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
data the open data as an outcome

250
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,839
but

251
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,680
in this discussion we realized that

252
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
actually it is all about the links with

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
other groups other projects that made us

254
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,880
um like so successful because we always

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
had like a situation where we

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
endeavored some troubles like let's say

257
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
a scale of a change from one server to

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
another having a better tool implemented

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
and we didn't had all the knowledge in

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
our little local group right so always

261
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
someone did know someone else

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
and let them know about our discussions

263
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
and then always at the right moment the

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
right person went through the door and

265
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,640
said like yeah i do that in my daily job

266
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
that's not a problem at all i will show

267
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
you how it goes right

268
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
and then they maybe like work at let's

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
say a big corporation and deal with

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
server clusters in a day job but at the

271
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
evening they supported our activities

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
with code and really good support

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
and through that

274
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
it was possible to grow in activities

275
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
and also in scope

276
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,320
so actually we decided to have in

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
renaming because the german air quality

278
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
local approach was not working for

279
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
others in other countries

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
and we did a total transition so

281
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
basically we started from scratch again

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,440
we took a blank sheet and we said okay

283
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
how about if we don't have this german

284
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
local approach but this like rather a

285
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
global first

286
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
approach for all sorts of open

287
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
environmental data right but we will

288
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,519
still start with what we are most famous

289
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
about like the air quality network and

290
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
make this as a good example the other

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
can see about the dynamic how to

292
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,839
approach a certain topic and how to

293
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,320
translate it to other topics

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
so

295
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
that is basic the result what you see in

296
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,839
front of you that's now sensor dot

297
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
community and what we see in here is a

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
collection of a network of currently

299
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
14

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
300 sensors that are measuring every two

301
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
and a half minutes

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,279
and basically these devices are as small

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,240
as my hand pawn and they are waking up

304
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
they are doing the thing

305
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
the inlet is going like taking up in air

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,959
it goes through the chamber there is a

307
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,200
little laser beam it detects the size of

308
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
the particles

309
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
and they are defined as particular

310
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,519
matter 10

311
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
and particular meta 2.5 10 is a size

312
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
that sucks in your lungs and has already

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,959
a health impact and in the 2.5

314
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
particulars they are even smaller they

315
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
go through your lungs in your blood

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
circulation and then get in touch with

317
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
more organs so you can in general take

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
away from this session at the smaller

319
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
the particles the bigger the health

320
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
impact it is and remember that it

321
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
doesn't stop with particular matter 2.5

322
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
there are even particular matter one and

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
then there are like ultra fine particles

324
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,959
right

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,760
so

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
we had to make a very complex topic more

327
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
accessible and there is one more thing

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
to mention here worth that in europe

329
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
they're still having mostly the focus on

330
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
pm10

331
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
while in the global scope of science

332
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
there is the focus already on pm 2.5

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
there are much many more um par um

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
papers written and approaches so we

335
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
thought like okay let's

336
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,760
change this approach with our network so

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
that was like all the reason we needed a

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
sensor that is very well in

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
measuring this particular 2.5 and here

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
we are so currently

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
with this network of 14 300 stations

342
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,079
they are located in around 70 countries

343
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,480
we made everything available in 24

344
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
languages which is step number one and

345
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
step number two of like adoption is

346
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
taking over by the local heroes we call

347
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,760
them the contributors right so they are

348
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,279
from all the different countries that

349
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
say croatia serbia mexico italy usa

350
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
australia all around the world and they

351
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
are just like the cultural aspect if you

352
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,720
even take one topic like air quality

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
it is differently communicated in every

354
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
country so you need a different approach

355
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
and we can't do this for our little city

356
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,959
like for the globe so this is taken up

357
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
by the local communities right that set

358
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
up regular meetups and have a situation

359
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
that they communicate this topic to the

360
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
people in their country

361
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
and then the last level of adoption is

362
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
on a local level because even inside of

363
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
one country you have different situation

364
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
different cities one city may has a

365
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
harbor like let's say barcelona or

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
venice and then big tourist ships are

367
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
coming up and they have like burning

368
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,519
heavy oils so they are generating

369
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,480
that

370
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,000
fine particles

371
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,959
other has have an airport or you have

372
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,720
like a coal plant or you have a

373
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,959
combination of several situations or

374
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
you're like stuttgart in a valley with a

375
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
lot of traffic right

376
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,360
so we had over the time of the six years

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
hundreds of such goals of local groups

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,240
saying

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
my city is the worst worse like that was

380
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,040
always the beginning and we believe them

381
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
but then we have to ask like tell us

382
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
about the situation how is it what do we

383
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,279
endeavor how can we approach it right

384
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
because we have a setup but maybe we can

385
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
do some adjustments and we show you how

386
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,279
others did it so we can learn from each

387
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,360
other and with these three approaches of

388
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
like the focus on language for

389
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,399
accessibility localization in terms of

390
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
fight the culture aspect how a topic is

391
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
perceived and communicated and then the

392
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
very local approach done also by the

393
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
very local conversations of these groups

394
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
and basically this is like what made it

395
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
possible that now we systematically

396
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
expanded so we are contacted by groups

397
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
let's say good example was 2017 in

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
bulgaria they said we have a really

399
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
issue with air quality we don't have

400
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
like that much data and we maybe do not

401
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
trust that much to the official station

402
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
that is stating their data so we need

403
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
something in place like you have in your

404
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,360
country so we had a lot of like video

405
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
conferences back and forth we discussed

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
we exchange and they rolled out a

407
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
network of around 800 station in less

408
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
than eight months right so that's quite

409
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
uh something because it took us like a

410
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
couple of years to get there so it was

411
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
really great and we see the benefit that

412
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
when we stepped in that they could start

413
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,839
at that level where we reached after a

414
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
longer period of time and they copied

415
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
all our lessons learned and just rolled

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
it out perfectly

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
and then we became even better and

418
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,399
better in rolling it out so we've been

419
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
contacted by communities in belgium

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
netherlands poland and we did the same

421
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
thing right so we had the ramp up from

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
zero to 800. and then if you have such a

423
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,639
network you have a lot of data points

424
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
you have a lot of dots on the map where

425
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
you can look around

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
and pinpoint and say for example that's

427
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,040
my city

428
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
by the way what makes my life very easy

429
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
whenever i

430
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,600
present this i just take a laptop or a

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,279
tablet give it into the hands of the

432
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
people and i never have to ask where

433
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
they from because they immediately zoom

434
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
in their city in their street they

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
always want to know oh is there zen

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
zoning here is there something measured

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,399
how is the situation just now right so

438
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,759
that's really really great that the

439
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
interest of the people is always given

440
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
even if you meet them at international

441
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
conferences

442
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
and you can see here for example let's

443
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,000
take about the example of the

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
netherlands we have a very strong like

445
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
uh community here several communities

446
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
and so far we have 1 800 local censors

447
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
right

448
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
run by the citizen

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,839
so what do they do when they discover us

450
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,480
first you can go to

451
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,120
maps.censor.community where you have the

452
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,959
live visualization

453
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,639
and here you have the values that are

454
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,959
measured now and the station are waking

455
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,560
up every two and a half minutes making a

456
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
new measurement sending it to our

457
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
servers and we do

458
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,399
put it into the archive we make it

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,480
available through the api and we

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
visualize it on this map and this map

461
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
has a little bit more functionality we

462
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,880
see on the bottom left the color grade

463
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,279
that is linked with the values

464
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,959
and as they are like different

465
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,839
definitions from different institutions

466
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
we had made them we made them available

467
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
so for example you have here also the

468
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,839
values for pm10 and pm 2.5 in the mean

469
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,760
of five minutes

470
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,640
and for example i will display you the

471
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,119
approach of the u which is like here

472
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,760
visible so you see the color grading is

473
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
different right but basically the values

474
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,359
are the same

475
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
so that is very important because if you

476
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
consume something like this you get used

477
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
to it right so it's like we made ever

478
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
available all that we are aware of and

479
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
that is standardized but on the other

480
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
side

481
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
people have to understand that for

482
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,919
example this visualization

483
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,679
has a different understanding makes

484
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
something different for you when you see

485
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,840
like this right and for my personal use

486
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
for example prior to the pandemic when

487
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
you've been like able to travel much

488
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
more all over europe

489
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
i basically open this map similarly like

490
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
if i use the weather app right so i

491
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
check how is the weather how is the

492
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
temperature and also like how is the air

493
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
quality because i'm in a new city there

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
are other people having a sensor

495
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
measuring and i'm checking like is the

496
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
situation now good enough that i can go

497
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
and out and running should i go in this

498
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
park or in that park and because this

499
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
situation can also differ from district

500
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
to district

501
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
this map is refreshing itself every two

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
and a half minutes so the point is that

503
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
we have a lot of schools that have

504
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,640
visible like uh displays or monitors and

505
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
they just put in a connection device

506
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,039
that can access the internet they open

507
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
up this map and then it is like

508
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,520
visualized and they also focus you can

509
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
zoom in into your city

510
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
so let's say for example

511
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
amsterdam we will look and have a look

512
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
in there

513
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
so you select the city and it zooms you

514
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,360
in there you see where the locations are

515
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,120
and then you have the color grading

516
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,039
telling you the current situation you

517
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
can also click on one of the tiles and

518
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
then the list appears with the amount of

519
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
sensors and the sensor ids if you click

520
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,280
on the sensor id

521
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
it's like taking out the data from the

522
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
cache from the archive and is creating

523
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,960
this visualization with grafana for the

524
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,200
last 24 hours so you see like okay there

525
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
was a little bit of peak but it was

526
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
still like below 25 which is kind of

527
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,080
good

528
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
and here you see also like the situation

529
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,480
of the last few days up and downs

530
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
and people like to check this out very

531
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
much because there is like extreme

532
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,880
situations let's say like you have new

533
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,320
year's eve celebration with the

534
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
fireworks

535
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,679
we also hear a lot with the netherlands

536
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,280
that they have

537
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
high peaks when the germans have the

538
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
easter fires and then with the wind

539
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
situation everything comes along so for

540
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
example having the wind layer is very

541
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,799
important and that is like also possible

542
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,039
to integrate so we did it why not

543
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
so i will zoom out oh yeah i click here

544
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
on europe

545
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
and then you can also go in here and you

546
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
just add the wind layer so it takes a

547
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
little bit it has to load but you see

548
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,200
here is the flow

549
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,039
and you have this like on the european

550
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
level you can also switch on top between

551
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,840
like north america we have stations over

552
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
there so shout out to our communities

553
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
over there we have really great people

554
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
that put a lot of effort into rolling

555
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
out the first stations there and it's

556
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
getting more and more

557
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
so we have here also some in south

558
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,039
america the first ones in africa

559
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,320
asia

560
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
and here like we have a really great

561
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,120
community in melbourne that many i see

562
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,039
where they went with the data set to a

563
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,320
hacker event and made the first place of

564
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
visualizing it analyzing it and they

565
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
feel very proud what they could do and

566
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,240
accomplish with the data

567
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,039
so

568
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,880
let me now show you how you access the

569
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,640
step-by-step guides for example you go

570
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
to the website if you are interested not

571
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
only data but actually become a sensor

572
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,480
holder you go to the website and on the

573
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
top you have like this point guides and

574
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,559
here you can select air for air station

575
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
and this is what is important to make

576
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,280
available in 24 languages because

577
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,960
now you can go step by step through what

578
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
you need these are like the parts to buy

579
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,360
we don't sell them we don't have a

580
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
business model we just make on the

581
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
website recommendation please get uh in

582
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
your country it's always the first like

583
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
what kind of electric

584
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
distributor you have and get these

585
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
devices

586
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
and mostly we get the feedback that it

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
is a lot in difference of like the

588
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
the cost of shipping so in some

589
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
countries it even became more expensive

590
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,000
than the parts itself so roundabout we

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,840
can say that the material cost that the

592
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,559
contributors put into a sensor kit is

593
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,159
like around 50 euros 50 50 pounds

594
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
it defers like plus minus one euro

595
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
on

596
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,559
where you get it from each distributor

597
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,799
once you have this parts received and

598
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,080
they are lying in front of you on the

599
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
table you continue with number two step

600
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
number two which is basically we show

601
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
you how to get the little software the

602
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
firmware on the little device to make

603
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
everything work and you can do it with a

604
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,000
windows computer a mac or linux

605
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
and we also had like great support from

606
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
the polish community because they saw

607
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
like oh you make it so complicated i

608
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
have to open this i have to type in that

609
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
let's make it like a firmware flasher

610
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
right so they wrote a little program

611
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
that makes our life much easier which

612
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,919
you can download you connect the device

613
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,919
you push the button and it goes through

614
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,320
the process and it is yeah big help for

615
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
the community and for us so thank you

616
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,480
very much to the polish

617
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,679
supporters

618
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,520
it's changed our life and our approach

619
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,679
so then once you install the little

620
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,280
firmware step number three is you take

621
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
the device in front of you you

622
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
um see where it's like the first pin and

623
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
the second pin and so on and you connect

624
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
one device like to the other like these

625
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,039
are the parts on top in here you see

626
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
this is the sensor that is measuring

627
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,799
this is a little computer that makes

628
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,640
everything alive and

629
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
gets the data and sends it over to our

630
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
sensor our server

631
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,280
and this little sensor is a bme 280 that

632
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
is measuring uh relative humidity

633
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,080
temperature and pressure so we have an

634
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
indicator on a very local level wherever

635
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,480
you place the air quality sensor in what

636
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
kind of environment he is measuring

637
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
so because the sensor as it is having an

638
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
um optical approach so inside there is

639
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
like a laser beam and then when the

640
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
particles pass by and let's say the

641
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
humidity is too high it can be that the

642
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
water droplets are combining with the

643
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
dust particles and there is like a

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
mix-up right so it's like you have a

645
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
detection of wrong values but you know

646
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
it when the relative humidity is too

647
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
high and institutions like the health

648
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
and environmental ministry of

649
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
netherlands and ivm they are familiar

650
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
with this approaches and they already

651
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
published like mathematical correction

652
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,799
factors right so and they actually did a

653
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,600
very great job um they took all the data

654
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,320
set that we made available historically

655
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
they created an own data porter which is

656
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
called zaman nathan like measure

657
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,240
together and they make everything

658
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
available they also like make work of

659
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,279
our access our api so what comes in they

660
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,520
integrate immediately into their system

661
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,440
they have an own visualization and they

662
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
actually are not displaying the raw data

663
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,080
like we do on our map but they have this

664
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,640
mathematical correction factor right and

665
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,320
then also in the last step they even

666
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
communicate to the citizen hey

667
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,799
participate at sensor community whenever

668
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,640
they contact them and say like hey we

669
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
are from a small village or a city very

670
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
far away from the next station can you

671
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,080
come and measure and then they tell them

672
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,120
yeah

673
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,080
it is

674
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
big it is expensive and to our plans it

675
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
will not take place so fast but if you

676
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
want something immediately participate

677
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
in zenzo community because we integrate

678
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
that data into this data portal where we

679
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
even go so far that they do have fusion

680
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
they take the citizen generated data and

681
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
they take the official network data and

682
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
they bring it together right but like we

683
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,240
said then they do all the institutional

684
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
uh knowledge on top of it they

685
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
apply like this correction factor when

686
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
the humidity levels are too high and all

687
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,679
of these approaches are very well

688
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,919
documented right so it's like this is

689
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,200
very good and basically they are front

690
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
runners in collaboration and making this

691
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
accessible so also big shout out and big

692
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
thankful thanks to rivm and all the

693
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
divisions we had opportunity to meet

694
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,679
with them to sit down to listen about

695
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
their approach and we also could express

696
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
our plans in the future

697
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
because we very much want to go align in

698
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
how we develop and also how we have the

699
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
understanding of each other approach so

700
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
it can even integrate much better they

701
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,039
are currently doing it already as an

702
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
ministry on the national level but they

703
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
even go further there is also an

704
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
institution that is like called

705
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
joint research center that's like the

706
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,640
technical arm

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
of

708
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,440
the european commission

709
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
and there there we have fair mode which

710
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
is like

711
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
basically the form of air quality

712
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
modeling so there are a lot of experts

713
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
which like discussing about such topics

714
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,000
and especially in working group number

715
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
six

716
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,440
they have this approach about this low

717
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
cost sensors that are also installed by

718
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
citizen and how to work with the data so

719
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,000
these institutions are working all of

720
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
the same data set but each of them has a

721
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,080
different approach when they mix it with

722
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,559
satellite data with weather data

723
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,240
and then they

724
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
have different aspects on like what do

725
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
we want to analyze it and then they have

726
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
a one week technical conference where

727
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
they even present the results and the

728
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
papers

729
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
so what we want to do as sensor

730
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,000
community in the future is like that

731
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,880
feedback loop that all what the people

732
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,320
generate the data

733
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,799
we make it available to them and to the

734
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
institutions and the institutions that

735
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,520
work with it made us aware about their

736
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,600
outcomes and that we can

737
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
bring it back to the people that

738
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
generate the data to make them aware

739
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
that it's not only that you measure for

740
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,320
yourself it's not only that you measure

741
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
for others that maybe don't have a

742
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,799
sensor but you're also measuring for the

743
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,880
scientific world of these institutions

744
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
and look this is what they found out and

745
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,039
this is how you can benefit from it with

746
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,440
having that knowledge right so

747
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
by increasing um this feedback loop i

748
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
think we will strengthen the network and

749
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,799
the interest in this generation of the

750
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,000
data

751
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
and also more people will have an idea

752
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
what is possible

753
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
but with their knowledge and creativity

754
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,279
they will bring it even further and to

755
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,039
the other approaches that came out of

756
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,840
that

757
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,159
we will come in a couple of minutes

758
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
so here is a great example and this is

759
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
the working group with low cost sensors

760
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,720
it's working number six

761
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,080
you have a description they're also

762
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
publishing the results and they have

763
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
conferences you can attend so i would

764
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,720
like to make you aware about that and

765
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
thank you also very much for yours from

766
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
arifam to

767
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
yeah creates like a lot of

768
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,039
great outcomes

769
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,120
that we learned from and i will also

770
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,840
show you one example what resulted

771
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
after such a session we've been allowed

772
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,880
to attend

773
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,520
so if you go on our main website

774
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
you can scroll down and then there is

775
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
the join campaign section

776
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,039
and once we

777
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,640
accessed one of the

778
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
conversations they had between the

779
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,520
institutions we understood like oh

780
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
they actually like work with our data

781
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
the data that is generated by the sensor

782
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
community contributor is interesting

783
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,559
but

784
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
they have also sometimes like a specific

785
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,440
approach when they say we only take the

786
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
data that is very close enough to the

787
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
official stations and we ask about a

788
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,919
specific distance and they say like yeah

789
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,320
one is 250 meters and the second one is

790
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
1 000 meter so we thought very

791
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,279
interesting we didn't know about that so

792
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,600
pierre for example from our core team he

793
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
sat down and created another map this is

794
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
like sensor to rev map i will go here on

795
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,320
the green bar to make it visible on full

796
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,720
screen and what it actually displays is

797
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
that the blue dots are the official

798
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
reference stations in europe we have a

799
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
big data set and then we also

800
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,279
access one from environment protection

801
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,600
agency in the us and the red dots are

802
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,399
actually sensor community stations

803
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
and at the bottom left you can switch

804
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,120
between 250 meters and 1 000 meters and

805
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,159
now we'll show you like what the

806
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
difference is when we go into the search

807
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
bar we go for example for london

808
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,559
just out of use i'm using this example

809
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,960
so we are now in london with the map

810
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
it's loading the data

811
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,600
and you see here the blue dots are the

812
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,279
official stations

813
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,960
and the red dots are the sensor

814
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
community station so we basically create

815
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,120
like this circle

816
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
that is currently one thousand meters

817
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
and then we color grade them based on

818
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
how many sensors from our network are

819
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
close enough to be included in this

820
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
scientific work right so and to connect

821
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,399
this and make you understand why we did

822
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,320
this is because we have received

823
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
hundreds of emails from people that are

824
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
writing us we have built our third

825
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
sensor our fifth sensor our 15th sensor

826
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,039
and now me my neighbors my school my

827
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,840
workplace is covered already but can you

828
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
let me know where would it be

829
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,440
strategically of interest for the

830
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,520
collection for the collective network to

831
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,279
place the next sensor we need an

832
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,000
indicator so basically this is the map

833
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
that we will start with to make people

834
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
aware about it would be super

835
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
interesting to have this red circles for

836
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,880
example covered with a station because

837
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
that would generate data that is then

838
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,840
considered and worked with by the

839
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
institutions and actually we have the

840
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
first examples

841
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,399
where we shared the link to this new map

842
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
and people really built a sensor

843
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,559
drove there

844
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
ring the door and explained the project

845
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,279
to random people they didn't know before

846
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,760
and convince them hi can we actually put

847
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,399
this device at your house at your

848
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,279
apartment to measure and then you are i

849
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,600
will show you how to register and you

850
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
will be like that point on the map and

851
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
they really convince the first people

852
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
and they loved it and then in this local

853
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
situation they spread the word built

854
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,000
more by themselves and then also by

855
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,640
other neighbors so we increased that

856
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,880
creation of the data that was then used

857
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,399
by the institution so that was like a

858
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,159
big success story and we shared it like

859
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
also with rivm and they liked it a lot

860
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,679
they said like wow let's read the power

861
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
of the community we didn't thought about

862
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,840
it we should make more use about it

863
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,519
right so it's like how about we sit

864
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,399
together and we create like a map where

865
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,640
we are more aware about our white spots

866
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,880
because we have a bias as an institution

867
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,600
the ministry right we go maybe or in

868
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
urban areas

869
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,039
and you as a community like we expressed

870
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,720
we as a community we also have our

871
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
buyers

872
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,080
so we should not only look about like we

873
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
bring our sensors to your stations and

874
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
have a co-location and they also see

875
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
like where is our concentration so they

876
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,840
may be in their planning of where to

877
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,360
place the next station are looking after

878
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
that but also take the whole country

879
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
where are the obvious white spots that

880
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,799
none of us is existing right so in one

881
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
of these examples for example in the

882
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,200
north of netherlands uh it's around

883
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,559
groningen there was like also a

884
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,000
concession of the university of

885
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,360
groningen a local newspaper a local air

886
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,120
quality institution they put the efforts

887
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
together and they rolled out a network

888
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,919
of thing around 800 sensors in less than

889
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,240
three months and everybody said like why

890
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,480
put the sensors there anyway it's like

891
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
so strong the wind is there the air

892
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
seems always fine and now that you have

893
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
the stations you have the data they say

894
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,559
like oh actually that's very interesting

895
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,720
what we see and it's very good to have

896
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,960
the data points and look around the

897
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,360
whole country right so it stepped up

898
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,919
that the conversation led to saying we

899
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,399
have certain edge cases like the borders

900
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,320
every country and every institution all

901
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,159
around the world has the border

902
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,640
situation where they very very seldomly

903
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,679
place

904
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,440
stations right so and through this

905
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
conversation then that both been in the

906
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,080
room the different divisions of rivm and

907
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,080
us we ended up that we want to step up

908
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
about like how many sensors we're

909
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
rolling out where we place them because

910
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
currently this is just like on wherever

911
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,440
the individuals are coming from

912
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,039
and they take care about the local

913
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,320
approach but now we are more

914
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
systematically checking where would it

915
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,440
be necessary to have more data points

916
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
for the science world and to play back

917
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
the results coming out of it okay so

918
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
just to

919
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
show you also the next step when you

920
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,799
make the circles even smaller on 250

921
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,320
meters

922
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
you have to zoom in a bit

923
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,559
so you see that's even harder to cover

924
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,720
right but we even want at some point to

925
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,760
get there

926
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,559
that even such closeness is like reached

927
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,799
with where we place the sensor

928
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,720
in general you can say every single

929
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,840
sensor is very important and the sooner

930
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
the better

931
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,760
each station like the longer time frame

932
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,159
you have like for the sensor data it is

933
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,720
a big improvement and we see it like in

934
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
the results when it's presented by the

935
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
institutions

936
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
so maybe also to tell you that

937
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,799
we do this in the core like as

938
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,760
volunteers so we are

939
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
handful of people knowing each other's

940
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
emails basically and having maybe every

941
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,960
year one week of holiday less

942
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,200
but we love the project we believe in it

943
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,159
we

944
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,000
ensure that is like

945
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
saved and can keep going and is

946
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
expanding

947
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,918
but this all would not be possible at

948
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,159
all without all the hundreds of helping

949
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,719
hands all around the world so also we

950
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
want to use that occasion and if you see

951
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,679
this we thank you very very much for all

952
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,440
the efforts you do all the workshops

953
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
that you run

954
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
all the explanation that you make and um

955
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,480
yeah to support um the wider community

956
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,440
of the

957
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,280
sensor kit holders so thank you very

958
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,879
much

959
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,719
and also like for everyone who built the

960
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,399
sensor and it says and the community

961
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,079
contributor and it's generating to the

962
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,359
data

963
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,440
and now we also want to let you know

964
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,760
that maybe you are not aware but the

965
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,000
data that you generate is feeding this

966
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
map and this map is seen by tens of

967
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,639
thousands of people so we have even

968
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,960
known that for a good example is coming

969
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
back to bulgaria this map is being

970
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
integrated in a local news

971
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,599
website and then in the morning show

972
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,760
they sometimes let the people know hi we

973
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,079
have a peak we have a peak in the city

974
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,960
and we have like ins in minutes we have

975
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
uh 86 000 more people opening the map

976
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
so we we learned also like how to scale

977
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,560
up the infrastructure we have like

978
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,400
redundancy built in

979
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,119
because we also need sometimes sleep so

980
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,280
we have to ensure that this map is

981
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,760
always accessible and running

982
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,200
and

983
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,040
we also see the dependency from the

984
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,760
communities that they build on top of it

985
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,720
other

986
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,520
solutions so when the service is down

987
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,000
also for just a few minutes because of

988
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,839
whatever reason there is many things

989
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,119
that can happen

990
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,800
at the end it is like an orchestration

991
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
of 13 different virtual servers

992
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
creating this

993
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,839
making it accessible then the community

994
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,040
is immediately like letting us know and

995
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,680
we also have all the reports what else

996
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,040
they are doing with it right so there

997
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,440
are many like notification systems built

998
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
there are chat bots built

999
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
i think it was in the ukraine they

1000
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
created the chat bot for certain

1001
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
messenger and they're like 80 000 people

1002
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,599
that registered for it to get the

1003
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,920
notification even the network itself is

1004
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
very small we don't have that many

1005
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,760
zens or stairs yet

1006
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,920
and it was of course uh prior to the

1007
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,400
pandemic and prior to the war but the

1008
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
interest was they're amazing and

1009
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,359
um another thing also very important for

1010
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,079
us to mention is that we based on the

1011
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,240
conversations with the communities we

1012
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,400
see a very big potential like there's

1013
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
activities that are cross-border

1014
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,720
so we try to organize like working

1015
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,280
groups that are topic driven for example

1016
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,960
they want to set up a different type of

1017
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
sensor and then we hear the interest

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,160
from different countries different

1019
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
cities and we bring them together and

1020
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
they collaborate online like it would be

1021
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,079
in the same room like it would be their

1022
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,040
neighbors

1023
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,520
and this is like really great to observe

1024
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
when several teams are working together

1025
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
collectively exchanging improving and

1026
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,160
then we come at a certain point where

1027
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,680
they come back and say like okay we

1028
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,000
reach a level we think it is good enough

1029
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
to be now deployed and that is for

1030
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,359
example the noise sensor kit so we have

1031
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,640
a second network where we measure noise

1032
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
it recently came out of beta

1033
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
and it was also the approach that

1034
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,240
at the community event from noise

1035
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,560
communities they said like they contact

1036
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,640
us and say like hey we saw what you did

1037
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
with the air quality topic how you made

1038
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,960
it accessible and understandable we need

1039
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,720
the same approach for noise right we

1040
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,440
need to have a kit that is much lower in

1041
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,839
price point it has to be more accessible

1042
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,000
it has to be easier to create by

1043
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
themselves by the citizen

1044
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
and also it has to be communicated

1045
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,200
in your way like the archive the api the

1046
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
map

1047
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
so there was like several different

1048
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,079
approaches in parallel at the end it was

1049
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,599
like a team

1050
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
approached very fast and we have a

1051
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
version that is like not only running up

1052
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
and running and existing

1053
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,040
but

1054
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,880
coming back to rivm

1055
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,200
picked it up they checked it and they

1056
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,440
had a long-term

1057
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,119
testing going on

1058
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,200
and now when we had the opportunity to

1059
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
speak with them again they told us

1060
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,599
already that the report is very soon

1061
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,599
before it will be like published and

1062
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,359
that the results are making them very

1063
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,560
happy

1064
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,200
so they already approached a company in

1065
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
the netherlands to build 50 of them for

1066
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,160
them and then they have placed 25 each

1067
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,680
in two locations with two different

1068
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,320
approaches one is for

1069
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
traffic and the other one is given out

1070
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,359
to noise sensitive people and to make

1071
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,000
create like analysis and data and to

1072
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,079
have like these two reports that's how

1073
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,560
the institutions work for our work it is

1074
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,839
like to make such a device

1075
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,000
available and have this infrastructure

1076
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
accessible so all the different

1077
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,720
communities can run it and now let's

1078
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
switch over on the map and see how it

1079
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,200
looks so go over here

1080
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
and here it is the noise map so you see

1081
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
we have 250 live devices already from

1082
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,800
the beginning in several countries

1083
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,920
and

1084
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,480
this is like the current situation

1085
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,160
that you can click

1086
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,680
the same mechanism you click on the

1087
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,320
sensor id and then it shows you like the

1088
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
values right so currently we have the

1089
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
three values that we are receiving from

1090
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,160
the devices

1091
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,119
but we want to step up it will be like

1092
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,720
10 times more

1093
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,079
and which one we are now in the

1094
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,760
discussion with the institutions because

1095
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,599
we want to align with what is already

1096
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,640
known

1097
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,839
in the scientific world so that we

1098
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,760
generate data points that are really

1099
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
like usable for them

1100
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
and we immediately get to the point

1101
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,040
where

1102
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
these two worlds i brought together

1103
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
right so the citizen approach of rolling

1104
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
out the devices

1105
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,119
and the world of science where they have

1106
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
already the knowledge to work with

1107
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
massive data sets

1108
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,119
and topic specific

1109
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
so basically we have currently like

1110
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,040
mentioned two networks this is the air

1111
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
quality and this is like the noise which

1112
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,640
are two different

1113
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
kits and two different approaches now i

1114
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,440
will mention the last one which is no2

1115
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
diffusion tubes

1116
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,760
so you come back to the website

1117
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,119
and you go down to campaigns

1118
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,280
by the way in the last two years we had

1119
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,680
many more campaigns we closed a few

1120
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
because

1121
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,880
we are in the core like just for people

1122
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
we we can't do everything

1123
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,200
but let me tell you about the no2

1124
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,520
campaign so for example we

1125
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
been in touch with an institution that

1126
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,880
um had run a campaign with many

1127
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,960
diffusion tubes they're just like little

1128
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,040
plastic tubes that you place in the

1129
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
height of 200 meters

1130
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
close to a street but not close to an

1131
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,800
intersection that is the approach that

1132
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
you have

1133
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
and then they had three

1134
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,680
300 of these tubes left over and they

1135
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,599
didn't had contacts and we said like no

1136
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,359
problem we have people all around the

1137
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,440
world just let us know about the scope

1138
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
and they said like yeah europe is a

1139
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
group one and then we said immediately

1140
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,640
phoned around and here you see we had

1141
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
nine different cities

1142
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
we contacted them and they said like yes

1143
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,920
that sounds very interesting we want to

1144
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,000
do that can you explain us how

1145
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
so we had

1146
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,359
on conference call online we teach them

1147
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,960
about the approach they've been trained

1148
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
about how to analyze the spots in their

1149
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,960
cities where to place the sensors

1150
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,280
then they mark them on the map we played

1151
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,119
that back to the experts they made

1152
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,720
little adjustments because some of the

1153
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
tubes if you have for example for one

1154
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
city 20 of them you have to place a

1155
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,720
handful in living areas for comparison

1156
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,640
reason that's how the method works and

1157
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,800
also not too close to intersection that

1158
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
is how the method is set up

1159
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,560
so they made the adjustments of the

1160
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,440
location we played the data back to the

1161
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,200
people on the ground they said like yes

1162
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,119
understandable check check check

1163
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,680
now we packed these parcels sent them

1164
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,920
out to the nine locations in europe and

1165
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,599
the people received the parcels we had

1166
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,280
the tracking number we had the feedback

1167
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
loop from them and they've been very

1168
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
happy and then they did walk the dog

1169
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
they walked the dog around the city and

1170
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,599
at the location they had their documents

1171
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,119
and they marked like the location the

1172
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,000
exact timestamp and how it was set up

1173
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
and placed it

1174
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,400
around a pole of a lamp or a location

1175
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
they identified and then this method is

1176
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,119
that the tube is staying there for a

1177
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,000
month

1178
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,079
and after a month they do the walk the

1179
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,119
dog again they go and pick it down write

1180
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,119
it into the protocol put it in an

1181
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
envelope and send it to an institution

1182
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
that is analyzing them to our knowledge

1183
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
there are three or four in europe and

1184
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
this is also the same methods

1185
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,200
that the official institutions we have

1186
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
in each country are doing right and this

1187
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,520
is a chemical approach

1188
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
but it is like very hard proven like you

1189
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
can go and sue

1190
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,680
the city if there are like levels are

1191
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
above

1192
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
a certain limits due to

1193
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,040
however is your

1194
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,400
national regulation the point is that

1195
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,079
this approach

1196
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,240
many local groups in many different

1197
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,839
cities are doing

1198
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,400
but they stay local they always do their

1199
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
local crowdfunding campaign they have a

1200
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,079
local website and then they're running

1201
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,880
out of energy or resources to continue

1202
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,800
because they have to put all the efforts

1203
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,280
in finding out how does it work

1204
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
and 80 is

1205
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,520
of the energy goes into analyzing how to

1206
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
get it done and actually like the last

1207
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,839
20 to make it happen

1208
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,160
the point is that many are not informed

1209
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
that it is very important to not run

1210
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
this only for one month

1211
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,240
but to have enough for doing it minimum

1212
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
a whole year right so that is like

1213
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,280
changing the validity of all the

1214
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,200
approach and all the data

1215
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,359
so we thought about like how about we

1216
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,920
help them with the first part creating

1217
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
an infrastructure i can easily like

1218
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,480
visualize the data make it accessible

1219
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,319
and they don't have to run all and own

1220
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,240
website declaration and all look

1221
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,480
different and it's just a local but to

1222
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
make it visible about all these local

1223
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
approaches together and we created this

1224
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,599
map for first our campaign so this is

1225
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,520
like the nine

1226
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,200
measurements done by zen the community

1227
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,800
local campaigns

1228
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
and then this map received visibility so

1229
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,440
we've been contacted by the other

1230
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
institution that had run measurements

1231
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,480
with over 6 300 measurements and they

1232
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,560
said like hey here is the data set can

1233
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,200
you integrate it into your map because

1234
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,079
your map has many more visibility

1235
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,760
and this is like what we are working on

1236
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,160
now so this map will be very much soon

1237
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,920
released with all the measurements from

1238
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,480
this institution and now it is about us

1239
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
to spread the word and make all the

1240
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
existing local groups that run this

1241
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,520
campaign already and connect because all

1242
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,280
they do is like they send us this piece

1243
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,440
of paper from the official institution

1244
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,680
that analyzed it we contact them we

1245
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,839
approved this is like real data and then

1246
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,599
we upload it and publish it make it

1247
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,319
available there so basically to put all

1248
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,000
the local

1249
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,760
efforts from all the hundreds of little

1250
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,720
groups

1251
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,480
on a platform where they get more

1252
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,560
visibility and they can exchange about

1253
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,240
the approach and become better and

1254
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,960
better to basically coordinate our

1255
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,720
collaboration right

1256
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,800
and this is like receiving currently a

1257
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,560
very strong feedback from the

1258
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
communities they like it a lot

1259
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
and then they think that the efforts

1260
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,800
that they put in the first to roll it

1261
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,880
out at all they can put now in the

1262
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,359
continuation so we have the first

1263
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,520
communities that continued the

1264
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,560
measurements and are now in month 15 and

1265
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,800
month 18 and they are very happy about

1266
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,040
it right so and they ensure that even

1267
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
the until the end of the second year

1268
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,200
they have enough resources to exchange

1269
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,520
their the tubes and it is like a very

1270
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,680
strong data set that they can now then

1271
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,560
build on with the cases and the work

1272
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,640
so basically

1273
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,880
this is like our current situation that

1274
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,200
we have the air quality network with 14

1275
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,079
000

1276
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,119
station

1277
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,200
generated over 18.4 billion data points

1278
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,720
we have the second network with the

1279
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
noise with 250 stations that is out of

1280
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,160
beta and is now expanding and growing

1281
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
and also the ministry like ibm said this

1282
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,880
is like very good approach we want to

1283
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,200
use it we want to build on top of it

1284
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,359
and we have the proven no2 diffusion

1285
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,160
tube method that is already done by many

1286
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,640
local groups but

1287
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,720
to not stack the knowledge and the

1288
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,480
values on a local base

1289
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,040
we now giving them the offer to add

1290
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,480
their values to the map and make it

1291
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
visible for the collective for all

1292
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,200
so

1293
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,280
i want to close this presentation with

1294
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
giving you like hints in maybe you are

1295
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,839
in different uh situation different

1296
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,359
interest fields how you could like

1297
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,520
become a member of community sensor

1298
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,880
community so basically you are already

1299
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
when you're opening maps.sensor

1300
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,400
community and you are checking the

1301
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,640
values close to yourself like wherever

1302
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,599
you live

1303
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,680
and see it and treat it like something

1304
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,920
that is given it should be everywhere it

1305
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,440
should be like the weather forecast

1306
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,520
right so consume the data it is

1307
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,200
refreshed every two and a half minutes

1308
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,280
and um you will see

1309
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,720
if there are extreme values you will

1310
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,880
consider okay what can i change and then

1311
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,800
you will have to ask like all the local

1312
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,520
groups what is impacting uh the values

1313
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
where does it come from what can we do

1314
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,839
and this sparks like new conversation

1315
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,000
new approaches

1316
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,200
if you want you can also like build and

1317
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,680
operate a sensor yourself so how to do

1318
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,319
that is like you go to the main website

1319
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,319
and go to guides

1320
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,480
and follow the step-by-step

1321
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,760
approach with first receiving the parts

1322
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,960
second putting it together

1323
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
installing the firmware registering and

1324
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,880
then you are becoming a point on the map

1325
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,839
and

1326
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,000
now that we are at the hacker conference

1327
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,160
like we thank you very much because we

1328
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,680
receive so much support from the hacker

1329
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,880
community

1330
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
they go to github they check

1331
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,599
the publish like the tools and they push
