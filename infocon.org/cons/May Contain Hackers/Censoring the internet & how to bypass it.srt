[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,279
we are here and we will have a talk from

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,640
asim

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,439
who

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
came over here to tell us about all the

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
censoring that we see in some countries

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
not here maybe so much but in other

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
countries the centering of the internet

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,679
and he's showing us even in a very

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,280
practical manner

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,399
how

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,600
you

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
even if you're not a technician

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
can bypass these centerings so we will

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
even have a live demo

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,600
have fun with asim

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
hey thank you

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
thank you

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,440
[Applause]

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
hello everyone uh this is a theme and

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
probably if you live in this region you

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
wouldn't have experienced any kind of

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
censorship because i was trying to run

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
an application to test if any of the

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
websites are blocked or not and i didn't

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
find any so i'll be showing the results

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
towards the end of the presentation

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
and the talk the topic is censoring the

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
internet and how to bypass it so

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
uh uh

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,360
a lot of

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
you might think that it would be a very

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
technical one which is which is which it

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
is but uh there are a lot of small

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,000
integrity things that

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
you can

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
as a normal person who wants to bypass

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
it you can use it like if you have an

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
android device i would have some

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
settings that you can add to your device

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
so as to get a totally sensitive

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
internet or an internet that's not being

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,159
monitored by your isp so isp stands for

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
internet service provider

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
so yeah let's get started um

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
who am i uh so myself i also

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
teach about cyber security on my youtube

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,640
channel called hacking simplified

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
professionally i work as a security

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,079
engineer in a us-based startup called

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
rippling i sometimes hack government

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,318
websites and private organizations as

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
well as part of their bug bounty

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
programs

55
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
so you can scan this if you want the

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
slides and read through it but i think

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,280
you can easily see it on the screen

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
itself

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
let's skip

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
this

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
on these are some this

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
so yeah

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
so i'll start with the question as to

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,319
what happens when you type a url in your

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
browser and you press the enter button

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,599
what all goes in the back of it so if

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,280
you are a software developer you might

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,519
have experienced this question in your

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
interviews because this is one of the

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
very common questions that you get asked

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
the in the later half i will talk about

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,200
how

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
the whole process once you understand

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
the whole process you would get to know

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
where are the places where you can be

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
censored and where you can be monitored

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
because once you understand something

78
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
only then it gets easy to bypass it or

79
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
basically get over or get around it

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,959
so there are like places the traffic can

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,120
be censored those are usually two places

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
there's a dns and then there's a http

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
request i'll be talking about both of

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
these in detail

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
and after those are done we'll talk

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,080
about the bypassing of these

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
so

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,599
how many of you know like what happens

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,360
when you type let's say

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,040
mch2022.org in your browser just to show

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
fans

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
cool how many of you know what our dns

93
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
is

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
cool so how many of you use cloud flare

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
dns

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
okay that's quite

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,319
low in number

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
okay how many of you

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,959
okay how many of you know what

100
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,040
8.8.8.8 is

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,350
cool okay fine

102
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,879
[Music]

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,000
sorry

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,799
uh yeah i have that but cod nine i think

105
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
lesser number would know but yeah so

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,760
yeah

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,480
uh let's see what happens so this is an

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,918
over simplified version of it so

109
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
this is your browser and let's say you

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
go to my website at seamstream.com so

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
the very first thing that happens

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
because machines understand only numbers

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
they don't understand what a seamstress

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
dot n is

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,960
so this a seamstress.10 website gets

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
translated to a number that number is

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
the ip address ip address is the

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
internet protocol address

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,000
that number is basically the address

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
where my website is hosted

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,960
and on the right far right if you see

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
that is the server uh the web server

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
where the machine

124
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
my website is hosted so now the browser

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
has got the ip address from the dns

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
server it tries to send the request to

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,880
that

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
machine that hey please give me the

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
website that's a seamstress.net the

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
website complies and gives back the html

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,440
web page

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
this is the http flow

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
let's say an oversimplified version of

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,880
an https flow the first part remains the

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
same in the second part there's some

136
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
mathematical calculation which we call

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
as encryption

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
and that basically what it does is when

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
the html web page comes to the browser

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,360
that is encrypted so that anyone who is

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,919
in between the browser and the machine

142
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,400
that where my server my website is

143
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,639
hosted no one can see that data so

144
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,280
suppose you are using a website that has

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
payment data or you are entering your

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
let's say

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
paypal credential or your stripe

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
credentials or credit card number so

149
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
those are usually encrypted and you see

150
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
that https on the url with a green

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
padlock usually

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
so that's the http is slow

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
now let me show you the actual flow

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
so this is the actual flow you don't

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
directly talk to the dns so you don't

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
directly talk to the machine there is

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
usually an isp

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
like if you check the isp currently

159
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
where you if you're connected to mch

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
wi-fi you would see stitch internet

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
something the organization name is

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
stitch and something so that is the one

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
who is providing the whole internet

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
infrastructure to this area if i go to

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,880
my

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
country india there would be airtel geo

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
or any other mobile network providers

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
they are usually the internet service

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
provider

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
so the traffic if you can see this slow

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
the browser first requests the isp isp

172
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,960
does all that part on behalf of you

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
now this is

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
quite an apt

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,319
like this is the answer to the question

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
what happens when you enter a url into

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
the browser and press enter this is a

178
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
very detailed one i won't be talking

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
about it but it's a very good one uh

180
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
thanks to wasim chekham i found it

181
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,479
online

182
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,360
but

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
go through it because it would have the

184
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
sites it's quite interesting to know

185
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
what happens and

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
how easy you feel that you just press

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
and enter and it happens in the snap of

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
a second but this whole thing happens in

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
that snap of a second

190
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
now you might ask okay so what like i

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
got the flow i got the https flow now

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
what what more

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
so let's see which places traffic can be

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
censored now

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,039
so now if you see the isp's color has

196
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,120
been changed to red that signifies that

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
there is a danger

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,599
so

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,120
because the isp is in control of the dns

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
request that is going and it's also in

201
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
the control of which server the

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
web page from where the web page is

203
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
being fetched what is being returned all

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,039
this is

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
you are on the mercy of the isp so

206
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
basically everything is going through

207
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,879
them

208
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
so that's where like these are the two

209
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
end point the dns thing and the http

210
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
https request for http request these are

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
the two places where

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
the isp can basically come into picture

213
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,680
and try to modify or censor the data

214
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,000
that you are getting

215
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,879
okay

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
so dns level sending fake dns responses

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
and http request is the host header and

218
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
the http intercepting so i'll talk about

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
both of these so dns level is when

220
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
you're trying to get the ip address so

221
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
imagine the case where you're trying to

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
let's say

223
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
access a website that

224
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
is supposedly that should be blocked or

225
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,080
let's say

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
there's a website of a terrorist

227
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,760
organization that your country doesn't

228
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
want you to see so what they would try

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
to do is they would try to send you a

230
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
different ip address that doesn't belong

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
to the terrorist organization's website

232
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
in the same case when you have the http

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
request so in that part what happens is

234
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,839
if it's an http not it's a non-encrypted

235
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
uh traffic they can directly modify the

236
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
traffic and send you let's say a notice

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
that this website is banned or something

238
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
like that i'll show you some examples

239
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
later in the slides so how

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
html response is being modified i also

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
have a wireshark packet capture which

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,920
basically shows the flow of the tcp as

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
to how that data is being modified

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,279
don't get overall about all these terms

245
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,720
it's very simple i mean

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
tcp and all it gets

247
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
over

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
okay let's

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
i think yeah

250
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,480
so

251
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
on the dns level sensoring uh there are

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
two methods that that are usually

253
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,839
employed by these isps the first one is

254
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
they try to

255
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
once you get a

256
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
internet connection from your local isp

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
or home server you are basically um

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
giving the lease for your internet

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
connection let's say you are in u.s and

260
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
you get comcast or let's say you're in

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
india you get airtel geo any other

262
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
internet service provider so they give

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
you a router

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
and you basically get the wi-fi

265
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
connection using that

266
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
so this router has predefined dns

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
service ip embedded into that and that's

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,320
where i would come to the cloud fair dns

269
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,480
and 8.8.8.8

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
so these isps when they give you the

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,040
router and the internet connection they

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
already have their own dns server as the

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
default server where your request would

274
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,360
go

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,880
so if they have to do any kind of

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
filtering they would just

277
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
send you like an invalid response or a

278
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
fake response or a different response

279
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
instead of going through all the hassle

280
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,920
of like

281
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
encrypted like intercepting your traffic

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
and doing all that so that is the very

283
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
basic that they do they also do this

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
because sometimes um it's easier for

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,519
them or to cash it on the isp level and

286
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,880
basically

287
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
you can get all the dns responses on

288
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
their own isp so the traffic they don't

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
have to forward the internet traffic

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,240
from your device to a public dns server

291
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
for example let's say

292
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
uh you get a connection from a local isp

293
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
and

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
they are running their own dns server so

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
you request for google.com so what

296
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
happens is

297
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
where we saw the previous slide so the

298
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
google.com request goes through the isp

299
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
isp has their own dns server running it

300
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
returns the ip address of google.com and

301
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,160
then basically your machine makes a

302
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,600
connection to that

303
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
so

304
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
what happens let's say you are trying to

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
access this website which is banned

306
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,959
let's say a terrorist organization

307
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,560
website or any kind of website that your

308
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,399
country feels is not

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
to be shown to their citizens so what

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
they would

311
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
like give a notice to the isp is that

312
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
when you get a request to this change

313
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
the ip address or return the non-valid

314
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
ip address instead of

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
giving a valid ip address response so

316
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
there are two ways they do it either

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
they have one is called the sinkhole

318
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
sinkhole is basically they have their

319
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
own machine which serves uh government

320
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,680
notice that this this website is locked

321
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
so any request that goes through them

322
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
they return the ip address of that

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
machine so that is called the sinkhole

324
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,920
so all the requests go through that

325
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,959
sinkhole

326
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
the other method is they return a nx

327
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,160
domain response so nx domain is no

328
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
domains exist so the browser feels that

329
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,639
there is no domain as such

330
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,160
so

331
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
to replicate this you can just type

332
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
random characters let's say abcdefgh

333
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
whatever you want to type and then dot

334
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
com so the browser would show that nx

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
domain this domain does not exist

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
so that is what they do

337
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
the other thing that is quite

338
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
like creepy i would say the transparent

339
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,480
dn is proxing what happens in that case

340
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,200
you

341
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
so

342
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,560
that comes because the first case when

343
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
you have the default dns you can change

344
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,680
the default dns to a dns provider of

345
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,279
your choosing let's say you choose

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,000
google's dns provider or cloudflare dns

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
provider because you know that those

348
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
providers won't block these are public

349
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
dns providers so you enter their ip

350
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
address as your dns resolver so let's

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
say you add 8.8.8.8 as your dns

352
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,000
resolvers so any website that your

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
browser wants to fetch they would fetch

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,120
from google's public dns resolver that

355
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
is 8.8.8.8

356
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
coordinate

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
what happens in this case because now

358
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
isp is not control of your dns traffic

359
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
so they can't censor that they can't

360
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
monitor that so what they do is

361
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
uh

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
here comes the technical part of it so

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360
dns works on port 53 every machine has

364
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
like 65 000 ports and using these ports

365
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
your machine makes connection to the

366
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
outer world so dns or domain name system

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
that works on a particular port called

368
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,279
port number 53 that's a port number

369
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
so what these isp do they monitor

370
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
traffic on this port 53 and

371
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
well and what they do is they route all

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
the data all the traffic that is going

373
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,240
to port 53 to their own servers so even

374
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
if you set google as your dns server the

375
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,959
request doesn't go to google rather they

376
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,279
go to the dns providers and because the

377
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
whole in internet traffic is going

378
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
through them so they can easily do it

379
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
without like transparently do it and you

380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
wouldn't you wouldn't know any better of

381
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,160
it the other thing that happens

382
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,000
and sometimes because people know okay

383
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
they are transparently proxying their

384
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,639
dns

385
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,920
what isp do is if it's a blocked website

386
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
they won't

387
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,920
like proxy it like in india recently i

388
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,320
think two years back what happened was

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
uh some websites those dns was being

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,279
provided by cloudflare whereas the other

391
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
was being routed to the isps so they

392
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,160
were transparently proxying those i'll

393
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
show you a diagram that would help you

394
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,160
explain it

395
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
um yeah so this is the first one the

396
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
fake dns so let's say even if you have a

397
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
vpn tunnel connected to your

398
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
infrastructure the dns or the port 53

399
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
request because it's not going through

400
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
the vpn by default so that goes to the

401
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,160
isp and the isp changes the response to

402
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,639
that so even if you the major traffic

403
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,839
the http http traffic https traffic goes

404
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,240
through vpn it goes to the wrong ip

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
address or it goes to the wrong server

406
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,519
so you would get a different response

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
either way

408
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
it's also called a dns leak because

409
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
this helps the companies to know which

410
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,800
websites you are using even though you

411
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,199
are using a vpn so the whole purpose of

412
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,920
vpn is to provide you anonymity and like

413
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
so that no one knows what you're

414
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
actually viewing but using this dns leak

415
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
the isps know which particular website

416
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
you are browsing even though they don't

417
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,079
know what you are browsing or what you

418
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
are doing there but they know okay a

419
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
request is being made to

420
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
so and so website

421
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,519
this is a transparent dns proxy so in

422
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,639
this case even if you have a public dns

423
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
set as your proxy you would still your

424
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,000
request would still be routed to the

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
isp dns and you would get a response

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
from them

427
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
yeah so if you have a mobile phone right

428
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,240
now you can

429
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,560
go to this website dnsleaktest.com and

430
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
you can see if your dns requests are

431
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,959
getting leaked to the isp or is it going

432
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,279
through cloudflare or whichever dns you

433
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,399
have chosen

434
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
uh i think i have it up here so this is

435
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,639
the website that's how it looks

436
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,600
so

437
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
there's a standard test and there's an

438
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
extended test so

439
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,519
i hope it's visible yeah so in the

440
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
standard test they do one round of

441
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
testing where they send requests to

442
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
their own unique domains and try to find

443
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,800
whether you are trying to access that

444
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
your you are trying to access that

445
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
domains or

446
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
the isp is trying to access that and

447
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
give you the response so let me just

448
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
show you that

449
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,759
so

450
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,839
in

451
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
so you can see i have the isp set as

452
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
cloudflare so you get a responses

453
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,800
cloudflare amsterdam if it was being

454
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
blocked or if it was going through the

455
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,880
isp you would see the isp's response

456
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
isp's name here

457
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,520
this is a good website they have

458
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,919
like quite a detailed thing and how it

459
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,000
is working and you can read about it i

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
have these in the

461
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,240
or they say in the references slide

462
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
if you want to know how it works and

463
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
there's a way that you can even if

464
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,839
you're using cloud file you can still

465
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,280
modify that and

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,039
manipulate it to show that you're using

467
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
air trail dns it's i mean it's very easy

468
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
to work if you want you can

469
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
talk to me about that later we can see

470
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
how that works

471
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
um

472
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,559
now let's see how you can bypass these

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559
checks

474
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,720
so the very first thing is if you are in

475
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
the first if the isps in the first

476
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
category where they're just having the

477
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
default uh

478
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
dns server you can just choose any of

479
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
these dns's let's say cloudflare opendns

480
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,799
or quad9 so

481
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,559
you can set it in your mobile setting or

482
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,320
in your browser setting and the dns

483
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
request would go to them it is for the

484
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
first case when the isp has set a

485
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,480
default dns

486
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
server into your router

487
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,360
you can also clear your dns case so what

488
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
dns case does is let's say you are going

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
to google.com again and again so your

490
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
browser won't be sending a dns request

491
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,360
every time you go to google rather it

492
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
would save the ip address of google and

493
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
it would just continue with that but

494
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
let's say your isp has already poisoned

495
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
that website and it's sending their ip

496
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
address instead of actual google website

497
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
so that would like continue to show in

498
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,400
your browser until unless you clear that

499
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
cache it's called the cache so that's

500
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
why you need to clear the cache and

501
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,840
there's a link how you can do

502
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
that i'll just quickly show where you

503
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
can set this settings for different

504
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,520
browsers

505
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,799
um

506
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,120
okay first let me talk about the second

507
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,559
case so that was the first case where

508
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,720
you add the default dns set by the row

509
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
by the isp the second case is where

510
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
there is a transparent proxy so any

511
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
traffic that you are sending on port 53

512
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
that is being

513
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
transferred to the proxy and being like

514
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
like a fake response is being reverted

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,679
from that

516
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,000
so to bypass that we have technical

517
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
solutions like dns over https and dns

518
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
over tls

519
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
i'm stressing more on dns over https for

520
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
a reason i'll just talk about it let's

521
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
first talk about dns over tls so tls is

522
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
basically what powers the https the

523
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
security layer of https and that's how

524
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,280
your whole

525
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
network whole data that's going through

526
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
your website or the encrypted web page

527
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,679
that you get and the reason why no one

528
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
is able to sniff your credit card

529
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
details that is because of tls so tls

530
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
make sure that your connection between

531
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
your browser and the website that you

532
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
are going that's encrypted and the same

533
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,799
is happening on dns now that you can

534
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
basically encrypt that data and so

535
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
that's why it's called dns over tls

536
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
the reason people don't prefer dns over

537
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,000
tls is because it's limited to a port

538
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
called port port number 853

539
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
so again what the

540
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
isps can do is they can route the

541
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
traffic to port 853 to their website

542
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,559
their dns server and give you a fake

543
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
response over that so that's why dns

544
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
over https is preferred because in dns

545
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
or http tps it's a normal http

546
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
connection or rather https connection

547
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
which is sent to our port 443 so it's

548
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
like a normal browser traffic so it goes

549
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,919
through the cloudflare or whichever dns

550
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,360
over https

551
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,840
server you have chosen and the whole

552
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,320
dns request or getting the ip address is

553
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,919
sent as a http https request so to block

554
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
that they would have to route all the

555
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
port 443 traffic that would be humongous

556
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,520
and

557
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
i mean the volume itself won't be able

558
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
to like you won't be able to know which

559
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
data is inside it because the whole of

560
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
the dns request is encrypted inside the

561
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
http bracket

562
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
so that's the reason why dns over https

563
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,280
is preferred

564
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
cloudflare has their domain cloudflare

565
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
iphonedns.com

566
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
dns query

567
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,799
so you might ask yeah see in the

568
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,320
previous cases we saw that dns was 1.1.1

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,799
or it was a ip address but here you have

570
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
the https so it's because this whole

571
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
fetching the dns responses or fetching

572
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
the ip address of the machine it's it is

573
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
in itself

574
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
uh what is it it is in itself an http

575
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
the packet thing the getting an html

576
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
page kind of thing

577
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
you can also have open dns and quad 9 on

578
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
the same on desktop firefox you can even

579
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,159
have doh by from the network setting

580
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,039
itself

581
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
doh is not enabled on android till now

582
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
you can have dns or tls i have it on my

583
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
mobile phone in some countries that's

584
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,640
not preferred like while i was coming

585
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,679
from

586
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,919
india i had a layover in abu dhabi so

587
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
their private dns or dns over tls was

588
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,679
not working so i had to switch back to

589
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
the normal dns but in other cases

590
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
the reason i told you like dns over tls

591
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
can be monitored and can be stopped but

592
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
dns over https can't be because it's the

593
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,320
same as https traffic

594
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,559
so for android i think they have started

595
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,960
experimentally in android 12 but it's

596
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,520
not yet rolled out

597
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,039
uh yeah so this is the firefox screen uh

598
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,640
let me just quickly show you where you

599
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,760
can do this

600
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,080
so here's the settings for this you just

601
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
search for dns here

602
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
in the settings you can see enable dns

603
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
over https cloudflare next dns and the

604
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
custom in the custom you can add quad 9

605
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,679
and other kinds of stuff

606
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,320
i have dns over https

607
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,080
in this

608
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
then if you use brave or chrome any of

609
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,000
those in the security settings privacy

610
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
and security

611
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,640
you have this use secure dns and inside

612
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,520
you can have cloudflare 1.1.1 and other

613
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
kinds of privacy in the san

614
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
things like that

615
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,799
for android this is the screen uh in

616
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
iphone i think it's the dns over https

617
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,280
is already there i

618
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
have not tested it but i think it's

619
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,840
there from android 9 and above you have

620
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
this option in the wi-fi and network

621
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
settings

622
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
so this is a screen in my mobile phone

623
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
this is what the settings are i have

624
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,240
cloudflare enabled onto that for

625
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,600
tls you need to have 1.1.1

626
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,559
and these are the instructions for it

627
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,799
you can also have 1.1 dot in the

628
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,679
alphanumeric way

629
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,240
okay

630
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
um you can go and set up dns over tls

631
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
for this

632
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,559
now if you want to check check your

633
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
current dns security you can just go to

634
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,200
this website let me show you here i

635
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
already have it up

636
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,520
so

637
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
so you can see it is checking and

638
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,600
connectivity resolver so

639
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
as name

640
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,080
cloudflare is it connected to 1.1.1.1

641
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,960
yeah

642
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,799
and is it using dns over https yes

643
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,080
let me just

644
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
disable this and see if that's actually

645
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
working or not

646
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
let's refresh this

647
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,360
so you can see dns over std basis no

648
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,120
let me just re-enable this

649
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
okay cool

650
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
now let's come to the second part of it

651
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,919
which is the http censoring

652
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,240
this has been seen in like i've been

653
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,840
collecting uh

654
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
network data in india through a

655
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,400
different a lot of different isps and

656
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
i've seen it

657
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
being done in one form or the other by

658
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
almost all of these isps because the

659
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
government mandates that some websites

660
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
need to be blocked so one in one way or

661
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
the other there is some kind of http

662
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
censoring so if you see on the screen in

663
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
the bottom side this is cloudy dot pk

664
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
it's a pakistani website

665
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
i think it hosts free movie content and

666
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
things like that so if you see here

667
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,159
there's this message this website has

668
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,760
been logged as per the order of ministry

669
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,200
of electronics and information

670
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,679
technology under it 2000

671
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,480
so

672
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,360
and if in if you see here there's a not

673
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
secure sign so it's an html website and

674
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
that's why they're able to modify the

675
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,679
content of the website whereas if you go

676
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,679
to the https version of it you would

677
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
straight away get a connection regis

678
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,080
connection reset packet i'll have a

679
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
screenshot of that as well

680
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
so that's what i was talking about we'll

681
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
talk about how this is happening and how

682
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
they're able to do it

683
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
so

684
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,080
yeah

685
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
so

686
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
how many of you have seen

687
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
why shark or know about wireshark

688
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,039
cool

689
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,400
a lot of guys

690
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,960
okay so wireshark is a tool that helps

691
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,120
you capture your raw network packets and

692
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,279
you can basically the thing that you see

693
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
on your browser it's the http request

694
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,240
but

695
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
before that there are a lot of things

696
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,480
that happen on the tcp ip stack and a

697
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
lot of

698
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
different kinds of what you say it's

699
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
called packets that transmit data to

700
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,440
make that thing happen

701
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
so this is a screenshot of it i already

702
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,000
have a uh let me show you i have a

703
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,679
wireshark

704
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,159
thing running

705
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
where is that

706
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
um

707
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
yep

708
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,320
so

709
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,120
let me just

710
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,200
cool

711
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,159
so

712
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,400
yeah

713
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,679
okay

714
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,400
so if you see these are raw packets so

715
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,520
from one it's starting from here and

716
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
some requests are being captured because

717
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,799
the your machine so it captures all the

718
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,200
data that is getting all the basically

719
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
network request that is being

720
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
transmitted from your device to outside

721
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
internet so that's how you see a lot of

722
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,159
these things there in the green one if

723
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,880
you see there's this get request and let

724
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
me just try to follow this so this

725
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
follow tcp stream basically what it

726
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,919
would do is it would just

727
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,600
show you that particular stream or

728
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
requests and responses for that

729
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,480
particular ip address and destination so

730
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
otherwise you would have a lot of data

731
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
from other places as well so if you see

732
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
in the top there's this

733
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
get request

734
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,039
and it's http 1.1 host is cloudy dot pk

735
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,000
and in the response you see http 1.1 200

736
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,399
okay 200 okay is the status quo when you

737
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,559
get a like a valid response from the

738
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,840
server

739
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
so everything looks fine content length

740
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
is 252.

741
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,000
if you see the content actual content

742
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
you can see this that

743
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,480
um let me show you yeah

744
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,159
there's this iframe which is src airtel

745
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,559
dot in slash dot

746
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
and then there's this 301 moved

747
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,799
permanently title and

748
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,679
the document has moved this is

749
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,720
so

750
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
it might get confusing that it also

751
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,559
shows the document has moved to this

752
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
https website so let me just tell you

753
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,640
what happened here

754
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
uh this

755
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
bottom part

756
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,679
this bottom part is the actual thing

757
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
that was being sent from the server

758
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
because it was an http website so it was

759
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,720
being redirected to its https version

760
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
and the way it was being

761
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,159
like the way it was being done was by

762
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
showing uh what you say a small http

763
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
html webpage where it was showing that

764
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,320
this document has moved to this

765
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
particular website which was the https

766
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,279
version of it

767
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
what the internet servers provider did

768
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,399
was it added on top of all that html

769
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,279
content yeah it added its own meta tag

770
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,360
and then iframe which shows this thing

771
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
let me show you what what's there on

772
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,799
this

773
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,799
um

774
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,200
i think let me just continue

775
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
so yeah this is the thing that you're

776
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,799
seeing and that's why you see that

777
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,159
you see that

778
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,080
message on the page when you go to

779
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,720
cloudy.pk

780
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,440
so basically in this case what happened

781
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
was the isp because it was an

782
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
unencrypted traffic so the isp was able

783
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,360
to determine that it's a blocked website

784
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,279
this is something that i have to censor

785
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
and once they figured out that okay this

786
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
is something i have to censor they added

787
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
their own iframe and basically discarded

788
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,480
all the html after that

789
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
so yep

790
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,360
so

791
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,039
uh you see that

792
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,440
one of the very basic bypasses is to use

793
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,240
the https version because these isps

794
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,640
they are usually very old technology

795
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,440
they don't always monitor they don't

796
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,679
block on all these phases so i've seen

797
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
in cases in some cases where if you go

798
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,279
to the https version of the website

799
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,080
directly you sometimes get access to it

800
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
that's not a foolproof way so i would

801
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,559
talk about how we can do that the other

802
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
method to bypass is you can use a vpn

803
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
which is a very common way

804
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
a lot of people would already know or

805
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
have been using it

806
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,679
there are places in and countries where

807
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
you can you can't use vpn like

808
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
and also there are places where if you

809
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,799
are using a vpn you would have to tell

810
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,440
the government collects all the vpn logs

811
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
so any activity that you do would be

812
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,559
basically monitored by the government so

813
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,679
their ways around it or rather methods

814
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,600
that you can use i would talk about it

815
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
later

816
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,960
i mean

817
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,720
so in the https connection we saw

818
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,159
initially that your traffic was

819
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,640
encrypted so you might ask yes if that

820
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,799
traffic is encrypted how are they gonna

821
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
block my network traffic how are they

822
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,120
gonna block the content that i'm seeing

823
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
so in this case

824
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,919
uh there's a host header that helps the

825
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,720
web server determine that okay this is

826
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,320
the particular website that the person

827
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,960
is trying to access and

828
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,000
that is what the isp also looks so

829
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
let me ask you a question so

830
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
uh you know what a web server is you

831
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,799
see that okay there are websites or you

832
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,240
might have your own website or something

833
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,919
like that so

834
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,279
you you might have seen wordpress

835
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,320
websites um anyone who has not seen or

836
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,919
who has seen a wordpress website just a

837
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,600
show of fans

838
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,559
cool

839
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,480
okay so do you think that each of these

840
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,159
websites are hosted on a different

841
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,720
computer or a single computer let's say

842
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
uh

843
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,039
two gigs of ram and 25 gb of

844
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,519
storage would it be sufficient for

845
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,000
hosting hundreds of website

846
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
i mean yep

847
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,080
so it's fairly common to assume that a

848
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,919
single web server single ip address

849
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,080
would be hosting multiple hundreds of

850
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,640
website if not right

851
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,360
so

852
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
how do

853
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
how does the web server determine that

854
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,080
okay you have given the ip address you

855
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,519
have given that okay i want a sim

856
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,120
straight dot in from this particular ip

857
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,200
address but how would that machine know

858
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,519
which website to serve because let's say

859
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,840
if it's an encrypted what do you say if

860
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,919
it's an encrypted traffic between you

861
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,000
and the machine the machine should know

862
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,760
how to encrypt that traffic because the

863
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,279
machine is already hosting hundreds of

864
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,360
website and each of these websites would

865
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
have a unique way of encrypting the

866
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,039
traffic that is called the key of that

867
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,640
particular machine or that particular

868
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,679
website

869
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,880
so

870
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,679
to do all this you the first request

871
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
that you send from your machine to that

872
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,200
particular server where you're getting

873
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
the

874
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,320
html page or webpage from you need to

875
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,799
tell that machine without encrypting

876
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,440
that hey i want a seamstream

877
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
and further connection would be between

878
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,559
me and that particular hosted website so

879
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,960
that is where your isp sniffs that and

880
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,039
gets to know that okay this is

881
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,360
which website this particular

882
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,440
person is trying to do and that is

883
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,399
called

884
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,360
uh it's called server name indication so

885
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,799
it's uh

886
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,519
extension of tls so tls is the transport

887
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,559
layer security which gives us the https

888
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,200
privilege that we have right now so the

889
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
the packet i would show you the packet

890
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
as well in the packet it's an

891
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,559
unencrypted packet so a lot of things

892
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,480
that happen in the tails initially

893
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
before

894
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,039
like before starting the encrypted

895
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,519
connection that happens over clear text

896
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,080
clear text meaning that happens over a

897
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,159
non-encrypted channel and that's where

898
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,000
these isps come into picture and they

899
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,760
try to sniff that and try to basically

900
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,120
block your access there

901
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,559
yeah this is the flow of it

902
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,360
so

903
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
there's a synth you don't need to

904
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,519
understand all that but let me just uh

905
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
take you to the important parts client

906
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,159
is you that's the server so there's a

907
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
syn packet that's been sent there's an

908
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,519
acknowledgement that comes from the

909
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,000
server that's with us in act packet

910
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,919
there's a packet here then

911
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,240
this is the client hello this is an

912
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,480
important one because this has

913
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,000
a lot of things yeah this also has the

914
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,840
server name indication thing which

915
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
mentions that okay this is the

916
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,040
particular host or this is the

917
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
particular website that i want from you

918
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,119
so it would send that packet the in

919
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,879
response the server would send a server

920
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
hello certificate and server hello done

921
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,199
the certificate is the one that would

922
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
help create the encrypted channel

923
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
between your machine and the server

924
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,480
so this part is the unencrypted one and

925
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
this is where your isps come into

926
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,879
picture

927
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
are you able to read this

928
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,520
[Music]

929
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
i also have this okay let me just pull

930
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,639
that up

931
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,200
okay so this is the

932
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,160
https version of cloudy.pk when i try to

933
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
access it in india there's this if you

934
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
see here there's this client hello

935
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,280
packet and this is rst or the reset

936
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
packet so reset packet happens whenever

937
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,440
the server wants to terminate the

938
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
connection or whenever they want to

939
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,280
close the connection

940
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,720
so yep

941
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,440
but this is not um

942
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,560
let me show you

943
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,440
um

944
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,920
rather i don't even need this one

945
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,839
so if you go and click on the client

946
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
hello packet and if i show you the tls

947
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,440
part

948
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,800
so

949
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
inside this

950
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,400
so you see a lot of extensions here this

951
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
one is a server name indication

952
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
and

953
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,320
you can see the host name and there's

954
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
this server name cloudy dot pk so this

955
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
is an unencrypted traffic that goes

956
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,800
through your isp so isp read this and

957
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
once they read it and they found that

958
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
it's in the blacklist they block this

959
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,040
traffic altogether and the blocking

960
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
happens by sending a reset packet

961
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
because once the connection happens they

962
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
won't be able to filter and add their

963
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,040
own

964
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,839
like this iframe that shows you a notice

965
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,359
so that's why they just stop the

966
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,359
connection any further

967
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
and that's what's it's here

968
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,000
post this if this goes through the

969
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,599
encryption happens and further they

970
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,079
can't be able to decrypt or add their

971
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,400
data into it so they just reset the

972
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
connection

973
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,839
oh yeah that's what's mentioned here

974
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,240
so now you would ask e now how do i

975
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
bypass this so the very first thing is

976
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
you can use a vpn but let's say you are

977
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,320
in the place where vpn is banned or if

978
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,960
using vpn is also a crime there are

979
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
places like that i don't know if you had

980
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
the privilege of going to those places

981
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,440
but

982
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
there are places where vpn is banned and

983
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
even in india recently it happened that

984
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
if you have vpn and the companies who

985
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
are operating vpn they need to have vpn

986
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,119
logs so i remember expressvpn they

987
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,079
run on

988
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,800
ram in in the ram vpn so they stopped

989
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
operations in india i think so i'm not

990
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,560
very sure but something like that

991
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,440
happened

992
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,240
so we are gonna do a diy so we are gonna

993
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,240
make our own vpn even simpler because

994
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,079
my it might be that vpn is a very

995
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,839
complicated stuff for a lot of people

996
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
although the other easy implementations

997
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,000
are one click implementation for that

998
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
but ssh is something that everyone or

999
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
every system has that so we'll be i'll

1000
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,160
be showing you how

1001
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
i have been using it for some other

1002
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,240
purposes but i found that they can also

1003
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,160
be used to bypass censorship

1004
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,880
so there's this thing called ssh tunnel

1005
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
what happens is you have a

1006
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,359
vps or a virtual private server or

1007
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,800
machine in the country which is not

1008
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,920
censored

1009
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
and you basically do an ssh connection

1010
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,359
so you do an

1011
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,280
ssh connection to work on that machine

1012
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
or maybe get a remote access to that

1013
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,119
machine for any reason you do an ssh

1014
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,440
connection so that same connection can

1015
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,720
be used to

1016
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,800
route all of your traffic from your

1017
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,960
machine through that country and outside

1018
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,040
the world so basically your whole

1019
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,880
traffic is encrypted into the ssh

1020
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
connection and you are basically able to

1021
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,359
get a censorship free internet now i

1022
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,040
don't need to say that the downsides are

1023
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,240
you would get us

1024
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
restricted bandwidth or lower bandwidth

1025
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,280
but still

1026
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,480
i mean for some use cases it's good

1027
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,520
and all you need is this ssh tunnel

1028
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,760
command you just run it on your machine

1029
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
on your terminal on your powershell on

1030
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,079
your cmd on your mac where whatever you

1031
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,599
are using you just need to run this

1032
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,560
command

1033
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,280
and it's all there i mean

1034
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,839
if you try it it won't work because ssh

1035
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,000
tunnel is an alias

1036
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,400
so let me just show you how that works

1037
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
so yeah so

1038
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,079
are you able to read this

1039
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,320
let me

1040
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,640
so ssr10 is an alias for this and let me

1041
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,200
show you what

1042
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,920
so basically the command is ssh hyphen

1043
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
and hyphen d

1044
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,920
port 8080 8181 you can use any port that

1045
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,320
you want don't use port 443 because then

1046
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
it would be tampering with your traffic

1047
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
hyphen f bbty i would tell you what bbty

1048
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,280
is you would have to use something

1049
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
different

1050
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
the later half is just to print out the

1051
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,440
connection whether it has been

1052
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
established or not

1053
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,839
so

1054
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,000
let first show you what it is it would

1055
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,560
be easier to understand so yeah this is

1056
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
the actual thing uh

1057
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
hyphen f after that i have used bbty

1058
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,760
it's uh i'll show you what that is but

1059
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
instead you have to use the username at

1060
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,960
the rate ip address or the remote host

1061
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,040
let me just quickly show you

1062
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,119
so

1063
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,800
um this is my configuration file

1064
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,680
so if you see bbty is a host that i have

1065
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,640
it's a

1066
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,320
server that i have set up on daily

1067
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
lotion so i use it for a lot of things

1068
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,440
including

1069
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
my analytics on my website so i use it

1070
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,800
for

1071
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,280
routing traffic so let me just quickly

1072
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,490
show you this

1073
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,240
[Music]

1074
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,520
so currently my ip address is amsterdam

1075
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,920
one five one two one seven now let me

1076
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,800
enable this asset tunnel

1077
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
so yeah this is enabled port 8081 so

1078
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,960
8181 i have this foxy proxy uh i have

1079
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,119
this ss tunnel here

1080
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,960
let me refresh this so you would see

1081
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,599
this clifton nj us now my traffic is

1082
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,839
being routed through a u.s server and

1083
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,640
that's where my data lotion server is

1084
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
you might ask what foxy proxy is and the

1085
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
thing let me just show you quickly it's

1086
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,680
basically it creates a

1087
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,640
sox5 proxy for ip address is one two

1088
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,599
seven zero zero one port is 8181 you can

1089
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,680
do the same thing by going to settings

1090
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
and manually setting this up and all

1091
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,839
that foxy proxy is an extension that

1092
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,160
helps me easily do that by just clicking

1093
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,520
on this and switching the proxy

1094
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,800
whichever i want

1095
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
so that's why

1096
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
let's come back to this

1097
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
and the vps is cheap you can get that

1098
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,720
for as low as five dollar per month you

1099
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
can use a vpn that's also cheaper

1100
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,119
whichever way you prefer

1101
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,440
this is setting up your own diy of your

1102
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
own vpn

1103
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,640
it's a project by

1104
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,440
google uh it's jigsaw is the project

1105
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,520
which makes these kinds of things where

1106
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,560
you have

1107
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
ways of open internet of freedom of

1108
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,040
speech thing so

1109
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,319
they have this

1110
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,319
what you call outline

1111
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,400
get outline is the website i have the

1112
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
link here you can just click download

1113
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,880
the software you can add the credentials

1114
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
of your data lotion vps or your google

1115
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,079
cloud vps or amazon vps and sorry amazon

1116
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,160
machine it would set up the vps onto

1117
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,800
that and give you an access the good

1118
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
part is that you don't have to do ssh or

1119
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,560
anything and they have mobile clients

1120
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,520
they have

1121
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
mac linux clients so you can once you

1122
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
have the vps setup on that you can run

1123
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,520
it from any of your devices you can

1124
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,960
access it from any of your devices

1125
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,160
there's a tool that i was using to uh

1126
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,920
it's a golang what do you say golang

1127
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,680
tool i have been using it and for

1128
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,040
collecting data

1129
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
it basically sends get requests to

1130
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
thousands or 1500 of these websites so

1131
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
i'm using citizen labs test list so

1132
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
certain citizen lab is a

1133
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
organization that

1134
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
works for human rights and those kinds

1135
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,920
of things so they have a test list and

1136
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,400
they have country wide country wise

1137
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
assorted list where you can get the

1138
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,240
websites that are blocked it's not very

1139
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,640
up to date but yeah you can still find

1140
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,720
quite websites quite like thousands or

1141
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
500 of websites for each of these

1142
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
countries and all so i mostly have used

1143
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
global website list and i'll show you in

1144
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
a minute how we can run this

1145
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,160
the these are the results for the cam so

1146
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,079
these are things that it does and if you

1147
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,000
see here

1148
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,760
in the bottom right there's a good isp

1149
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
tick so if it's a good isp if it isn't

1150
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,079
blocking any of these so it's a good isp

1151
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,599
it is being determined you can check in

1152
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,200
the code it is being determined on the

1153
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,839
basis of the dns responses so if the dns

1154
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,560
response is one of the isps dns then

1155
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,720
it's basically filtering that if in the

1156
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
response instead of the actual website

1157
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
you are getting a notice kind of thing

1158
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,240
then it's a blocked it's a censored

1159
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
website if you are getting a connection

1160
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,640
reset so then it's a sensor like it's a

1161
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
censored isp so all these things are

1162
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,880
being taken into account let me just

1163
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,920
show you a quick demo

1164
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,560
uh

1165
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,799
so

1166
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
it's kindly in the debug mode so it's

1167
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,520
basically trying to check

1168
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
go to hundreds of thousands of website

1169
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,240
and trying to get the title of it and

1170
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,800
all those things the status quo

1171
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,280
so it's it's a bit modular whereas you

1172
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
can write your own filters there's a

1173
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,920
yaml file filtering.ml you can like

1174
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
let's say you're working because i don't

1175
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,200
know the different kind of notices being

1176
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,119
served in different countries so you can

1177
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,880
add your own text string that you find

1178
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,119
that like in india you see this website

1179
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,599
is blocked by the department of telecom

1180
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,280
but in your country it might be in a

1181
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
german language or invite via in a

1182
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,960
different language so in that case you

1183
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
can just add it into the yaml file and

1184
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,560
you don't have to touch the code here

1185
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
i have i think made this

1186
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,640
repo public there are few issues that

1187
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,920
i'm working around but yeah

1188
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
let's come back to this file it's

1189
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,879
closing up

1190
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,880
so yeah this is a summary of all these

1191
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,319
this bypass about dna script i haven't

1192
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,640
mentioned about it because it might be a

1193
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,400
bit complicated and i wanted that

1194
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,560
something a solution that everyone can

1195
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,480
use and like if you're a reporter if

1196
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,839
you're activated or you're a journalist

1197
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,400
and you want to send data to your back

1198
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,920
organization and you're working a place

1199
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,000
where you are your all data is being

1200
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,839
monitored you can straight away use

1201
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,000
these

1202
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,319
uh that's the end of it there's a

1203
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,560
further reading i have the links if you

1204
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
want to

1205
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,960
add resources

1206
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,280
you sleep happily

1207
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,760

thank you asim so are there questions

1214
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
from the audience please if you have a

1215
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,599
question line up at the microphone i

1216
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,200
think there were no questions from the

1217
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,880
internet yes there were no questions

1218
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,480
from the internet maybe they were

1219
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,800
blocked i don't know so we have a

1220
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
question at the microphone

1221
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,800
thank you for your presentation i was

1222
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
wondering one of the reasons you said

1223
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
that

1224
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
well you made this presentation is

1225
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,640
because there are well i know american

1226
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,319
isps that monetize from your dns traffic

1227
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,240
and one of the suggestions you make is

1228
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,839
to either use cloudflare or google's dns

1229
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,480
isn't there well

1230
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,240
part of the same problem there that they

1231
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,880
monetize on your dna dns traffic as well

1232
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,280
i mean uh so the way the

1233
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,599
the these isps monetize dns is that

1234
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,200
let's say if you have a domain name

1235
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,520
that's not being owned by anyone so they

1236
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,520
would redirect to an advertisement page

1237
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,960
kind of thing but if you go on

1238
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
cloudflare and google dns they just give

1239
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,000
you

1240
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,400
not no domain response they don't like

1241
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,200
they don't do that so i mean that's

1242
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,359
right

1243
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,480
i hope that answers

1244
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,440
well if i can elaborate

1245
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,359
i i agree but they do

1246
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,760
monetize on your traffic

1247
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,359
building a profile

1248
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,960
um

1249
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,839
around your well dns

1250
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,040
and therefore

1251
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,440
um i know specialized advertisements

1252
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,680
they serve you and stuff like that

1253
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,599
so there's like a privacy

1254
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,920
i get it what do you mean say

1255
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,480
it's a bit weak because the dns traffic

1256
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,960
is a lot and in many cases like let's

1257
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,720
say if you are going to google a common

1258
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,960
news website that you go so in many

1259
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,640
cases that's already caged on the

1260
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,400
browser so the request doesn't go again

1261
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,880
to cloudflare or they don't go against

1262
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,440
google's dns servers so that's why you

1263
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,280
can have it i mean that's why it's not

1264
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,800
part of it

1265
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,040
thank you we have time for another quick

1266
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,000
question and answer

1267
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,920
okay thank you for your talk um a brief

1268
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,880
question if i'm about to use dns over

1269
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,800
https

1270
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,520
and let's assume i used cloud

1271
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,480
counselor as an operator

1272
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,680
and as you've shown the dms address is

1273
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,000
being put into the field uh

1274
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,800
of choosing dns over https which

1275
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,400
resolver is being used to resolve that

1276
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,359
address i mean you can use even the

1277
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,280
i thought don't ask this question

1278
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,920
because and so you can use the isp dns

1279
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,839
also because you are basically resolving

1280
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
a public domain like a cloudflare

1281
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,680
dns.com or google.com let's say for

1282
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,760
example so that's not blocked because

1283
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,920
blocking that is blocking a major part

1284
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
of the internet so once that's resolved

1285
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,480
then the request goes to that so if you

1286
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,160
don't have like let's say if you're

1287
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,520
using the

1288
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,079
cloudflare iphonedns.com so that request

1289
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,480
goes through your what you say your isp

1290
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
or your local dns that's there and then

1291
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,160
that response comes together and if

1292
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,079
they'll fake

1293
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,440
the address of that

1294
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,119
dns name and provide me with a valid

1295
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,640
certificate

1296
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,520
will that work i mean but how do you get

1297
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,839
the valid ssl certificate for the let's

1298
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,359
say a google.com dns over https

1299
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,559
we are aware of malicious

1300
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,440
sites in which you can arrange a faked

1301
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,480
in

1302
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,559
https uh

1303
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,160
certificate i mean the fake ca

1304
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,400
certificate yeah

1305
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,359
and then

1306
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,040
that then that would be a bigger problem

1307
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
than just the dns part

1308
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,079
i mean

1309
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,319
the story was like that a couple of

1310
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,920
times already

1311
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,839
so sorry we are running out of time

1312
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,000
please uh do this discussion after the

1313
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,400
talk uh no we have no time for another

1314
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
question sorry

1315
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,440
uh thank you team

1316
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,559
for telling us how to bypass censorship

1317
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,559
and if you have a question please come

1318
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,160
to him and discard it with him

1319
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,160
afterwards
