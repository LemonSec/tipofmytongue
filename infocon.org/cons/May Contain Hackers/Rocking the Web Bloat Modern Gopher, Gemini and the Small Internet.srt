[Music]

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
all right so uh the the talk tonight is

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,920
uh rocking the web blout uh modern

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,119
gopher gemini and the small internet so

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,920
thomasino is gonna uh present for you

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
the web is a mess bloated with data

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
gathering trackers predatory ux massive

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
resource loads and it is absorbing

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
everything it touches

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
the small internet

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
is a countercultural movement to wrangle

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,079
things back under control by minimalism

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
hands-on participation and good

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
old-fashioned conversation

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,599
tomasino take it away

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,079
hi

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,160
hi all right hey there we go

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
and there we go

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,199
um thanks everybody for coming out i

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,199
want to talk to you a little bit about

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
the places on the internet that don't

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
suck

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
there's not a lot of it but it's okay we

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
don't need a lot of it to have fun

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
um so this is this is the small internet

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
this is a counter cultural movement that

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
has been

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,840
uh well it's been around since the

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,799
beginning

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,119
but it has a new name now in the face of

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,360
what has become

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
this monolith this

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
uh capitalist

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
overwhelming

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
entity that has taken over and and

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,640
become my day job um so i am a marketer

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
um i spend all my days doing all those

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
horrible advertising things that we hate

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,280
so much and when i'm done

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
that i like to go to my small corners of

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
the internet where i can have

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
conversations with friends where i can

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
be at peace not be tracked and uh and

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
remember the good old days

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
when i was young

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
for me that was bbs's

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
i'd just gotten dialed up and i wanted

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,038
to

49
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,520
you know explore this new world out

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
there and i dialed into my local bbs and

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
found forums found people that i could

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
chat with and that essence is still

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
there it's still in the web um it hasn't

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
been taken completely over by facebook

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,879
um

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,920
but

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
in order to get to it and to feel safe

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
doing it um people bend over backwards

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
we we are faced with this overwhelming

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
entity now

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,080
that is

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
this modern web and it's intimidating so

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,519
today i'm going to talk to you a little

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,920
bit about what that small web looks like

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
where you can find it

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,959
we're going to talk about the technical

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
details of some of the platf or some of

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
the protocols

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,319
that you can use to get there and we're

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
going to talk about the sociological

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
aspects of why people are coming to it

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
yeah so let's dive right in

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
at the end we should have time for q a

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
uh if i run along and if we don't you

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
can find me at the quarantine arms tent

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
it is that way in lamar field with lots

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
of inflatable things

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,800
real easy to spot

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
all right so i'm not going to spend a

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
lot of time on this because i'm pretty

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
sure this crowd knows very well what the

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
state of the web is today uh but i just

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
wanted to run through a few highlights

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
um

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
it is run by very few companies

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
the vast majority of the data online

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
um your data our data is running through

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
very few narrow ports of entry and it's

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
being harvested it's being watched it's

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
being used it's being monetized

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
this is not news but

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
it's it's our reality

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,879
moreover people are embracing it we see

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
overwhelming numbers of people diving

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
into these

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
individual monolithic platforms

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
thriving there

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
moving on to the next one thriving there

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,879
but they've lost something right they

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
lost that sense that we had of small

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,238
community

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
uh you can be a tick talker you could be

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
a youtuber but you can't be your local

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
neighborhood tick-tocker

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
you can't be your local neighborhood

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
youtuber

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
uh this data is from the u.s

108
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
but it speaks to i think a worldwide

109
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
feeling of lack of control

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
knowing that those trackers are there

111
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
people feel helpless they feel

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
overwhelmed they feel like there's

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,199
nothing they can do about it why care

114
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
even if they do care right try to

115
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
dismiss it try to move on now some of

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
this crowd i'm sure

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
has taken really rigorous steps to

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
mitigate this

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
but the vast majority of people don't

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
this is the most aggressive stats i

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,000
could find of just ad blockers

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
in in these most aggressive stats we see

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,759
in our youngest audience not even half

124
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
of people are using

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
an ad blocker

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
it's kind of

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
shocking really i know

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
you're all probably let's see show of

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
hands how many people here use an ad

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,720
blocker

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
right

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
right

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
apparently uh 51 or 50.8 of males 16 to

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
24.

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
um

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,720
now

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
the reason i bring this up is because

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
the audience that participates in these

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
small internet uh those people who have

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,280
self-selected to do so are a lot like

141
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
this crowd

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
i ran the survey recently

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,759
where i asked people that consider

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,520
themselves part of the small internet a

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
series of questions

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
one of those questions was what

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
technologies do you regularly use in

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
browsing the web

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
we have over 90 percent use of ad

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
blockers or pie holes or some other

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
rigorous method of blocking heads but

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,639
also you we have some

153
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
hey look at that i've got a mouse

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
huh

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
we have some other things that are in

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,680
common use over 25 percent of users of

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
the small internet are comfortable using

158
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,400
a text browser

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
how many people here have used a text

160
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
browser in the last year

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
yeah this is my audience that's right

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
there you go

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
now what i do want to point out here

164
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,639
just before we move on uh you'll see

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
somewhere between 25 and 50 of people

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
disable javascript this comes up over

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,840
and over again um as we get into the the

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,240
whys and hows and what what a small

169
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
internet user looks like there is not a

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
common definition amongst everybody and

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
there are some people that are very

172
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
adamant that

173
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
to be small internet you can't have

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
javascript

175
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
and there are others that well don't

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,560
care so much there's other things that

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,800
are more important

178
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,639
what are the motivations for people

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,400
this was an open-ended question in that

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,720
survey and i got hundreds well

181
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,039
331 responses uh this is a word cloud

182
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,520
based on those responses

183
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
and you'll see some things trickling to

184
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
the surface here

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
although there are different reasons

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
that drive people to the small internet

187
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,720
to participate in these small

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
communities and avoid surveillance

189
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,160
capitalism

190
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
at least for some of their their time

191
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
online

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,919
the the motivations

193
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,280
vary from

194
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
community and people simplicity

195
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
to specific protocols you might notice

196
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,800
gophers named there

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
um early internet

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
a little more specifically

199
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
i gave them categorized responses and

200
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,560
said what is the main motivation for

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,520
this

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
and interestingly the number one was the

203
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,199
technologies the the actual tech itself

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,599
being off of the web

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
and on something like gopher or gemini

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
which i will discuss in a little bit

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,400
those

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,879
were major drivers also the idea of

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,080
community though

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,199
a major driver as well

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
so i've talked a lot about it but i

212
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,919
haven't actually spelled out what the

213
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
small internet is so let's do that real

214
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
quick and then we can dive into some of

215
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
the specifics

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
uh asking our users of the small

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
internet who who all say they are

218
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,479
members of it

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
asking them what it is i got a ton of

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,679
answers and some of them will go beyond

221
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,640
the scope of what we're going to talk

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
about tonight uh overwhelmingly uh

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
gemini was a leading one and we're gonna

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
talk in depth about that gopher had its

225
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
presence but we also saw a lot of people

226
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,920
that consider mailing lists part of the

227
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,240
small internet uh irc servers uh use net

228
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
or net news protocol

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
not necessarily tied into usenet

230
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
uh

231
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
the centerverse popped up a lot and

232
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
mastodon popped up a lot but always with

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
caveats some corners of the photoverse

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
not everything

235
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
so it's interesting to see what people

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
consider it but if you kind of take a

237
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
step back and blur your eyes a little

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
bit

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
what all of these things have in common

240
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
is

241
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,279
that

242
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
they're defined

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
by being oriented toward that individual

244
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
experience

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,360
the

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
individual is not treated

247
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
as a customer

248
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
uh to be sold something

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
the content

250
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,560
is the individual it is our interactions

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
also all of the people that responded

252
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
were looking somehow to avoid a

253
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,920
centralized system or a corporate system

254
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
and they were looking for deeper

255
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
connections um conversations

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
connectivity a lot of the same kind of

257
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,519
philosophies that you see from slow

258
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
movements slow textiles slow cooking the

259
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,519
way that we can intentionally be with

260
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,440
whatever we're engaging with that's what

261
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
they're looking for

262
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
so being a participant

263
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,519
and not being tracked

264
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,279
and not being commercial

265
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,160
now i i put an asterisk on this because

266
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,680
uh

267
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,040
well before we got too far in here

268
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
uh a common thing that pops up

269
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
before we get into gopher in gemini a

270
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
common thing that comes up is can't i

271
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
just do that on the web and the answer

272
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,120
is yes everything you're going to see

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
here tonight we can do on the web but

274
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
what you can't do on the web is click a

275
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
link and know that where you're going

276
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
isn't going to track you

277
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
it's always a possibility somebody

278
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,760
else's site might have something

279
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,040
and so there's

280
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,519
an unknown factor there's a lack of

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
safety there that your browsing which is

282
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,440
small and cozy could all of a sudden end

283
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
up

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
somewhere foreign yeah we're back

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
all right

286
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
so the same

287
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
small internet users are asking where do

288
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
you where do you go where do you spend

289
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
your time

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,560
gopher and gemini big ones self-hosted

291
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
individual websites the ones that they

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
control big time

293
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,360
who here runs your own website

294
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,160
all right who here has links on your

295
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,320
website to other websites you find

296
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
interesting

297
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,320
all right who used to

298
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
all right so that that mentality of that

299
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
circle of friends that circle of trust

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
that circle of this is interesting stuff

301
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
uh is prevalent heavily in in this

302
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
community and so the people that are

303
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
still doing it you're already

304
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
participating in the small internet

305
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
already

306
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
you might not have that name to it uh

307
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,720
but we're going to talk a little bit

308
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
more focused on

309
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
the the technologies that you might not

310
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
be spending all your time on all right

311
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,839
what makes it small internet we've

312
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
talked about this

313
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,399
all right

314
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,519
hello

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
um

316
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,160
how much total time do people spend

317
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
in these little conversational areas um

318
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,480
with people in irc with people on the

319
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
fetaverse

320
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
or in gopher or gemini as part of their

321
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,600
total internet usage uh this is kind of

322
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,480
a pie chart breakdown of percentages so

323
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,440
what you'll notice here is

324
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,000
you like that

325
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
what you'll notice here is that the uh

326
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
the small number the less than five

327
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,639
percent

328
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
represents a relatively small portion of

329
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
the pie

330
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
most people that are on the small

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,519
internet are using the small internet

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
i try to think of the most horrible way

333
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
to visualize this and that's about it

334
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,800
all right

335
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
all right so let's talk about it in

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
practice um

337
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,920
a website

338
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
creating it having it hosted for

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,279
yourself

340
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,160
it's

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
nothing i need to cover here instead

342
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
we're going to talk about

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
two major protocols that are in use

344
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,440
right now that are the backbone of these

345
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
communities

346
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
uh gopher and gemini

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
starting with gopher

348
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,079
who is familiar with gopher

349
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,399
yes lots of hands okay let's try that

350
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
the other way who has not heard of

351
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
gopher before

352
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
okay all right cool cool cool we have a

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,440
couple

354
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
uh so what is gopher well this is from a

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,000
presentation that came out in 1992

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
by the creators of gopher introducing

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
gopher it is a distributed document

358
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
search and retrieval protocol it

359
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
supports browsing a hierarchical

360
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,680
collection of menus if this sounds at a

361
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
glance like ftp it's because it kind of

362
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
is

363
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
this was

364
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,480
a protocol

365
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
developed at the university of minnesota

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
golden gophers

367
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
named after their school mascot and it

368
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,160
was developed pretty much in a weekend

369
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
uh the the

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
school had been asking them to come up

371
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,079
with a method for creating a browsable

372
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,320
system where they can kind of bring all

373
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,959
of the offerings of the school together

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
and the team

375
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,279
had this crazy idea instead of making a

376
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
mainframe

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,519
app that people connect into what if

378
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,240
they just ran it on simple hardware and

379
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
they created a server client system that

380
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
could talk to each other

381
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
and uh the school hated the idea and

382
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,839
then told them to shut it down so they

383
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,199
built it really quick and put it on ftp

384
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,720
and it was a huge success uh it took

385
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
over the internet it was the internet

386
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
for a short time

387
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
it released in 1991 a few months before

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,639
tim berners-lee

389
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,399
put out

390
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
well the web

391
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,440
in fact the web was announced on gopher

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
so how does it work

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,480
it's a simple tcp connection on port 70

394
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
and you send

395
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
a selector

396
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
it is a string

397
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
and the server takes that string and

398
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,079
uses it to look up something and return

399
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,600
it to you

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
and that's the whole protocol

401
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
that's it

402
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,839
it's amazing

403
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
you guys could probably build it

404
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
while you're sitting here

405
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
right

406
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
yeah

407
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,399
all right

408
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,040
so a sample gopher session back in 1992

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
looked like this

410
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
uh it is very very similar to an ftp

411
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
experience there is hierarchical data

412
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
that you can browse through you could

413
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
click on different types of documents it

414
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
might be a text document that you

415
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,959
download it might be a binary file you

416
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
download the uh

417
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,079
it could link you to a telnet server or

418
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,120
to a dictionary file or to a ccso

419
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
name

420
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,519
server precursor to ldap

421
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,440
there's a limited

422
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
number of options about what you could

423
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
have connected to but at the time it was

424
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,040
everything everything on the web was

425
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
accessible through one

426
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,560
simple system

427
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
what you're seeing now

428
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
is the web or is the uh gopher space

429
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
being browsed today this is on links if

430
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
you have links installed you already

431
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
have a gopher client

432
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,279
um

433
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,519
if you connect to something with gopher

434
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
colon colon or colon slash whatever

435
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,519
you're on gopher

436
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,440
there are other better

437
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,199
designed clients like fetch which is

438
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,120
about to pop up here that support some

439
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
extra things like utf-8 and even

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
terminal

441
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,639
color codes

442
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,920
can make your

443
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,560
gopher session look really sexy

444
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
for text in the terminal

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,639
now the spec was built in 1991 and it

446
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
never really got an update there was a

447
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
try for a gopher plus that didn't take

448
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
off in fact

449
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,359
by that time the web was already on its

450
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,160
uh hockey stick rise to fame and gopher

451
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
was petering out there were some poor

452
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,039
decisions from the university tried to

453
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
trying to charge for servers that were

454
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
going to run it they were trying to

455
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,039
make a commercial

456
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
product out of it at a time when the

457
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
internet was still very much about free

458
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
it was about freedom

459
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,079
and it didn't go over well and it kind

460
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
of tanked

461
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,080
so as a result gopher uh slowly

462
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
dissolved away

463
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,039
and

464
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,160
um

465
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
it nearly disappeared as of about 2007

466
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
there was fewer than 100 gopher servers

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
left online

468
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
now before we get into

469
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
you know what's happened since i do want

470
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,720
to address some issues because this came

471
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
out in 91

472
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
and it never really had any major

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
updates like we've seen with the web

474
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,080
there are some issues one it's plain

475
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,360
text

476
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
which is either a good thing or a bad

477
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,160
thing for you

478
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
if you are running if you're a kind of

479
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
person that likes to run vintage

480
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
hardware this is great makes it really

481
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
easy you can run gopher on an nes

482
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
i've seen that it's really cool um

483
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
there's no support for small device

484
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
screens everything's designed to be a

485
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
fixed column or a fixed width and

486
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
displayed as such

487
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
the original gopher spec said less than

488
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
70 columns

489
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,200
these days people try to stick under 80.

490
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
but even so it's not comfortable on your

491
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
phone

492
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,360
and finally

493
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
the index format that we were seeing

494
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
browse through in those sessions is

495
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,679
awful

496
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
it is a criminally bad format they're

497
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,559
called gopher maps and it is a

498
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
line-based format

499
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
with a leading

500
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
fixed column

501
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
so there is there is one column at the

502
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
beginning

503
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
that is one character long that tells

504
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
you what that line means

505
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,600
then everything after that column is tab

506
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
delineated

507
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
including a description of select or

508
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
hostname and port

509
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
what kind of item types can you have in

510
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,160
that first column well here they are the

511
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
top list is what was released with

512
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
gopher when it came out in 1991

513
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,760
text file that's still relevant go for

514
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
sub menu or directory that's still

515
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,400
relevant

516
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
and

517
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
binary file

518
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
there you go

519
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,799
uh you could use jiffa although these

520
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
days people would probably just serve

521
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
you binary so basically it's dated

522
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
itself out of being useful this item

523
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
type thing

524
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
at the bottom these are some of the

525
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
other item types that evolved into

526
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,200
gopher through common usage

527
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,679
the type i is a descriptor line that

528
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
lets you put text in a menu kind of

529
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,919
describe what's happening and give some

530
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,080
structure to your page that was released

531
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
within a year

532
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
of gopher showing up uh the others came

533
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,280
rather later sound and the html being

534
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
one of the latest

535
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
editions that lets you link to urls

536
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
this at the bottom

537
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
is what an actual gopher

538
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
map file looks like in practice that is

539
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
a literal tab character there

540
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
you can't have spaces for tabs or it

541
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,280
won't work

542
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
but uh what you're seeing on the top is

543
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
kind of the the uh sections of that file

544
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,960
broken up for reference a file

545
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
description the path domain and port

546
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
i will note the path and file name part

547
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
it's commonly used as a path and file

548
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
name but technically gopher just defines

549
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,240
it as a selector it's a random string if

550
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
you want to do a random string that

551
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
matches something in a database you

552
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
could do that

553
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
some people do wikis instead

554
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
so there is no path structure it's just

555
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,120
all kind of flat

556
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
it is really awkward to work with

557
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
if you wanted to do some cool messages

558
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
they look like this

559
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
this is my gopher site

560
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,919
as seen through curl you'll see the same

561
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
thing at a netcat if you just uh pull

562
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,280
down port 70. it is atrocious now when

563
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,559
rendered

564
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,960
through a client it's nice but working

565
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
with this is troublesome and uh if you

566
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,840
are looking to get into gopher it's it's

567
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
really really an easy protocol to work

568
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
in but um i'm sure you like just about

569
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
all of us will start by making yourself

570
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
a little script that builds this

571
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,400
instead of having to do it by hand

572
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
so with that in mind oh yes scoffer is

573
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
still going strong i mentioned in 2007

574
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
there was fewer than 100 servers

575
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
today

576
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,200
there are 329 servers we've come back up

577
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,880
uh of those 320 329 servers there are

578
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
over five million

579
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
individual selectors those are different

580
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
files or resources available

581
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,240
gopher doesn't have a lot of servers

582
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
it's not very wide but it's very deep

583
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,280
and if you're in to

584
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,559
archaeology of the web uh or archaeology

585
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,960
of internet check out gopher whatever

586
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
you lost is probably

587
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,360
there so

588
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
gopher

589
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
how do we fix it

590
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,440
well uh common griping about

591
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,919
three four years ago was we need some

592
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,400
sort of encryption and there are some

593
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,600
people that have

594
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,320
experimented with throwing a tls wrapper

595
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
on gopher uh maybe using a different

596
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
port instead of 70

597
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,960
70 70.

598
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,280
and you can you can do that pretty

599
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,360
easily just with a

600
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
yeah with literally a wrapper

601
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,600
but the line wrapping on mobile is a

602
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
problem right everything's designed for

603
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
this fixed width it would be nice if we

604
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,440
had an adjustable

605
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
thing so we could use it on the devices

606
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
that are in our hands all the time

607
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
the item types are kind of useless and

608
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
we developed mime types later and they

609
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
are much more flexible that would have

610
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,679
been cool

611
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,440
we really need to get rid of the gopher

612
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
map if we could replace that with

613
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
something that was a little more

614
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,360
intuitive that would be really good

615
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
but

616
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
we don't want to lose track of what made

617
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,799
gopher great right we don't want to get

618
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,880
lost in the web's

619
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,080
vision of

620
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
improve it improve and improve it until

621
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
nobody can build a client anymore

622
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,919
because it's too complex so let's keep

623
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,919
it simple let's avoid the extensibility

624
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,720
that would be really cool

625
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
so let me tell you about gemini

626
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
gemini

627
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
is this

628
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,480
we've taken gopher we've stripped

629
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
uh

630
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
that plain text connection and wrapped

631
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
it in tls

632
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
we figured out how to do some line

633
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,080
wrapping let's use some mime types give

634
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
it a markup

635
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,919
hey you know what here we go

636
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
uh we will use tls and

637
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
in order to keep it easy to implement

638
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,679
we're not going to use um centralized

639
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,400
authorities for for kind of validating

640
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
that we're just going to use tofu

641
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
trust them first use so the first time

642
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
you hit it you got assert boom it's good

643
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
i trust you next time if it changed

644
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,520
though

645
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
i'm going to do a warning or something

646
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,360
you can handle it

647
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
soft wrapping will be the default we

648
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
want to support mobile devices but we

649
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
really liked ascii art so we're going to

650
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
put a pre-formatted block that you can

651
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
use in there

652
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
everything in gemini will use mime types

653
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,080
you can use any mime type you want but

654
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
in order to make this protocol

655
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
uh usable and not immediately fall into

656
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
the trap if it's just web under another

657
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,039
name we're gonna create a basic format

658
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,679
that all gemini servers and clients need

659
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
to be able to speak at a minimum and we

660
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
called it gem text

661
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,600
it looks a lot like markdown but it is

662
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
line based there's no inline semantics

663
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
so you have headers

664
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,559
you have

665
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,760
bullet

666
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
single not nested bullet

667
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,840
you have quote

668
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
these are things that you're used to

669
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
from markdown there's a couple other

670
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
little options but everything is line

671
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,039
based so the first three characters of

672
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,039
the line in gemini will tell you what it

673
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
is what it can do

674
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,919
uh and then the last two things are are

675
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,080
kind of a philosophical aspect of the

676
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
spec

677
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,919
the first one is that any interaction

678
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,640
you do in gemini whatever you click on

679
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,840
you're allowed as a client one request

680
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,360
to the server

681
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,520
that was what you just initiated there

682
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,600
is no chaining there's no

683
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
secondary resource loaded

684
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,640
certainly no javascript getting loaded

685
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,159
no css

686
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:46,880
the

687
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
styling of gemini content is up to the

688
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,240
client

689
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,080
if you don't like the styling of your

690
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,400
client you're free to use another client

691
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,679
because the whole idea of this was we

692
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
wanted to have something that you could

693
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,760
build a client in less than 100 lines of

694
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
code you could build a server in a

695
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,480
weekend

696
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
and as a result that's what people have

697
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,039
done there are just tons of clients and

698
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,240
servers available for for gemini

699
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,080
now this philosophical aspect i want to

700
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
talk about this is something that

701
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,120
probably doesn't fly in a ietf

702
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,840
spec dock but it was really important

703
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,799
that gemini when it was created it had a

704
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
vision of

705
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
not going down the path that the web did

706
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,080
it's not designed to replace the web

707
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,919
it's not designed to replace gopher it's

708
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,919
designed to provide an alternative a

709
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,120
place where

710
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
people that like

711
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,480
simple text content can browse safely

712
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
but they can do it from a more modern

713
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
device they can do it from their phone

714
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
it's not going to track you because

715
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,159
there's no mechanism to in fact it's

716
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
incredibly difficult to build in

717
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,279
tracking and impossible to build in

718
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,720
what you would consider like super

719
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
cookies you could track people

720
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,640
on your site if you dynamically rewrite

721
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
every single link

722
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
every time they click on one and follow

723
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
that pathway through but the second they

724
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,919
leave your site that information is gone

725
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,520
as a server you're provided

726
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
the selector gets sent to you

727
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,399
and uh

728
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,440
the

729
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
tls handshake

730
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,880
now tls is awesome because it allows us

731
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
to do some things that we don't do on

732
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
the web that are available uh we can

733
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,880
create client certificates in gemini

734
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
and clients good gemini clients are

735
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,480
built to do this so if you need to log

736
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
into a website if you wanted to have an

737
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
account on a website maybe

738
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,360
astrobotany which is a really popular

739
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
gemini site

740
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,320
you can

741
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
connect

742
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
your client certificate you've created

743
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,559
for that site and it will do the uh you

744
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,679
send the the signature across

745
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
there's that validation going on the

746
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,159
server ends up with a hash of your cert

747
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,880
and that hash becomes your id

748
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,159
and that's as simple as that you didn't

749
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,640
need to sign up for anything

750
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
and you can revoke it you can create

751
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,840
those on the fly if you want or you can

752
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,320
keep create long-lived ones it's really

753
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,120
quite flexible and building applications

754
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,679
in this is is really easy it's as simple

755
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600
as a cgi script

756
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
uh so what you're seeing here is a

757
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,480
gemini browser called crystal it's built

758
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
with qt

759
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,399
and i've got a nice dark mode styling

760
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,720
that i've put on here but

761
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
the links that you see

762
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
are

763
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
colon

764
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,520
not equal sign greater than sign

765
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
and that's kind of it like that's how

766
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
you link to things there's no inline

767
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
linking there's no underlines there's no

768
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,799
bold

769
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,679
there's no styling it's just information

770
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,760
there's hierarchy on the left-hand side

771
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
you see these document outline that's

772
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
being generated automatically based on

773
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,919
headers so you can jump around

774
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,799
and that's it it's very very simple

775
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,559
cosmic voyager just came up this is one

776
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,399
of my servers people

777
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
can sign up here and write little mini

778
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
sci-fi stories

779
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,600
and this gets to the heart of of the why

780
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,480
right

781
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
you're talking about the how here's uh

782
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
here's some gemtext code

783
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
you can kind of see the markdown ish

784
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
looking stuff happening

785
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,120
two different articles left and right

786
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,399
the how becomes quite easy compared

787
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
especially to a gopher gopher map

788
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
writing in something that looks vaguely

789
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,840
like markdown there are syntax files for

790
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
major editors available as well if you

791
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
want highlighting but authoring content

792
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
becomes really easy and the active

793
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
styling is taken away you don't need to

794
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,919
worry about it the ecosystem to host

795
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,799
this

796
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,840
is

797
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,080
something you could roll your own

798
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
or

799
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,080
it takes incredibly low resources to put

800
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,039
on to an existing server

801
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
gem text line based

802
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,880
first three characters determine the

803
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,760
line

804
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,679
uh line type

805
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,919
and there is the total amount of options

806
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,200
that are available to you you can have

807
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,640
an unordered list

808
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,520
three levels of headers no fourth level

809
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,480
links

810
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,279
quotes and there's a basic input it you

811
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,840
can enter small strings so that could be

812
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,159
used for search it could be used for

813
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,320
comments some people

814
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
have used it to create entire blog

815
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
systems you can just type it in

816
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
the design completely left to the client

817
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,640
we have

818
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,679
um i think it was the third

819
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,559
client that was built for gemini was an

820
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,918
auto auditory client

821
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,440
this is incredibly

822
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,399
good

823
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,320
for accessibility

824
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
the only element on here that's by its

825
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
nature not designed for accessibility is

826
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
the pre-formatted blocks which could

827
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,279
contain ascii art

828
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,120
there was some discussion over the first

829
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,440
couple years of the project and there is

830
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
a method now to include an alt text in

831
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,919
that as well a lot of times the

832
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,519
pre-formatted blocks are used for code

833
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,039
snippets in which case it would be

834
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
unnecessary that content could be read

835
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,159
but in cases where we want to avoid

836
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,480
somebody using a

837
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,440
an auditory display getting read a bunch

838
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
of periods and spaces and quotes

839
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,440
the alt text devices

840
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,399
now

841
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,679
gemini

842
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,880
launched in

843
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,480
2019

844
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,240
by 2021 the 1200 servers as of uh

845
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,200
two days ago there was

846
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,399
2560 servers

847
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
it has been growing very quickly but

848
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399
you'll notice

849
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,360
the total selectors available on gemini

850
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
only 400 000 or so compared to gopher's

851
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,559
5 million

852
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,679
so while gopher is small it is deep

853
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,640
gemini is wide

854
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,880
both are very exciting places

855
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,159
gemini is uh quickly quickly growing and

856
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,840
uh the big challenges that face right

857
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,519
now are awareness it doesn't have the

858
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
longevity the long history so the people

859
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
that are coming into the small internet

860
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
that do so from nostalgia

861
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,159
may hearken back and be like i wonder if

862
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,720
gopher is still around uh and stumble in

863
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,760
or they might discover a site like sds a

864
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
super dimensional fortress and realize

865
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
hey there's gopher available

866
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
gemini doesn't have that it's

867
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,519
it's hit hacker news a few times and

868
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,360
gotten some influx from there but

869
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,799
generally it's word of mouth that's been

870
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,720
spreading it so awareness continues to

871
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
be a challenge

872
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,960
authoring of content is a challenge

873
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,320
before non-technical users there is no

874
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,240
really simple system yet in place where

875
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,519
somebody can just sign up and create um

876
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
their their gemini site without having

877
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
to know how to code a little bit that's

878
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
a that's a problem that's being overcome

879
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,039
by some people that are creating web

880
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,000
interfaces for the authoring part of

881
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,279
gemiini

882
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
which is an interesting kind of work

883
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,000
around

884
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,840
the content's only browseable through

885
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,440
gemini but you can author it through a

886
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
webpage

887
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,399
and then finally

888
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,039
the philosophy itself of gemini is a

889
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,120
challenge for gemini

890
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,240
gemini grew out of a hacker community

891
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
from people that were like

892
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,919
we like gopher we want to hack on it

893
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
make it better

894
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,039
and now it's filled with hackers that

895
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,799
want to hack on it and make it better

896
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
but its philosophy is

897
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
don't hack on it and make it better we

898
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
want it to stop now

899
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,760
and that is constantly butting heads if

900
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
if you check out the

901
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,519
mailing list archives there's there's

902
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,679
actually a usenet channel for gemini

903
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,000
it's the first new usenet group that was

904
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,159
approved in like a decade

905
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,000
um there is a use in that group and if

906
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,240
you look in that you'll see tons and

907
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,320
tons of stuff of people saying i love

908
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,039
gemini i just wish it had

909
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,159
x

910
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,879
and x is always different and if we add

911
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,679
it all together you you have the web

912
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,839
so we have to draw the line in the sand

913
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,320
somewhere and

914
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
the the author of the original spec uh

915
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,040
solder punk i think he did a good job

916
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,280
i personally would have loved underlines

917
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,839
but okay

918
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,679
so

919
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
now when we talk about the small

920
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
internet not just gopher and gemini but

921
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,639
all of it what issues does it face

922
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,040
this is more word soup from that survey

923
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,359
so a lot of people talking about

924
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,800
the drawbacks of discoverability

925
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,480
odd protocols

926
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,359
entry lack of content is a big one

927
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,839
how do we get more content on gemini one

928
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,880
of my age old complaints is

929
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,400
we need more content on gemini that's

930
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
not about gemini so if you do decide to

931
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
check it out and create yourself a

932
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,280
gemini capsule and you want to write

933
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
about stuff write about anything that's

934
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,560
not gemini we need it we want to browse

935
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,200
it we want to read it

936
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
a lot of tech people right now we would

937
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
love to see more diversity in that

938
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,320
community as well

939
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,440
it is a small community

940
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,480
but it doesn't need to be a gatekeeped

941
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,119
community we can we can be welcoming and

942
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,920
have a variety uh there is there's

943
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,680
always new and interesting stuff popping

944
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,040
up but i would love to see more and more

945
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
now the communities i i did mention them

946
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,960
a few times and i think i talked about

947
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,119
one um

948
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,480
but what

949
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
is what else is a part of the small

950
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,680
internet it's not just the protocols

951
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
themselves but it is the communities

952
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,839
where these people spend time so uh two

953
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,480
of the main ones are well it's kind of

954
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
the same thing tildes or pubnixes who

955
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,520
knows what a pubnix is

956
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
awesome okay tilde anybody heard of a

957
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,680
tilde tilde yes all right uh tildes or

958
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,320
publixes they are public access systems

959
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,480
uh that are basically like

960
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,440
you used to use 20 years ago when you

961
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,760
needed an account somewhere you

962
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
got an account on a server that somebody

963
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
ran it might have been a school might

964
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
have been a community but you got a

965
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
login usually a shell login and that's

966
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
what these are they give you a home a

967
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,839
till day

968
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,680
on the internet

969
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,440
they're run by individuals like me

970
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,480
and

971
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
usually they are free i don't know of

972
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,040
any of them that are charging currently

973
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,680
um and it's it's for fun it's for

974
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
community so some tildes are geared

975
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
toward a specific topic and they try to

976
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
attract people around a common interest

977
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,400
uh for instance there is breadpunk.com

978
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,320
which started up during covid and if you

979
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,560
have an interest in baking and baking

980
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
hacking you might check it out they are

981
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
very interesting

982
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,280
i mentioned cosmic.voyage that's the one

983
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
i write or that's the one i i've created

984
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,480
it is for sci-fi writing we have a very

985
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,000
loosely

986
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
uh shared universe where you can kind of

987
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,119
write mission logs from your own weird

988
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,280
space story and

989
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,800
see as it's relayed back to earth in old

990
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
text form communication

991
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
some tildes and some pub mixes are

992
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
general purpose and they will just

993
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
create a shell account for you and you

994
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
have access to programming tools you

995
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
have email

996
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,160
and you know for some people it it's

997
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,839
stuff that they already have but they

998
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,599
want anyway because it comes with a

999
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,440
community when you log into that system

1000
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
there are other people there

1001
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
and there are shared things you can do

1002
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,200
sometimes it's games

1003
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
uh tilde.town

1004
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,320
has a interactive graffiti wall that is

1005
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,079
a virtual graffiti wall in the terminal

1006
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,640
that is endless and if you keep panning

1007
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,960
it keeps going and it is just chock full

1008
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
of random stuff

1009
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
some of them are art projects

1010
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,280
uh some communities have put together

1011
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,640
mixed cds of their own original work

1012
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,680
but the heart of it is community

1013
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,320
you can find more about tildes at

1014
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
tildeverse.org

1015
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,440
tilde verse

1016
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,040
or just google tilde there's a bunch

1017
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,560
that'll pop up

1018
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,000
now use that

1019
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,160
and the nntp protocol

1020
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,119
using that itself uh is not in great

1021
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,960
usage ten minutes okay

1022
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
um

1023
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,359
but uh nntp the protocol behind it is

1024
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,520
getting a small resurgence in the tilde

1025
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,680
communities so if you're into that kind

1026
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,000
of forum thing you can find it there's a

1027
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,760
new version of it called nncp that is

1028
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,240
just been released anybody heard of nncp

1029
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,560
it's really impressive um yeah i don't

1030
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
have time to go into it but it deserves

1031
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
some solid looking into

1032
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
um finger

1033
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
everybody knows finger protocol

1034
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,839
finger

1035
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,359
there are whole social networks built on

1036
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
finger these days

1037
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,440
poke around

1038
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
and some parts of the fetiverse yes

1039
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,640
the super dimensional fortress i

1040
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
mentioned this is their little join page

1041
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,079
sdf.org you can join them for a free

1042
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,000
shell account get access to go for right

1043
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
away

1044
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,400
here's the tildeverse.org as well

1045
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
now

1046
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
what does the small internet solve

1047
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,599
it didn't fix surveillance capitalism

1048
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,599
but it gave us an alternative

1049
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,200
you don't have to spend all your time on

1050
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,359
facebook you can go spend

1051
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,040
greater than five percent of your time

1052
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,520
elsewhere

1053
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
it also embraces this concept that we

1054
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,800
don't need to scale to be successful

1055
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,320
you can have 350 gopher servers online

1056
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,720
and that's cool there's five million

1057
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,040
selectors there right

1058
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
go go browse you will not finish

1059
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,319
browsing go for today if you start

1060
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,560
it's deep uh and other stuff it's just

1061
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,680
fun

1062
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
so

1063
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
with that in mind i'll open up the

1064
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,960
questions any any interest we have a mic

1065
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
there we've got a few minutes

1066
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
and if you're uncomfortable

1067
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
talking there again find me at the

1068
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,839
quarantine arms i'd love to chat about

1069
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,119
it with you

1070
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,470
okay

1071
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:36,189
[Applause]

1072
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,960
and make sure to come line up uh behind

1073
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,040
these microphones in the middle go ahead

1074
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,240
i actually

1075
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,920
started a tilde version recently

1076
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,800
and got in the community about

1077
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
two or three years ago and i'm now

1078
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,560
talking to ben admin of uh today.town

1079
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,359
and today.team yes and we're starting a

1080
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,280
new tilde verse called the delta text l

1081
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,319
oh nice that's great

1082
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,520
um

1083
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,040
is anybody else on a tilde already

1084
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,960
anyone any hands

1085
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,119
one in the back all right this is good

1086
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,440
this is good um i'm sorry

1087
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
was there any other question you had

1088
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
about it you just want to share it yeah

1089
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,480
okay that's awesome thank you

1090
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,800
thanks yeah thanks for sharing um please

1091
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,000
restrict the questions uh but then also

1092
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,839
uh follow the instructions from earlier

1093
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,400
to go and spend time uh with thomas you

1094
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,359
know later

1095
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,560
great hey yeah uh

1096
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,319
the web has kind of turned you know like

1097
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,520
web 2

1098
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
obviously you know the original web was

1099
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,599
just kind of publishing stuff and then

1100
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,960
web 2 brought in the kind of the

1101
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
collaborative stuff i mean like

1102
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
obviously this is the antithesis of that

1103
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,280
but

1104
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,440
but i mean has anyone tried to to make

1105
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,800
like a chat

1106
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,920
site on

1107
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
on gopher or gemini yeah yes um

1108
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
yeah so one of the things i didn't get

1109
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,560
into a little bit there's there's an

1110
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,599
accidental feature of gemini that came

1111
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,160
out because it's line oriented and the

1112
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,240
way the spec was written it actually

1113
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
supports streaming

1114
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
um

1115
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,640
accidentally um and so if you

1116
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,400
were to do like a guy named moz did

1117
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
and create a an endpoint that just

1118
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,640
constantly feeds the contents of the

1119
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,440
chat you can connect in another tab to

1120
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
the part where you can give input to the

1121
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
chat and now you have a chat room

1122
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,280
uh so yes those exist

1123
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
uh there's gopher versions as well

1124
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,520
they're they're kind of hokey and a lot

1125
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
of them are playground experiments right

1126
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,720
now

1127
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
but one of the things

1128
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,079
the the designer of gemini dreamed about

1129
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,400
when he was musing about the protocol at

1130
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
the start was it doesn't need to just be

1131
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,280
clients that are generally browsing

1132
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
gemiini space we can create specific

1133
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,240
clients that are designed to work with

1134
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
specific endpoints

1135
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,720
to create a entire application that's

1136
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
kind of what i'm thinking yeah and

1137
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,880
absolutely do it share it i'll use it

1138
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,920
yes wait cool thank you thanks

1139
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,359
and uh is there any message over signal

1140
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,800
oh go ahead

1141
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,880
oh we have signal no oh it's checking

1142
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,839
irc i

1143
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,599
mean far as part of the conference no

1144
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
okay yeah go ahead please ask questions

1145
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,680
what kind of encryption would it use and

1146
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,520
is it vulnerable to men in the middle

1147
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,359
attacks

1148
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,680
it uses tls and currently it is

1149
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,119
vulnerable to men on the middle attacks

1150
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,680
if you are men in the middle before your

1151
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,440
first connection if you're relying on

1152
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,560
tofu

1153
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,839
now that being said tofu

1154
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,200
can

1155
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,520
avoid that if you also have tlsa in

1156
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
place if you have dns sec and you're

1157
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,680
using dane records you can validate that

1158
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
that connection is indeed who it's

1159
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,720
supposed to be

1160
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,160
with tofu

1161
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
it has not been implemented in any

1162
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,000
client yet i have it running on cosmic

1163
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,440
voyage though so if you want to build

1164
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,680
the client you can test it

1165
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,078
all right

1166
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,000
so um whole gopher and gemini they're

1167
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,480
very they're text oriented and sometimes

1168
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
it's really cool to share images yes

1169
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,200
what's the the philosophy the approach

1170
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,920
that's encouraged for images and artwork

1171
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
sharing yes there are there are a number

1172
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,880
of galleries that are on gemini um the

1173
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,359
the difficulty there is um

1174
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,680
typically in a gallery view you expect

1175
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
to see the images right

1176
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,319
but because of the one click one

1177
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,480
response nature what you'll end up with

1178
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,440
is uh links so you could post you know

1179
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
here's my photo gallery and give text

1180
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,280
descriptions of each of those and then

1181
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,920
people can then click them now some

1182
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,359
gemini clients like lagrange a very very

1183
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
very popular one

1184
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
written in sdl

1185
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,319
they choose to expand images in place in

1186
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,640
the document when you click on them so

1187
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,040
it's a just a client creative choice so

1188
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,079
a

1189
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,400
gallery looks great in there instead of

1190
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,839
clicking to a picture and then coming

1191
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,480
back you kind of expand as you go but

1192
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,079
it's it's certainly there and it needs

1193
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,800
marks for exploration of how to make it

1194
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,680
work

1195
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,760
while trying to maintain those

1196
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,000
limitations of the protocol and images

1197
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,599
are loaded through the gemini protocol

1198
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,920
yes yeah gemini does support

1199
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,079
theoretically any mime type

1200
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,880
the downside of of it is uh there is no

1201
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
file resuming and there's no compression

1202
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200
on the actual transmission so sending

1203
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,560
large files is

1204
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,920
fine if you're on a fast connection but

1205
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,720
probably not otherwise we have we we do

1206
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,599
currently have uh audio streams 24 7

1207
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,400
audio streams on gemini we do have

1208
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,640
podcasts on gemiini

1209
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,520
and there are a couple video experiments

1210
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,920
but they are not so hot

1211
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,520
but yeah you can serve anything with the

1212
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,440
mime type a lot of times what client

1213
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
authors do is if they haven't written

1214
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,880
something explicitly handle it they'll

1215
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,839
pass it off to the os

1216
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,240
thanks so we have time for just one more

1217
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,480
question if it's somewhat

1218
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
uh clear thank you

1219
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,680
client certificates is par expire so

1220
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,640
after a year or so you get a new hash

1221
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
compute in the server is there a

1222
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,920
solution for that uh right now uh right

1223
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
now the solution is the recommendation

1224
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,640
is actually to create long-lived certs

1225
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,760
unlike uh what we've been doing in uh in

1226
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
like let's encrypt with lots of changes

1227
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,480
now if you are of the type of person who

1228
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
likes to renew regularly

1229
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,760
you can do so by keeping the same key

1230
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,480
and renewing and that will update just

1231
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,839
fine

1232
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,599
if you change keys though you're going

1233
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,839
to get a warning on the client now i

1234
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,240
hope when we do see more dns sec

1235
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,119
hit

1236
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
across the internet and we can start

1237
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,839
using dane that all goes away you can

1238
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,079
change it all all the time client in

1239
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,520
couple two domain

1240
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,480
exactly

1241
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,119
yeah exactly thank you

1242
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,200
thank you everybody yeah let's let's all
