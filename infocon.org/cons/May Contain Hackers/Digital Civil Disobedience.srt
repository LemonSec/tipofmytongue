2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
thanks for being here we will talk to

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
you a bit about

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,160
digital online action and the research

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,240
that we are doing and we would like to

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,720
share it with you

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
so first some introductions

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,990
my name is marlene i

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,079
[Music]

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,840
have been involved in the activist

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
movement for about 12 years now

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,440
and been involved in different movements

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
from squatting movement to climate

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
movement feminist groups and i mean in

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
the end it's about system change it's

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
about movements that are connected

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
intersectionality if some of you know

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
so if you start with activism you end up

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
from here to there to everywhere

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,960
yeah i've been involved in different

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
social spaces i love to cook vegan food

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
um i'm a vegan myself

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
and i love to share that with people

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
um

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
yeah i'm school as a graphic designer

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,920
i've been working as a graphic designer

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,479
not for commercial work but often

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,240
for the movement and for different

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
organizations

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,240
and the last three years i am working at

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,399
greenpeace as an action coordinator

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,240
yeah so we thought for the introduction

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
it's nice to show

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
uh an image of an accent that both of us

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
have been or me in this case have been

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
involved in

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,040
and this was an action um one of my

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,479
first climbing actions at greenpeace

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
this is was me i was on a

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
on the roof of shell hq in the hague

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
where we were protesting against arctic

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,520
drilling

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
and i was sitting there for some hours

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
at some point you get arrested the

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,119
police take you down

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
so we were going through the building of

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
shell and i was wearing still this

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
big suit as a polar bear and it's

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,119
walking like really

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
big and heavy because it's big

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
and then when i came down and i took off

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
this

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
polar bear head the police was a bit

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
shocked that there was a blonde lady in

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
it and it was like the perfect picture

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,200
that the photographer took and it's

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
always nice to share

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
so

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
about martin yeah i'm martha i also work

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
at greenpeace where i started

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
after high school i did

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,959
study artificial intelligence

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
and i yeah

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
i was always talking about left active

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,319
things uh but then i got into doing some

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
privacy workshops and then i rolled into

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,000
the student movement

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
and from there it all went really fast

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
and now i'm

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
well very deep into the climate movement

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
and the nh movement

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
i sometimes play guitar but

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
yeah it's it's uh it's a process

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
and i also took a picture

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
this is instead of boss last year where

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,959
we

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,080
occupied the forest

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
um

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
yeah and in this photo i i just got on

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
foot so that was really uh

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
one of the highlights of the

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,079
one of the 12 days

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
so and yeah this is not a talk about the

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
greenpeace but uh just to give a little

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
bit of background info because uh maybe

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
not everyone knows but grievous is quite

87
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
old for the organization like the type

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
of organization that it is

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
50 years

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,280
and we're all around the world

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
and there's many officers in different

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
countries and regions

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
and we've been fighting to preserve

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
nature and for peace

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,200
for 50 years and we have a lot of

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
experience in that so we do a lot of

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
actions but we also do

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
research we go to the nature areas and

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,879
we fight court cases

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
and this is why we think we're like a

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
nuclear uniquely um

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
it makes it makes it possible for us to

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,879
try to

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,280
bring civil disobedience into the online

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
world

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
and if you know if you have

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,360
questions about greenpeace then we can

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
talk about it completely after the talk

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
if you have questions about the talk

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
itself we can do it

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,199
there's room for that still

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
yeah so

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
um

114
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
first we want to talk a bit more about

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
how we get to this topic um

116
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
so in 2014 i i was a volunteer at

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
greenpeace and i also did some

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
internship work

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
um i also came to greenpeace and said

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
like isn't it interesting to look at

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
if we can do digital actions

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
and that's already quite some time ago

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
the year after

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
i organized

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,759
a hackathon

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,320
where we where the challenge was to look

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
into the data of fishing vessels that go

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
around the whole world

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,560
and at some point they can take off

130
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
their tracking system or turn it off and

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
we basically don't know what they're

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
doing in areas so during this weekend

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
there were more than 30 people

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
we looked into the topic we got a lot of

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
data from ais systems

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
and we

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,120
learned a lot about what we can do if

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
they turn off their systems so that was

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
for greenpeace and for us a really

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
valuable moment but also for the people

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
who joined because they really liked it

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,639
to be working together with greenpeace

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,199
and to do something that would preserve

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,639
nature preserve

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
the oceans

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,280
um so after that we wanted to continue

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
with like what can we do with data with

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
online activism

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
and so together with a colleague with

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,199
bob

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
i set up an e-activist

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
team at greenpeace

153
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,280
and this is basically a team that does

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
more innocent online actions

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,639
so they write google reviews they put

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
pictures at a bad company

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
about their destruction

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
and all kinds of actions we did they

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
were very useful they were it still

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
exists this team so we're still doing

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,319
these kind of actions often to support

162
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
offline actions

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
and it's it's really a nice extra new

164
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
tool

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
in our

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,800
in our way of activism

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
so yeah next

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,560
now or the last year i've been looking

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
into like how can we do

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
digital disobedient actions

171
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
but before we really get into that we

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,120
want to give you a bit more context

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,919
about what disobedience means

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,720
but also how greenpeace does that and

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
how we

176
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
have court cases how we win court cases

177
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
because this is really important to

178
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,199
understand

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
why we believe

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,919
it could be possible

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
yeah so first about um

182
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
what is civil disobedience and

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
non-violent direct action

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
uh because there's this concept in our

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
society civil disobedience and it's

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,039
meant to

187
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
um to fight things that are greater

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,319
costs than yourself

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
and you need to

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,199
well uphold a certain number of criteria

191
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,400
in order to

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
for it to match that

193
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,039
civil disobedience definition

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
for example uh you need to have a lawful

195
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
excuse which is

196
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
um let's say your neighbor's house is on

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
fire and you break down the door or the

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,280
window to save the baby sleeping inside

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,639
then you're breaking the law because you

200
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
cannot break windows but you have a

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
lawful excuse because the

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
house is on fire and for the same way

203
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
it's like the planet is on fire so

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
sometimes it might be justified to block

205
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
shell for example

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
you have to be really careful about

207
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
safety of everyone involved that's for

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
our activists but also for the police

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
people and for the workers at the sites

210
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
that you do actions at

211
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,800
um and you have to

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
subsidiarity is when you

213
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
um first exhaust all other possible

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
means to fight for your uh cause so

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,879
if you

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
start with petitions and then you do

217
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
demonstrations and it still doesn't work

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
then that might then you

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
almost have to uh take the next step

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
then you're justified for that but you

221
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
also have to be proportional so

222
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,679
if you're uh fighting a very big thing

223
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,080
then um it's it's um proportional to for

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
example with the statables

225
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,640
uh we have a big nature crisis going on

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
and then you sleep in in a tree in the

227
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
forest that's that's a small thing

228
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
let's see if i forgot anything with

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
greenpeace we're very and also for civil

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
disobedience uh non-violent so

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,320
violence is a very vague concept

232
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,399
um but we're very strict never violence

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,040
against people and if you have to do

234
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
violence against objects

235
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
objects rather not

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
but sometimes you need to maybe

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,920
break through a fence or for example but

238
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
non-violent as much as possible and as i

239
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
said there's no personal gain to be had

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
from doing civil disobedience

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,279
so it's really for the bigger cause and

242
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
all this together

243
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
makes it so that judges think like okay

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,560
this is

245
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,360
they're

246
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
changing the world they're fighting for

247
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
bigger calls and that's nice and nvda is

248
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
a

249
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
subset of civil disobedience where you

250
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
directly go to the

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,800
um to the activity that's that's doing

252
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
harm for example

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
you shut down the coal fired power

254
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,040
station it's a direct action and you

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,760
directly stop the activity

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,399
and so one example

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,600
um

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
i can just play right yeah yeah this is

259
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
in germany

260
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
sound

261
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
it would be nice if there are sounds

262
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
so every year there are big actions in

263
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,320
germany called endigalenda and they are

264
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,640
really nice example of

265
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
people power people doing action to stop

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,720
uh fossil fuel industry in this case

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,839
lignite

268
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,160
mining

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,200
and they're very

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,160
profound with the whole terrain

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
a thousand to 1500 have come from all

272
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
over europe we're here to stop the

273
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
trains from coming across the tracks

274
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,680
because we believe in climate justice

275
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,959
and we want the coal to stay in the

276
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
ground

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
i feel it's an honor to be here so

278
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,510
yeah i'm uh i'm very happy

279
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,040
[Music]

280
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,160
we know that you're lying

281
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,740
[Music]

282
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
we need to act in every way we can and

283
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
civil disobedience is one of this

284
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
whatever it takes we have to stop gold

285
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
the people got the power

286
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
tell me can you feel it

287
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
um

288
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
so yeah that's that's pretty nice where

289
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
thousands of people come together and if

290
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
you want you can go again this uh summer

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,399
they're organizing in august in august

292
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,959
another example this is amsterdam

293
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,600
it's a really nice field of grass in the

294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
city center

295
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
but what i didn't know at least is that

296
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,839
it used to be a

297
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,279
highway uh right through the through

298
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,399
amsterdam

299
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
and people really didn't like this

300
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,399
actually because they really didn't like

301
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
cars um and they thought yeah we just

302
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
should take the bike so they got on the

303
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
highway they did like a die-in

304
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
and they took their bikes as you can see

305
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,800
and this is civil disobedience that

306
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
changed the highway

307
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,600
to

308
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
a nice field of grass

309
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,120
and i think that's

310
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
an important part

311
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
of civil disobedience it has shaped the

312
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
world around us for

313
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
the better

314
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
from the same plane to voting rights for

315
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
women

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
to the eight hour work day to abortion

317
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,519
rights um it has shaped the world around

318
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,040
us so

319
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,160
um we think it's important

320
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
yes so um

321
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
now uh we would like to talk a bit about

322
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,920
how we do these actions at greenpeace

323
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
like martha said greenpeace has been

324
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
doing actions for around the world for

325
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
more than for 50 years now

326
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
and there's a lot of experience and

327
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
knowledge here in the netherlands but

328
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
also in of course many other places in

329
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
the world

330
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,600
so when preparing an action at

331
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
greenpeace um that's my work

332
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
uh basically every detail counts so the

333
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
moment we depart from our warehouse till

334
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,639
the second we go onto a

335
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,920
gas rig as we see here in the picture

336
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
that we already prepare what happens if

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
we get a court case we already do

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
everything in advance we know everything

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
that could possibly go wrong or what

340
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,399
could happen

341
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
and that's super important to be

342
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360
prepared especially in court

343
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
so

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
what happened in this case i'm going to

345
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,440
take you to one action that happened in

346
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,120
2018 because it's just a very

347
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
interesting example

348
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
so

349
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
there was a company called hansa and

350
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,639
they were planning to

351
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
start drilling for

352
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
gas

353
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,000
in srimanuk oh uh in the valley which is

354
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
a nature area even a nature 2000 area

355
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
the dutch government has been working

356
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
for years on it to get it flourished as

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
a nature reserve and then suddenly

358
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
there's this company saying so we're

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
going to get some gas there it's going

360
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
to destroy the nature

361
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
besides destroying nature the people who

362
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
live there they didn't want any of this

363
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
happening in their backyards they didn't

364
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
want anything of this happening in this

365
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
beautiful nature reserve

366
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,720
so

367
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,199
the people they contacted greenpeace

368
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
beforehand greenpeace was already in

369
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
touch with hansa the company that was

370
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
planning to drill for the gas

371
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
to say hey if you're going to do

372
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
something let us know they said okay we

373
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,320
will let you know if we're going to

374
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,160
start drilling because

375
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,279
we need to

376
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
tell that in advance

377
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
because we're preparing it because the

378
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
government needs to know that's how it

379
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,440
works but they didn't they just

380
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
announced we're gonna start drilling

381
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
next week

382
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,399
so in a week time greenpeace prepared

383
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
this action often we take months to

384
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,959
prepare but here was one week

385
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
where we took off from amsterdam all the

386
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
way to sri lanka

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
and in preparation of this action like i

388
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
said we think about every single detail

389
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
so we think

390
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,440
how are about

391
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
going to contact

392
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
the owner hansa but also we need to

393
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
contact the authorities that we're doing

394
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
an action

395
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
so when you're doing an action in the

396
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
area of oil rig this is important for

397
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,800
the legal case after

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
there is a mining law and this means you

399
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,759
cannot be in the area of this mining

400
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,399
activity in 500 meters

401
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
so we had to stay out of this 500 meters

402
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,839
and that's what we did with our big ship

403
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
we had a beluga with us it's a sailing

404
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,360
vessel

405
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
and it was outside of this 500 meter

406
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
border

407
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,199
but we had also had our ribs with us

408
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
and those could go into this 500 meter

409
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
area because

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
the rig is supplied

411
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,920
also with small ribs

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,360
that there's no danger of any anything

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
collapsing into the rig

414
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
so we knew that and that's why we took

415
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
the ribs to bring it to bring the

416
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,120
activists to the rig

417
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
and what also happened at the same time

418
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
is the moment we start this action we

419
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
called the owner we called the

420
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
authorities we're going to do an action

421
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,560
we weren't even on the rig yet but we

422
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
prevented

423
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,680
already that in the court case they

424
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,000
would say you're there was dangerous we

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
didn't know we were planning to mine

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
blah blah blah blah blah so we already

427
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
knew we need to let them know in advance

428
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
and we are so fast that they are unable

429
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,639
to stop us

430
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
before we're already on the rig before

431
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
they're there so

432
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
this is very important in the legal

433
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,440
process

434
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
so here the activists go on to the rib

435
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
they go into the onto the

436
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
the rig

437
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,279
after 24 hours the activists were taken

438
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
off the oil rig

439
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
and that already

440
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
took care of a lot of media attention

441
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,079
and it made the discussion really start

442
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
in the netherlands about drilling for

443
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
gas

444
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
in a nature reserve

445
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
so that's basically the goal

446
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
for that action and it really worked

447
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
but then after

448
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,280
there was always the public prosecutor

449
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
saying hey i want to have those

450
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,640
activists

451
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
being punished because they did

452
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,039
something that is not allowed

453
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
so what the public persecutor said is

454
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
that the mining law is more important

455
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,360
than the right to protest

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
that the action was totally unsafe and

457
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
that there are less invasive ways of

458
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
making your point so they say we

459
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
shouldn't have gone on to the rig we

460
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
should have just talked to them but of

461
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,559
course it doesn't that doesn't work

462
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,280
um this is a lot of text but it's a it's

463
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
just very interesting this is

464
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
what the this is the verdict of the

465
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
judge in the end all the charges were

466
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
dropped the judge the judges basically

467
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,280
said

468
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
that the right to protest is more

469
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,280
important than the mining law which is

470
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
already really exceptional that's really

471
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
really quite amazing that they said that

472
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
because often

473
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,679
economy and money goes before

474
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,520
ideological and activism

475
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
but what they also said and here i wrote

476
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,880
it down a bit more concise

477
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,000
is that again that the mining law is not

478
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
absolute it's

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,919
the right to protest is more important

480
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,240
the mining company started to test

481
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
unexpected

482
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
that's why greenpeace couldn't do

483
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
anything else

484
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
to had like we said the subsidiarity so

485
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,360
we couldn't get into touch with them

486
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,520
they were just on their way and we were

487
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
too late to basically go into a

488
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
discussion

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
there was no safety risk so this is all

490
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
what the judge said

491
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
the action was well prepared and well

492
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,919
documented

493
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
and they even said greenpeace was a

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,240
large and professional organization that

495
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,679
should really address these kind of

496
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
topics

497
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
there was open communication with the

498
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,960
authorities um the action was limited

499
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
um yeah they had a clear target

500
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
so in the end it was also for us it was

501
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,960
really special that they really set this

502
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
mining law aside and they said the right

503
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
to protest is more important and that

504
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
was really a big victory

505
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,640
so again in this like i said essential

506
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,919
is the subsidiarity and the

507
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
proportionality because that's where the

508
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,799
judge

509
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
really looks at

510
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,200
so why i'm telling all of this is

511
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
because basically what we're doing

512
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
is if you think about it like if i'm

513
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,799
myself if i just go take a boat and i'm

514
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,799
gonna row to a rick and i'm gonna climb

515
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,000
on it

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
i will probably be prosecuted i will

517
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,559
probably get a fine or jail time because

518
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,760
it's so

519
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
unclear what i'm doing there i'm one

520
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,080
person they don't understand it but if

521
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,120
you're doing that with a big

522
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
organization if you have a clear story

523
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
and if you have a clear goal it can

524
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,760
change

525
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000
so the question now is the one i wrote

526
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,360
down here

527
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,159
anyhow so when we talk about digital

528
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
action digital disobedient action

529
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
um we think

530
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
digital action equals high fines and

531
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,880
jail time

532
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
because that's basically what you hear a

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
lot when people do something online

534
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,880
that's not allowed that there are a lot

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
of media attention and that people get

536
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
high fines if they are found because

537
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
often you're anonymous

538
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
um yeah

539
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,799
if it works let me know um

540
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,600
yeah so the last year year and a half

541
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,159
we've been doing really extensive uh

542
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,360
research um where we talked to

543
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,840
lawyers who are specialized in the right

544
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
to protest

545
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,000
but also um as cyber uh cyber crime

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,039
lawyers

547
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,760
um who have advised us and we have been

548
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
talking about like how

549
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
does that work and how do you

550
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,840
could you move like right to protest the

551
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,480
european right into a digital area and

552
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,799
they say it's it should be possible it

553
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,840
should be it's very interesting to quest

554
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
ask this question because it hasn't been

555
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,480
done

556
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
like this before

557
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
of course we know actions that are done

558
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,559
anonymously by example anonymous um but

559
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
no one knows who they are but if you

560
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
would do a digital action and say hey

561
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
we're greenpeace we've done that and we

562
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
are standing for what we're doing and we

563
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,799
can explain to you how we did it and how

564
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,360
and what we've done and why we did it

565
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
like copy what we did what we do offline

566
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
and we often win and we always windows

567
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
court cases

568
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
offline

569
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
how come you can't copy that to an

570
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,480
online place

571
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
so again we said

572
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
we're still researching we want to know

573
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
everything about this

574
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
if we can't guarantee safety if we can't

575
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
guarantee the safety of the activists of

576
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
of

577
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
of anyone who's involved of even the

578
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200
companies that we might hack

579
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,290
then we won't do it

580
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,120
[Music]

581
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,679
so basically what i'm saying is that

582
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,520
i or we think that the risk isn't as

583
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,559
high as i expected before

584
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
there are laws already made on this

585
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
topic cybercrime crime and we've seen

586
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,559
that of course in the news

587
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
but there's also part in this law that

588
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
talks about ideological action

589
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,760
so that means that there's already a

590
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,320
chapter a chapter written

591
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,480
uh in its web book from

592
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,400
i don't know how to say that in english

593
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,080
um

594
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
saying that it's

595
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
they already thought about like what if

596
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,679
you hack something with an ideological

597
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
stance with an ideological view and then

598
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
of course we look into a jurisprudence

599
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
so what has been done before have there

600
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
been court cases

601
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,520
done against activists who do digital

602
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
actions

603
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
and of course we look at the european

604
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
context you can can look into many

605
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
places in the world u.s and there's

606
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
often these can things happen with um

607
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,159
snowden and but we're in europe so we

608
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
look at european law

609
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
and one action we did find was

610
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
a ddos attack on lyft hansa

611
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
done by activists who didn't want

612
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
undocumented refugees to be deported

613
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
and lufthansa was taking them and taking

614
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
them to another location

615
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
so they did us

616
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,120
openly hey we did this this is my name

617
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,600
as a form of demonstration

618
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
and they won this court case

619
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,880
so they were not prosecuted for anything

620
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,200
and that's the one case we can find in

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
it was in germany

622
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
uh that happened where activists said we

623
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,320
did this

624
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
it was a direct action

625
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
um

626
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
but the judge said

627
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
it is it is okay to do it because it was

628
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
a demonstration and that's really

629
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,520
interesting

630
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
yeah so screens are not on yet

631
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,159
um

632
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
so if we really want to start with doing

633
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
actions we really need to prepare

634
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,360
um because how would you copy these

635
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
the things we prepare

636
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
when we do a physical actions for online

637
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,679
action

638
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,080
like we say the subsidiarity

639
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,799
and proportionality

640
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,240
proportionarity melody are very

641
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,360
important

642
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,840
and subsidiarity depends on the target

643
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
hey

644
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,919
yes

645
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,080
that talks a bit easier because it's a

646
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,960
lot of text um

647
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,640
yeah so the subsidiaries it depends on

648
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
the target so for example if we want to

649
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
do a digital action on shell

650
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,039
um i mean we have we've got a history

651
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
with shell we've done many actions on

652
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,200
shell so we don't really need to explain

653
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
why we're doing more heavy actions for

654
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
example or digital actions on shell

655
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
because we have been doing that for

656
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
years

657
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
um so that depends on the target but if

658
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
you want to do a proportional action

659
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,799
that's a bit of a difficult one that's

660
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
something that we that i've been

661
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
thinking about like what is a small

662
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,679
action online what is something big what

663
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,279
is something that's really disruptive

664
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,600
and how would a judge look at that

665
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,480
um and how can we track every every step

666
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
we take online so for example if we

667
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,840
climb a building you can basically say

668
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
yeah we went through the advance then we

669
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
went there we went take that ladder and

670
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
we're up the building but how would you

671
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,559
do that online how can you track that

672
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,240
how can you show that you haven't been

673
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
looking into places where you find

674
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,880
credit card data or anything else

675
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
yeah so again the thorough legal advice

676
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,120
we don't want any risks

677
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
we want to make sure that no one gets in

678
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,400
jail

679
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
and if they are not possible then we

680
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
don't do it

681
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
uh also something i was thinking about

682
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
can someone

683
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,679
experienced

684
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
an experienced hacker prepare an action

685
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
and that a greenpeace prominent for

686
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
example the director presses a button

687
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,559
and he does it he does the hack

688
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,159
because that you know in this in the

689
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,799
discussion that could really help

690
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,279
um and as always a risk assessment

691
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
yeah so

692
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
now we're uh in the process of um

693
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,559
well all the technical stuff but it's

694
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,720
also

695
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,640
what are we actually going to do um we

696
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
are very good at

697
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,200
doing banner drops but what would the

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
digital banner drop look like

699
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,200
and

700
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
it's quite obvious if you block the

701
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
entrance to a shell

702
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,279
but can we also do a direct action

703
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
online and how would it look like

704
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,080
and

705
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,279
maybe the

706
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,840
most interesting one uh or challenging

707
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,679
one at least is the mass action where

708
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,000
you have uh you saw the video of andy

709
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
glenn with thousands of people can we do

710
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,080
it online in a disruptive manner

711
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
and then

712
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
yeah make it make it happen

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
because

714
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,120
the

715
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
world is warming

716
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,360
and nowadays um

717
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,559
you have

718
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,840
this is

719
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
from the global south but on the right

720
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
side of the screen it's it's in europe

721
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
now and even in the netherlands where we

722
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,720
have floods

723
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,480
so there's no

724
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,200
escaping it anymore and something uh

725
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
needs to be done

726
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,120
and then

727
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,799
where the question part

728
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,679
how much time do we have 15 okay

729
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,399
so we have time for questions um and we

730
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,640
would love to hear anything if you have

731
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,799
any remarks or questions or

732
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,440
uh also uh later we have more time you

733
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,960
can also come to us we will be here the

734
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
whole day also on monday so

735
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
any questions

736
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,120
oh yeah

737
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,760
it's this oh yeah it's also working like

738
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
what you described is how can you prove

739
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,679
that you're not hacking the company or

740
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,840
not accessing the database or accessing

741
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
confidential information can you talk a

742
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,279
bit closer i can yeah of course yeah

743
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
the most important thing with it is like

744
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,679
what you described with a ddos attack

745
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,799
it's impossible to hack anything with it

746
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,320
it's just

747
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
disrupting their services but it's not

748
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,039
hacking it you're not accessing the

749
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,440
database you can prove this to everyone

750
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
that there are certain types of cyber

751
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
attacks which

752
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,039
which are impossible to

753
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,200
lead to an actionable hack

754
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
and that's the most powerful thing of it

755
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
also what you said like how can i have

756
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,880
many people

757
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
attack shell for example like take the

758
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,720
most

759
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,799
busy page of cell the the page which

760
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
takes the most time to load maybe their

761
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,520
login page to their oil platform or take

762
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
some page which is very slow to load and

763
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,399
speak a time

764
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
globally and everyone refresh the page

765
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,559
constantly everyone everyone at the team

766
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,200
start refreshing the page and eventually

767
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
it will stop working and then the oil

768
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
consumers cannot log in but you can

769
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,159
prove that you did not hack anything

770
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,440
and if you um say like hey we're green

771
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
priests we're gonna we're gonna use uh

772
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,360
we're gonna like

773
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,880
if you're gonna do a real hack you must

774
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,640
say i'm gonna use it from this ip

775
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,159
address i'm gonna use this method and

776
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,240
you can check this logs to make sure

777
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,919
that no database has been hacked but if

778
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
you're using a ddos attack you should

779
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,960
not disclose your ip because then they

780
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
can block it very easily but it's

781
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
technically impossible to

782
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,279
to access private information so you're

783
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,320
always

784
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,279
in that

785
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,880
site legal

786
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,200
right nice is not legal by the way but

787
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,919
it's

788
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,240
at least a gray area yeah

789
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
nice thanks it's very interesting

790
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
yeah

791
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
can we respond because uh on monday we

792
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,919
have

793
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,640
a workshop where we're gonna try to

794
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,880
really make the translation move for

795
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,720
this kind of actions

796
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,200
and really try to look like okay maybe

797
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
we can even find the page that you were

798
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,880
talking about and let's let's find it on

799
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,630
monday

800
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,699
[Music]

801
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,799
[Applause]

802
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
now with the slides can you make them

803
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
available online with download and with

804
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,399
for instance all the cases you've

805
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,440
mentioned

806
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,000
could you cite them and like tweet them

807
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
or mastered on them or something that

808
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,640
would be nice

809
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
is there a way we can see yeah i think

810
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,880
so can you tell us now we can also

811
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
discuss with the organization how or

812
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,880
where we can share it that should be

813
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,679
fine cool thank you

814
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
i have one remark and one question a

815
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,799
remark for the gentleman about ddosing

816
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,720
the website it will not work

817
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
i've been working in marketing for 10

818
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
years and i know how these sites are

819
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,279
being built up

820
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,080
so

821
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
best case you would get one edge note

822
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,240
you could maybe get down but everything

823
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,120
is protected by like cdn or akamai or

824
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,880
without any real

825
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,679
hacking you would just not get a result

826
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,519
that's that's that you would like but i

827
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,279
would like to talk more on monday about

828
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,480
that

829
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,799
yes yeah

830
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,840
but

831
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,519
let's talk about let's go or after this

832
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,120
talk also

833
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,039
my my question is um if if you do an

834
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,279
action who gets sued is that greenpeace

835
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,880
or are there people performing the

836
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,919
action

837
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,480
if greenpeace acts as a protection for

838
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
people doing the action that could

839
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
attract a lot more people be willing to

840
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,679
do civil uh disobedience if they're

841
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
shielded by an organization

842
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,279
yeah it's uh

843
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,559
actually all

844
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,640
i think almost all cases it's the

845
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,080
activists

846
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,960
um and but it's also a combination

847
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,760
because

848
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
the the activists do the action in the

849
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
name to have for together with

850
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
greenpeace

851
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
so that means that they have an

852
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,399
organization like greenpeace behind them

853
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,240
supporting them also being there in

854
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
court um

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,600
with the lawyers um

856
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,080
so it's greenpeace supporting them and

857
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
greenpeace helping running the the court

858
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,360
cases

859
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
uh but in the end they want to uh

860
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,640
prosecute the activists okay um but we

861
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,120
yeah we don't have any um cases where

862
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,960
the activists were heavenly uh

863
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,840
prosecutors because of those

864
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,039
preparations and that's where it starts

865
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,279
it starts when we are at home in our

866
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,840
drawing tables drawing down this action

867
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,519
or at work

868
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,679
and saying hey we really need to take

869
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,000
care of all these points because of a

870
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
court case

871
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,719
that's already prepared in advance

872
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,039
hey so first of all cool talk thanks for

873
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,120
sharing um i do have a question

874
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,559
regarding this preparation phase that

875
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,320
you mentioned um

876
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
i would expect it's kind of easy when

877
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,440
you're a dutch person doing something on

878
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,000
dutch mainland like taking an action but

879
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
then when it gets online it gets much

880
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
more difficult to grasp how do you make

881
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
sure that it's actually dutch law that

882
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,840
will be avail that will be applicable

883
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,360
how do you make sure that you know do

884
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,840
not fall under like for ranger addiction

885
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,880
and is it part of the technical analysis

886
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,760
that uh that you have to conduct before

887
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,799
taking such actions or is it part of

888
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,240
like a more legal approach

889
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
uh for the first question um i think you

890
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
mentioned i mean you mean that if you

891
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
hack a company that has servers in the

892
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,039
us for example yeah sometimes you just

893
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,279
don't know you may have some hkcs where

894
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,279
it has some impact on other companies on

895
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,080
other

896
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
jurisdictions for example yeah yeah we

897
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,799
we also talked about that with the cyber

898
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,519
crime lawyer for example and he said

899
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,519
that's a very difficult one of course

900
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
and you know if you would start doing

901
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,240
these actions it would be smart to look

902
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,120
into where are servers placed for the

903
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,679
first times and see you know

904
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,840
to make sure you're on european area or

905
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,519
european law

906
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,200
and if not

907
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
that's the next step i would say because

908
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
there is a chance that the us will say

909
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,039
hey the activists need to come here

910
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,880
because we want to prosecute them and

911
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,840
that's a very tricky one but

912
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,080
[Music]

913
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
i i think what we said now we would try

914
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,600
to focus on european law and everything

915
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,679
that's on european ground

916
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,040
okay cool thank you and the second

917
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,679
question uh sorry i i missed i'm not

918
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,359
sure there was a second question okay

919
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,040
sorry i thought you had a second one

920
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,839
sorry

921
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,000
yeah hello hey

922
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,599
um

923
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,599
think about that formulated uh properly

924
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,320
so

925
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
there's of course the tension between uh

926
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,679
if you do something in public it's nice

927
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
but then people know who you are and we

928
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,199
know that maybe sometimes uh

929
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,480
like people

930
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
that don't necessarily follow the law

931
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,560
people disappear or stuff like this

932
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
um

933
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
i don't know if you could maybe comment

934
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,639
on the difference between like doing

935
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,440
something privately or like

936
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
securely let's say so you don't know

937
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
who's behind it so nobody can be

938
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
specifically targeted

939
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,040
because usually it's just

940
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,320
a few people that know the very

941
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,960
specifics and so like you just make

942
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
their life horrible and there won't be

943
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
more of these attacks let's say so i

944
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,359
think there's a bit of a tension between

945
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,599
like doing something privately or like

946
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,480
uh anonymously versus publicly i don't

947
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
know if you thought about this it was

948
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,000
partially on answered a little bit by

949
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,960
the preparation stage yeah

950
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,400
i think it's probably best to do

951
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,880
everything out in the open uh

952
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,160
as let's say in the light as possible

953
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
yeah but yeah maybe you can comment on

954
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,760
this

955
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,440
yeah we we

956
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,480
we're still talking about this but um

957
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,800
like i said before

958
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
um

959
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,599
this form of action like what we're

960
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,000
doing offline

961
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,839
we can get away with it like we do it

962
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,160
for 50 years

963
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,680
and i believe you can really copy that

964
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
to an online place and if you do it

965
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
anonymously online

966
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,640
i think if they find you in the end

967
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
i think the repercussions are harder and

968
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,800
are

969
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
because we're open and because

970
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
greenpeace is always saying this is the

971
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,800
activist this is the organization the

972
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,599
judge is also more willing to be

973
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
hey that you're doing it for such a nice

974
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,760
such an important topic you're fighting

975
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,320
climate change or whatever

976
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,160
it really helps

977
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
so i i know what you're saying that

978
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,839
there's like not maybe not so many

979
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,440
people who can do a really difficult

980
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,920
hack for example uh maybe there are i

981
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
don't know or or even activists like

982
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
fighting for the amazon i don't know

983
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
what is like the highest number of

984
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
activists despair over there

985
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
yeah no that's true but that also it

986
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,000
depends on what action you're also doing

987
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,880
right and what what target and but with

988
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
greenpeace it's it's really like that

989
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,839
that we always show who we are

990
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
but we do

991
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,119
i personally think it's important that

992
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,359
you can do anonymous actions of course

993
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,599
but that's not how greenpeace

994
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,880
works

995
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,880
thanks

996
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,520
okay so the last two questions and then

997
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
we need to continue

998
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,480
so uh

999
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,119
to me it feels that the goal with the

1000
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
physical protest is to disrupt the

1001
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
companies to get their attention

1002
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,839
for a cause right

1003
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,520
yeah

1004
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,359
on monday we're going to go into

1005
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,440
four tactics and sometimes it's also

1006
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,359
making public aware that something is

1007
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,520
happening or direct communications

1008
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,359
towards the people who can influence

1009
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,599
decisions uh

1010
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,800
but we now we focused a lot on yeah

1011
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,560
yeah because the examples given people

1012
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
boarding a drilling platform

1013
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
you being in the trees all that is

1014
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
preventing people

1015
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,079
their work right you're being disruptive

1016
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,040
to that process it custom money

1017
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,119
time effort whatever

1018
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,760
if you translate that to online

1019
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,359
you will not accomplish that with a

1020
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
wikileaks or ever snowden

1021
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,359
you will not get there if you go with

1022
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,760
the ddos you won't get there so

1023
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,040
that means that you're you're promoting

1024
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,760
to

1025
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,359
destroy

1026
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
or disrupt their infrastructure

1027
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
and you feel that you can do that with

1028
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
your previous

1029
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,040
offline case in the physical space so is

1030
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,359
that what you're advocating

1031
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,800
no

1032
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,079
this is what we

1033
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
want to dive into on monday to see like

1034
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
hey

1035
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
if we do a better drop can we do a

1036
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
better drop online like i said is it is

1037
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,240
it translation that's called spam

1038
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,040
i don't know i i think that um

1039
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,400
i think that there's a lot of creative

1040
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,839
people maybe here maybe on the camp

1041
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,920
maybe in the world who can translate it

1042
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,599
into different things maybe it's true

1043
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,200
what you're saying maybe it's one of the

1044
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
tactics but i think that also civil

1045
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,079
disobedience comes in many ways right so

1046
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
i think there's ways to

1047
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,400
we have to hurry up

1048
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,560
to look into that yeah

1049
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
destroying things is not non-violent and

1050
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
it's also not civil disobedience more

1051
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
sabotage well

1052
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
and that's the point you made so so i'm

1053
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,720
i guess confused the room you give

1054
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
yourself what you are able to do so

1055
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
online yeah yeah

1056
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,240
digital processes which i get yeah but i

1057
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
think it's hard to accomplish with the

1058
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,720
rules you give yourself yeah but it's

1059
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
it's not easy yes

1060
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,799
thanks

1061
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,440
hi have you heard of the activist group

1062
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,119
distributed denial of secrets and some

1063
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,640
of the environmental datasets that they

1064
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
released like mining secrets

1065
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,000
no no but that's a good tip okay we um

1066
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,839
maybe later you can say it again after

1067
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
the talk and we can write it down yeah

1068
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
okay we have two more minutes

1069
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
one minute okay so

1070
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,359
uh attempt to check erase your hand if

1071
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,040
you agree with the statement and yeah

1072
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
it's okay if you disagree but just to

1073
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
get a feel of the room

1074
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,720
what oh one question uh um can we first

1075
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
do this please and then we can do it

1076
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,520
afterwards

1077
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,240
um directed to the action should be

1078
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,240
normalized like offline direct actions

1079
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,079
nice that's also why you came to the

1080
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,480
talk maybe

1081
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,359
so

1082
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,160
what's next um we're

1083
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
we're going to continue with the legal

1084
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
research and we're going to do it out in

1085
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,720
the open so we will

1086
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,599
publish the position paper and we will

1087
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,839
host public

1088
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,640
events and

1089
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,000
then we're going to set up a team of

1090
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,480
people who can actually do this stuff

1091
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
and

1092
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,280
we're going to design the first low risk

1093
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
action so we're not just going to

1094
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
encrypt all the surface of some

1095
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
oil company

1096
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,200
maybe we're going to start with easy

1097
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
we are going to start at easy

1098
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
and then on monday where like we said

1099
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,079
we're going to try to really see if we

1100
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,200
can find

1101
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,560
ways to make this translation step

1102
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,319
but hopefully all of y'all and your

1103
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,680
expertise

1104
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,359

1105
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,520
