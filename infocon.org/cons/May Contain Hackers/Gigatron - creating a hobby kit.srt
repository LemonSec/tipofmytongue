[Music]

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,279
this talk will be about the gigatron but

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,279
i will not really be focusing on the

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,439
workings of it by the way

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,240
this is a gigatron computer so i will

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,840
not go into the very

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
nitty gritty details there's existing

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
talks that i did before that you can

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,519
find on the internet

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
i will briefly discuss what it is and

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
then i will go into the process of

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,600
making a kit to help people who might

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
also be interested in making and selling

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
them their own electronics

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,280
do-it-yourself kit

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
so it's about the lessons that we

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
learned in the gigaton project by the

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,879
way is there anybody who here has heard

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,280
of the gigantron

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,360
quite a few not everybody who has a

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
gigatron to build it

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
very good very good

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
so first a little bit about the history

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
how it came about a short introduction

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,879
and then i'll go into the whole kit

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
making process

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
actually there's plenty of kids out

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,680
there

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
and uh

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,080
am i still holdable yeah they're fun to

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
uh to make they're fun to use um and for

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,520
some people that's where it ends i mean

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
you can you can have enough fun just

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
getting such a kit uh building it and

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
tinkering with it that's perfectly fine

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,119
if that's satisfying enough for you no

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,079
problem

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,560
but this talk will be about creating a

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
new kit that didn't exist before

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,439
it all started a few years ago in the

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,759
end of 2016

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
and not by me but by marcel van kervink

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
a friend of mine who sadly passed away

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,920
two years ago and he bought some ttl

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
ics chips that you can see here a

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
soldering iron an oscilloscope and a big

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,360
book about discrete logic and he thought

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
let's do a

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
an interesting project

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
and i joined the project six months

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
later which i will explain further on

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
muscle's first object objective was well

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
really to as a hacker to learn and have

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
fun with electronics and he's thought

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,800
well let's build a cpu so he had this

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
bunch of

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
7400 series ttl chips which are chips

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
that are really basic building blocks

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
like and or nor stuff

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
and he said well let's let's build a cpu

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
and that's something that a lot of

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
people have done already on the internet

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,239
there's a

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
cpu web ring that where you can go to

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,160
all the websites of the people making

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
such

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,120
cpus so and the goal was not to to be

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
useful or make really something that

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
other people could use it was just a

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
learning project

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
and the inspiration throughout the

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
project was a very big inspiration was

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
ben either ben either has this wonderful

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
series on youtube about cpu design and

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,560
he uses breadboarding and he he builds a

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
computer from from the tiny beginnings

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
to a whole 8-bit computer he's created

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
this this red board computer and that

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,239
was an inspiration also it shows that

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
you can actually do this

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
and uh and i will go into this in a

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
little bit also the quark 85 which is a

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
well just an 80 tiny 85 that bit bangs a

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
video signal out of it vga signal was

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
also an inspiration that was a key

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
factor in defining what the gigatron was

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
supposed to become

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
it started with

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,080
this system

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
in

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,120
early 2019 and this is a 4-bit cpu so

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
this was marcel's first

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
attempt at building his own cpu

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
and

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,519
there's a big chip on there that's an

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
alu an algorithmic logic unit

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
and a few other components but actually

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
it it failed kind of miserably

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
and

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,280
after january 19 came this quark 85

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
and this inspired marcel to think

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
can i also do some vga bit banging that

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
would be mighty interesting because the

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
idea at first was to make a simple cpu

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
that could flash some lights or

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
tic-tac-toe but this bit banging was

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
interesting so we built the thing on the

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,239
top right which

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,519
is a

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
system that with simple logic

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,478
takes an image out of rom

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,279
and

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
puts it out on vga

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
so it's just like the quark 85 but not

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
using an 80 tiny but using very simple

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
electronics and that worked so that was

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
the first step

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
and then

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,199
out of that

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
he proceeded to

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,919
not use rom but use ram because in the

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,360
end you don't want to have a static

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
image from rom you want to be able to

124
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
change the image so on the bottom right

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
there were ram chips which he had to

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,320
load using

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
a microprocessor

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
an external board that you can see on

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
the web board as well

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,160
and then after a lot of work in june

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
2017 there was the uh

132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
yeah the prototype of the gigatron so

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,039
this was the first working breadboard

134
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,320
version

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
of the gigatron and that was the the

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
main proof of concept what's interesting

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
is that you can actually

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
have a look at this project because it's

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
in the home computer museum of

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
performance

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
and so if you go to helmund you can go

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,080
around this fabulous computer museum

143
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
play with all the computers and also

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
have a look at this breadboard system

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
that's over there

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
which i'm quite proud of that it's in a

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
as an actual museum

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
now the gigaton rules

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,000
that were made during the process were

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
we want to have a cpu that has no

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
complex logic at all it should be all

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
really simple stuff like stuff that you

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,199
could buy in the

154
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
80s or 70s even

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
so no alu this this big honking chip

156
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
that does all kinds of arithmetic no

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,759
it's not in the gigatron that's done

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
with

159
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
simpler components

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,400
it should be a single board computer

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
with about 30 for the chip count and

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
that was inspired by steve wozniak steve

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
wozniak his first job at atahiri was to

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
build a breakout

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
no sorry there was a breakout game

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,280
console gonzole uh arcade and he was

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
asked by steve jobs to reduce the chip

168
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
count it was like a hundred and he was

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
able to reduce it to uh

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
i don't know 30 something in the end

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
product it was like 40 chips

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,280
and it was really a big achievement of

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
steve wozniak to to make such a

174
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
interesting system with such little

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
amount of such a small amount of chips

176
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
but we still wanted to do something

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,479
useful

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
and have a nice look and and yeah built

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
with people but if you want to build

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
something uh that's interesting uh

181
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,199
as i said you can just buy an existing

182
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
project and if you do it yourself it

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
would be nice if you build something

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
that stands out that you that you make

185
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
something unique

186
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
so that was also uh

187
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
something that was was in this kit it

188
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
needs to have something that others

189
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,919
don't have

190
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,479
so find a niche and by having this

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,599
system

192
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
which is actually a cpu combined video

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
card

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
makes it makes it a unique system

195
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
a lesson in the process up to the

196
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
prototype board was

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
so make it niche

198
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,599
do something that others haven't done

199
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
before of course you build on the work

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
of others you stand on top of the other

201
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
work

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
but find a niche and also it helps the

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
document so marcel started documenting

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,960
this from the the second board that you

205
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
saw in the previous slide on hackaday.io

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
and that is really helpful because other

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
people that might also be interested

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
will

209
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
spark more motivation than you two to go

210
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
further

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
okay so that's about the

212
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
the the prototyping stage so that took

213
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,000
quite a while we had a prototype

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
and then

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,919
some people said

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,840
well you know that's interesting why

217
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
don't you make this into a kit maybe

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
other people are interested in this as

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
well

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
and so that's what the main topic is of

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,759
this

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
and it seemed to be a nice little bit of

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
follow-up work to yeah to to get this uh

224
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
as a kid and we spoke to a few kid

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,160
builders that we knew

226
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
uh about what to what to do how to

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,199
approach this

228
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,319
and

229
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,680
they were quite helpful to us and that's

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
also the reason why i'm now telling you

231
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
my lessons learned in the hope that you

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,799
will benefit from what we have learned

233
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,160
yeah so this is the working prototype i

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
think the work from the first

235
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
buying the ttl chips to this stage was

236
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
about 30 of the work

237
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
and from this stage to actually having

238
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
kits that we could sell was about 70 of

239
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,839
the work so that's something that some

240
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
people do overlook they think ah this is

241
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
all nice we have a prototype we're ready

242
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
no we are not even halfway

243
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,680
that doesn't mean that the rest of the

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
process isn't fun because it was quite

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
interesting

246
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
but it's not done it's it's quite a bit

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
of work

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,839
so this was june 2017 prototype and in

249
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
february 2018 we had the complete kit

250
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
that we could sell

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,560
so

252
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
a pcb in a nice little box

253
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,359
all the components manual controller etc

254
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
so this process of going from

255
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
this to this was about

256
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
well marcel and i two people we spent at

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
least two days a week on this for

258
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
that amount of time so you can imagine

259
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,959
that's quite a bit of work

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
we settled on a way of working where we

261
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
were being pragmatic

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,000
let's not overthink it but let's think

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
about every step of the way to find

264
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
quickly the best possible solution

265
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
for the kit we wanted to be

266
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
something that could still be a bit

267
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
useful in today's world

268
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
but we try to make it really retro and

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
70s

270
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
but we were pragmatic so for instance it

271
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
has vga output which was not really an

272
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
option in the 1970s but uh

273
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
and for me vj is quite normal because

274
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
i'm a bit of an older grumpy old hacker

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,640
but for people that live now vga is

276
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
already old school so there was a nice

277
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
yeah in the middle

278
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
and we also were pragmatic for instance

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
in the usage of the

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,360
chips that we used

281
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
so

282
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
we wanted it to be 70s where you would

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
be using

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
very high power consuming chips that are

285
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
also no longer to be found easily and we

286
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
settled for newer versions that are

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
plugin replacements

288
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
but are are using a lot less power

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
and another example is the power itself

290
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
the thing needs to be powered in the 70s

291
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
and 80s you would have a big honking

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,680
transformer on the unit

293
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
but we thought well this all runs on 5

294
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
volts so why don't you use usb power or

295
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,120
or we also so thought about a mains

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
adapter but then you would have the

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
problem of having different adapters for

298
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
different parts of

299
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
the world and with the usb it's much

300
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
easier

301
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
but then there's still usb c usb a

302
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
micro usb mini usb

303
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
and

304
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,440
here we

305
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
thought well

306
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
the usb the micro usb can be obtained in

307
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
a through-hole soldering variant

308
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
so that's

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
this one

310
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
and the other ones that you would

311
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
normally find on an end

312
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
system

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
are smd soldering smd soldering is not

314
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
that difficult but i do remember for

315
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
myself that the first time i did smd

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
soloing i was a bit apprehensive this

317
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
this might be this could be hard

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
it's not that hard but this could be an

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,839
issue for potential buyers

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,560
and we settled for the

321
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
mini usb

322
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,760
another example

323
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
the prototype board has two chips which

324
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
are prompts so they contain while the

325
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,399
gigatron works with eight bit

326
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,560
op codes and each one has one eight bit

327
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
data

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
eight bits of data and that's why there

329
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
are two roms in the original gigatron

330
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,680
and we combined them into one

331
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
and you can buy

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,480
those

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
16-bit prompts but

334
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
i grew up years ago when i opened up my

335
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
computers they would all have these nice

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
eeproms with a little glass inside where

337
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,399
you could erase them with uv light

338
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
and i really like that idea so

339
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,760
i wanted to get an eprom in there

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
of course if people buy the gigatron and

341
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,440
want to use an eeprom that you can

342
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,200
electronically erase it's a plug and

343
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
replacement but we settled for this

344
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
and also the clock i found in the

345
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
prototyping board

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,160
there is a clock made out of and now i

347
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
have to look because i always mix this

348
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,720
up this is a crystal oscillator

349
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
and this is actually a little

350
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
unit that contains several components

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
and i know from the old computers they

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,920
always have a crystal resonator and this

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
makes it a bit more complicated you need

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
few more extra components but i think it

355
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
really adds to the retro feel of the

356
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
system so that was changed as well in

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,880
the final design

358
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
one of the very important lessons in

359
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,160
creating a kit is to make things as

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
simple as possible this was also a goal

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
in the whole gigatron design process

362
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,560
but also for the kit it's very important

363
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
because less

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
stuff in the kit means that it is less

365
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
work to do for your packaging less

366
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
chances of errors in packaging and

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
missing items

368
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
it's also less work for the people

369
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,160
building the kit

370
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
and you will have a lower cost because

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
you have less components

372
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,600
and we try to

373
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,199
do as much as we could in software

374
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
instead of hardware minimizing on the

375
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
complexity and that worked quite well

376
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,639
it did mean we had to do some

377
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,120
concessions so in the at first marcel

378
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
was really keen on having really a super

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
standout form factor for this box for

380
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
this gigatron so

381
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,519
on the left you see a really nice

382
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,279
interesting

383
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
shape of interconnected pcbs and muscle

384
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
was thinking about a setup like this so

385
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
something that really catches your eye

386
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
and but of course this is incredibly

387
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
complex to make

388
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,279
to design

389
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,240
and

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
also error prone for people trying to

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
build this

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
and we spend a lot of time looking for

393
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,120
the right

394
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
enclosure

395
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
and we talked to uh to some people also

396
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
people from uh my hometown of eindhoven

397
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
of the crepton museum and they had a

398
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,360
tip to go to people who make cigar boxes

399
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
in the eindhoven region there used to be

400
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,480
a lot of cigar factories there are still

401
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
a few and this is this comes from a

402
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
cigar box factory

403
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,760
and

404
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,079
yeah it is a bit more dull it's it's uh

405
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,399
it's a rectangular shape

406
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
but it it works well and it still i

407
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
think looks pretty classy

408
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
and the supplier was really helpful he

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,839
said um because we thought we need to

410
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
have screws and hinges and stuff and

411
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
this guy was really super he said no we

412
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
can do this like this so we can put a

413
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
bit of plexiglass in there and then it

414
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
it fits in there nicely and you can just

415
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
close the lid and

416
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
we'll put some wood in and it will fit

417
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
without using any screws at all we just

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
need to drill some holes in the back for

419
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
the connectors

420
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
we also have some leds on top but they

421
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,079
do not need any holes because they we

422
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
have plexiglass on top

423
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,399
and it did mean that we decided not to

424
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,720
have any buttons at all on the device

425
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,880
because that would require additional

426
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
drilling or anything else to make that

427
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,279
work so we changed the electronics as

428
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,720
you see on the top right we added some

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
electronics to make sure that the system

430
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
will boot up nicely without having a

431
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
reset button and the reset can be done

432
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,240
in software

433
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
and then we needed a controller because

434
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
that was not included in the kit and we

435
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,839
had no idea what to use i found some

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
controllers on the the internet in china

437
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
somewhere and this is a famicom

438
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
controller

439
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
also known as the nest controller

440
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
so completely the same they come

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,920
normally with a nes

442
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,759
plug that you see on the left but this

443
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
plug well it's really hard to get the

444
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
connectors for them and they are hard to

445
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
find they're expensive

446
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
and but i did find a supplier read those

447
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
with a standard db9 connector which is

448
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,519
very common and very easy to get

449
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
and so we decided upon that one so we

450
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
bought it in china

451
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
just bought a few and we started

452
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,759
experimenting how this thing worked so

453
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
we put it on the oscilloscope and we

454
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,600
found out that it's really a very simple

455
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
shift register so you give it a pulse

456
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
and then you

457
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
to to wake it up then you give it a

458
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
second pulse

459
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
and each pulse you get one bit of button

460
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,959
data out of it and that was really great

461
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
because it allowed us to um

462
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
hook it up to the gigatron

463
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,360
actually without any additional hardware

464
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
uh why well now i go into a little bit

465
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
of technical detail

466
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,120
the microphone is outputting a bit

467
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
banging vga signal and a vga signal has

468
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
a horizontal sync pulse

469
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
at the end of every scan line

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
and then at the last line of the screen

471
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
it has a vertical sync pulse and we use

472
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,640
these to trigger the controller so every

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
every vertical sync pulse the controller

474
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,039
is being read and then every horizontal

475
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
line it reads one bit out of the button

476
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,280
state of the controller and for that we

477
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,319
just needed to add some extra wires

478
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
and fix the rest in software which was

479
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
great and also since we were working on

480
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
this we could also

481
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,559
add

482
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,760
leds

483
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
with just one component extra plus the

484
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
leds and audio out

485
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,000
with four extra components

486
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
the next big thing was

487
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,320
to get this onto a pcb because we had

488
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
the

489
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
the prototyping board but of course we

490
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,480
wanted to have a pcb and this required

491
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
learning key cat

492
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,799
and

493
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
getting all of this on there

494
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
and this is all

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
those traces are handmade

496
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
i mean you can do some out of tracing

497
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
but this is all made by hand to make

498
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,120
sure

499
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,200
that it looks nice but also that it is

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
logical so for instance

501
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
over here you see the algorithmic logic

502
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
unit and you see there's four chips here

503
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,720
on the outside and there as well and

504
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
those are 48 bits

505
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
that it uses in the calculations for

506
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,440
instance

507
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
so this is logically arranged but that

508
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
took a lot of work it took 10 weeks of

509
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
work to get this to the stage of this

510
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
board

511
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
and in this process we also

512
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,720
had to know which comp which actual

513
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
components we would be using in the kit

514
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
um because yeah you need to have the

515
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,400
right the holes in the right place

516
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
obviously and that's where we also

517
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,559
really tried to make sure that

518
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
everything that you can put in the board

519
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
cannot be accidentally switched

520
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,039
so on the right you see two types of

521
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,720
capacitors

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
and they have different values so they

523
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
should not be intermixed

524
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,600
so we selected from the vendor

525
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
different capacitors that have the

526
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
pins in a different spacing

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
so you it becomes harder to accidentally

528
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,720
swap them out

529
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
so these things were taken into account

530
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,360
for the uh for the pcb

531
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
and we made uh

532
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
a few

533
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
and there were two mistakes still in

534
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
there which we caught before we hooked

535
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
it up

536
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,880
we fixed those and we turned it on and

537
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,120
it actually worked and here you see it

538
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
showing a picture of itself as a

539
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
prototype board

540
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
i have to say we're a bit lucky because

541
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
this computer runs at a very low

542
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,160
frequency at 6.25 megahertz and at that

543
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
clock speed it's not really that

544
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
important how the traces are laid out if

545
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
you work on high frequency systems that

546
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
becomes really important

547
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
but for this system it's really tolerant

548
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
to making all kinds of rookie mistakes

549
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
in the rf field

550
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
so that was good

551
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,679
and lessons we had we um

552
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,280
from the people that we talked to from

553
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,600
the other kit vendors from the people

554
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,480
that made

555
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
pidp and from the crypto museum the

556
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,159
enigma

557
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,400
was that we should minimalize support

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
effort because that takes up a lot of

559
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,960
time if you supply a kit and it's not

560
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
really easy to build and people start

561
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
asking questions which of course they

562
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,760
are

563
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
entitled to do but that takes up a lot

564
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
of amount of a lot of time

565
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,880
and

566
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
it's better to spend the time up front

567
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
to make sure that everything is

568
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
everybody will be able to build it in

569
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
one go without any issues so that means

570
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
making everything unambiguous so that's

571
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
why we use a different component so they

572
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,039
cannot be intermixed

573
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,559
anticipate everything that somebody

574
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,360
could

575
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
could do wrong

576
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
and again simplicity so that was that

577
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
was a lot of work

578
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
in the end uh this prototype board

579
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
if you have really good eyes you can see

580
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,880
this version already version

581
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,600
1738

582
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,760
and a few versions later we had the

583
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,280
final board

584
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,400
and

585
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
here we did our best to make sure that

586
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
everything is labeled as good as we can

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
to avoid mistakes of people putting

588
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
chips in the other way around et cetera

589
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,679
then i remember we also

590
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,840
markson and i had a discussion about

591
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
sockets and that was really

592
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
controversial

593
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
discussion uh should we supply

594
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
chip sockets with the kit

595
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
so you solder in the socket and then you

596
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,159
put in the ic into the socket

597
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,280
and

598
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,440
well you could say the pro is that it

599
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
looks really neat it looks professional

600
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
like a high quality product and of

601
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
course if you make

602
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
if you ruin a chip you can just easily

603
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,559
replace it so those are the pros but it

604
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,080
is more costly because you have to add

605
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,520
them add them

606
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,039
you also need several types so you have

607
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,159
the mixing up problem again

608
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,679
and there's a lot of

609
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,120
there's a high chance that people who

610
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,640
are not accustomed

611
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
to using those to

612
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
insert the ics in the wrong way bending

613
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
pins and sometimes they bend to the

614
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,039
inside and you put in the ic and you

615
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
don't see that the pin is bent and it

616
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,320
gives rise to all kinds of problems so

617
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
we were

618
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
fearing all the support calls for those

619
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
and also the chip is not is there with a

620
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
a physical connection not a soldered

621
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,520
connection and that could also lead to

622
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
issues although maybe

623
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,799
not very often

624
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
in the end we settled that we needed a

625
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,280
socket for the eeprom because you want

626
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
to take it out and erase it and

627
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
reprogram it now you have zif sockets

628
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,679
zero insertion force sockets that are

629
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,440
that have a little lever to easily

630
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
extract them but they're really big and

631
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,600
bulky or they are not so bulky but

632
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,039
really expensive

633
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,280
and

634
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
we in the end we decided to use these

635
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
cheap dual leaf contact sockets they are

636
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
a bit lower quality but they have a bit

637
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
more tolerance for not putting in the

638
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,600
chip at the exact right spot it will

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,799
still fit

640
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,520
it makes it easier to insert the chip

641
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
for the ram socket well we also put it

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,760
in a socket to allow for further ram

643
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
upgrades and here we use a more quality

644
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
turn socket but we it's it's got quite

645
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,080
hard to put a chip into a 28 pin socket

646
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,159
if you've never done that before so you

647
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,679
need to make sure that the pins are

648
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,000
straight so i decided to

649
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
to bend them and insert them in the

650
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
socket

651
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,799
for every kit so the kit comes with a

652
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,799
pre-inserted ram into the socket

653
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
the problem is well that if you

654
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
if you if you now

655
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
sold or any of the other ics into the

656
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
board and you do it the wrong way around

657
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,200
uh yeah then you are really out of luck

658
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,000
you it's you can desolder a complete

659
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,799
chip

660
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
but if you do not have the experience in

661
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
doing so you probably will ruin the

662
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
complete pcb and we've had cases of

663
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
people doing so and we

664
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,600
advised everybody who's soldered them in

665
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,320
the wrong way to just cut all the pins

666
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
and then solder out the pins one by one

667
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,440
which is quite easy

668
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
and then

669
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
ask us for a new chip and put that money

670
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,600
so that was the components and then we

671
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,440
had to have a manual so i spent about a

672
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,159
man month on creating this manual that

673
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,320
was a lot of work but it includes a

674
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,440
little bit of information about

675
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,679
electronics how all the components work

676
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
it includes information about soldering

677
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,520
how to use solar

678
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,799
and here you can see a picture of how

679
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
you bend the ics to make them fit into

680
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
the board or in the in sockets

681
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,679
as yeah so the soldering

682
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,520
instructions

683
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,720
and we also have it in a ring so you can

684
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,960
lay it flat which makes it easier to

685
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
have it open next to your on your bench

686
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
while you are soldering so we thought

687
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
about all these things

688
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
and actually this is after the wooden

689
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
case that we supply with a kit this was

690
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,360
the most expensive

691
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
part to make as well

692
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,080
i don't know is there anybody here who

693
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,799
has uh experience with the heath kit

694
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,919
do-it-yourself kids by any chance

695
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,480
anybody heard of those heathcat kits

696
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
those were a thing of the past as one

697
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
person knows them

698
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
i think of the past but they had really

699
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
awesome

700
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
manuals as you can see here

701
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
i i looked up this image after the fact

702
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
after i've written the manual but you

703
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
see this one also has

704
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
soldering tips how how do you solder how

705
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
do you recognize bad soldering

706
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
and that's that's really helpful because

707
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
it saves a lot of work in

708
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,919
in fixing problems later if people make

709
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
mistakes

710
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,320
so that led to this uh

711
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,559
manual and what also was really helpful

712
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
is that we were doing this as a team

713
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
and for instance markup has a lot of

714
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,640
experience in software i have less

715
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,200
experience in software

716
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
but i had more experience in soldering

717
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,679
whereas marshall didn't and that really

718
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,480
helps to view to get other viewpoints

719
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,600
and for the soldering for instance

720
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,039
martial told me that the first time he

721
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,279
was soldering he put in the ic on top of

722
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,279
the pcb and also soldered on the top

723
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,080
side

724
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,840
and i had not i had not thought about

725
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
people

726
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,960
doing this because i had been soldering

727
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
all my life and i know you sold on the

728
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
on the bottom side

729
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,400
but that's really useful information

730
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
because now the manual can clearly uh

731
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
warn people for such mistakes that

732
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,520
people will probably make

733
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
and actually it's it's quite a lot of

734
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
kits were sold to people who did not

735
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
have any prior soldering skills and they

736
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
were still able to create this kit so

737
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
that was uh that was really good

738
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
oh yeah and also i'm used to uh i've

739
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,880
been soldering and doing electronics for

740
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200
a long time so i know the

741
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
resistor color coding table

742
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,200
on the top of my head but nowadays

743
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
people use smd

744
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
resistors and they just have the number

745
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,559
on there so they are not used to using

746
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
the color so we need to add the color

747
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
codes but i also made sure that in the

748
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,159
steps where it describes how to actually

749
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,080
put the components onto the board that

750
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
it does not only say you need to insert

751
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
a 10k resistor but also has the brown

752
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
leg etc coding on there to make sure

753
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,640
that people use the right

754
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
components

755
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,440
because not everybody

756
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,279
likes to read but

757
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,520
people nowadays normally will go to

758
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,440
youtube to find information on how to do

759
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
stuff

760
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
myself included we thought let's also

761
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,520
make a series of videos so the kind

762
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
people of again the crypto museum in

763
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,559
eindhoven

764
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,399
helped me out and provided me the space

765
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,200
to do some soldering and i made a

766
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
13

767
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
i made 13 videos of the whole process

768
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
going through the whole gigatron build

769
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,840
um i checked yesterday and we're now at

770
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,720
about 500 views i'm not sure if this

771
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,520
this is people who are just

772
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
like somebody to solder stuff and tell

773
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
people about it or if they are actually

774
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,399
building a kit

775
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,559
but i think it was a nice addition

776
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,279
then sourcing parts if you build a kit

777
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
you need to have the parts and what's

778
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,559
important that

779
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,640
in for your prototype you just buy the

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
parts you're done but if you buy if you

781
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
want to make a kit and sell it

782
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
for a extended period of time you need

783
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,520
to make sure that you are able to get

784
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,480
those components for all of that time

785
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
so we looked around

786
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,880
to see what the kind of people had these

787
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
components and what their stock was and

788
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
we found out well the game controller we

789
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,600
had no idea how many there were in stock

790
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,000
so we took a bit of a gamble

791
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
the crystal was a bit of an issue and

792
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,360
there is one resistor network that might

793
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,520
be an issue

794
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,480
but that looked to be okay

795
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
for stock and then also we need the

796
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,159
parts to be reliable so we heard some

797
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,919
really horror stories about cheap

798
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,679
components being bought

799
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,240
even chips that were bought that turned

800
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
out to be empty shells with bins that

801
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
that does happen sometimes so we went

802
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,080
for sources like mouse gtk farnell to be

803
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
sure that we had the correct parts

804
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
except for three components

805
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,279
the eeprom

806
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,000
is

807
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
no longer really in production i think i

808
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,360
assume

809
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,799
but we found a source that had a lot of

810
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,520
them and they looked to be new i also

811
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
did the swap test to see if the label

812
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,919
was not printed on later but it looked

813
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,440
to be a genuine part

814
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,840
and for this component it's not that

815
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
critical because i need to program it

816
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
anyway before it's being put in the kit

817
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
so we know that it is working

818
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
now the controller that was a bit of an

819
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,039
issue because we ordered a few of them

820
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,480
we sold some kits

821
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,039
it works fine and then we ordered our

822
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,799
second batch and then the controller was

823
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,720
different so there was different

824
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
electronics inside and to be technical

825
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
one was

826
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
was activated by an up flank and the

827
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,799
other with a downward flank so we had to

828
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,960
rewrite the software but we weren't able

829
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
to make it work as smooth as the first

830
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,720
controller so all the people

831
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,559
here and on the stream that have bought

832
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,159
from that

833
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,120
batch

834
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
my apologies for the controller not

835
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,039
being as smooth as it could have been

836
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,200
and we had some problems with usb cables

837
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,919
that were substandard so they had a huge

838
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
voltage drop over them and if the

839
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
voltage drops the get one no longer

840
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,880
works reliably and for the next patch we

841
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
switch to

842
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,480
awg28 which is a measure of thickness of

843
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,080
the copper inside of the cable so

844
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,919
thicker cables and then all these

845
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
problems were gone luckily

846
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
now the first batch was 10 systems that

847
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,360
we gave to beta testers to get valuable

848
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,720
feedback about things that we could

849
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,919
still improve and then we had a hundred

850
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,039
uh

851
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
a batch of a hundred

852
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,480
and of course the advantage of buying in

853
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,159
bulk is that you get bulk discounts so

854
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,880
they start at 25 or 50 or 100 or or even

855
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
more

856
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
so we thought well

857
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
let's hope we can sell 100 actually

858
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,159
our our goal was to outsell the apple

859
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,200
one

860
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,919
which sold 200 back in the day

861
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,279
so we hope you were going to make that

862
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,120
we had no idea if we were ever going to

863
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,640
get there but we thought we could take

864
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,919
the risk of buying for a hundred

865
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,399
to uh to drop the cost so let's talk

866
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,679
about the cost

867
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
um if you build a kit

868
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
and you are going to sell it you need to

869
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,440
determine what the end user price will

870
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
be how do you do that is the cost of

871
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,039
components

872
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,760
no it's more and this is something that

873
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
i didn't know at the time but i took it

874
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,679
from the url here at the bottom and it

875
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,080
says you take the cost of the stuff you

876
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,240
bought for the kit you do it times 1.66

877
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
to get your wholesale price and then you

878
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
do that again to get your

879
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
retail price

880
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,399
and that might seem like a lot

881
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,760
um actually we were below that figure

882
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,519
but we upped it

883
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,159
substantially but we need to pay taxes

884
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,559
we need to pay income tax on what we

885
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,919
what we make

886
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
and what people sometimes forget is the

887
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,679
amount of work that has gone into

888
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,600
building the kit so we did get a few

889
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
people saying but i can buy these

890
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,880
components for uh

891
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,320
80 euros

892
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
why should i buy a double that amount

893
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,080
well that's because there's also a few

894
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,960
menus or men yeah more than a manual in

895
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
a few maybe two into a design and then

896
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,679
going from the design to the actual kit

897
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,799
and the process

898
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,960
when we got the kit it still costs time

899
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
to package all the kits and ship them

900
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,600
out so that was about 0.2 fte

901
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
continuously for the time we sold those

902
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
kits for two years

903
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
so that is also to be taken into account

904
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,760
and we need to reserve money for kids

905
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,519
that are being

906
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,360
returned or

907
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,120
get broken or lost or whatever

908
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
um so that that figure is not that

909
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
strange

910
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
if you're going to make it you will also

911
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
need to realize that you need to do an

912
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
upfront investment

913
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,440
because you need to buy your stuff

914
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,039
before you get your income from from

915
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,320
selling them

916
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,799
and it is nice to get a legal entity to

917
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,799
make sure that everything is in order

918
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,200
with your local laws

919
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
i would also advise to discuss the

920
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
financial with the partners you're

921
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
working with on the kit first of all i

922
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,799
would

923
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,799
advise you to work with a partner

924
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,880
because it's more fun to do things in a

925
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
group but also because you can learn

926
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,760
from each other

927
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
that really worked well with marshall

928
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,159
and me

929
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,640
but also discuss the financials

930
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
what if somebody

931
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
excellently needs to stop with the

932
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,120
project which well unfortunately marcel

933
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,799
had to

934
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,720
so it's good to make

935
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,559
agreements upfront

936
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,399
on what happens next

937
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,960
and also talk about the amount of work

938
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,360
that each of the team puts into the kit

939
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
and how you then

940
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,559
share the

941
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,919
the earnings

942
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
in a fair way

943
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,440
i'd also like to talk a bit about kit

944
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
packaging because that's quite a lot of

945
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
work as well

946
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,799
so

947
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,320
as i said we made sure that all the

948
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,279
components were different

949
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,480
and not so easy to uh to mix up so we

950
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,159
could put all these standard components

951
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,279
into a little anti-static bag

952
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,760
and that's that

953
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,000
and i did that using the rule check

954
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,440
everything twice

955
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
so i would make for each of the

956
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,879
components that need to go into the bag

957
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,760
i made little piles of maybe 10 or 20 of

958
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,800
these components so i can count them

959
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
then i take the back and put in all the

960
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,000
components that need to go in there

961
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and once all the bags are done then

962
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,159
there should be no components left

963
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
and if there's a resistor left

964
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,079
then i know that one of the bags will be

965
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,520
missing a resistor and i have a lot of

966
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,480
work and finding out which one

967
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,800
and then i also needed to

968
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,280
count all the ics the chips that go in

969
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,239
there so i use a piece of anti-static

970
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,679
foam on which to put all the chips

971
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,599
so i would open up a tube with a chip

972
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,760
type a put in the chips then next one

973
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
next one

974
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,159
and this gives a really easy visual clue

975
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
of whether the kit is complete or not

976
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,960
and again check them twice

977
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
then the

978
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
bag the ics the pcb all other stuff went

979
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
into the little box and again i would

980
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
make little bars

981
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
collect them

982
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,160
and check them checked if all the piles

983
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,200
were empty at the end

984
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,920
yeah this is a kit that came back after

985
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,200
a round trip over the world so

986
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
some kids

987
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,520
i bought a kit last a few months ago

988
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,920
which was really nicely packaged so it

989
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,079
was specially purpose made foam with

990
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
indents where all the components went

991
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,079
into and that was really nice because if

992
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,599
you shake it well it still stays in

993
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,960
place

994
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,680
this foam does hold the chips quite well

995
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
and in most cases it will work quite

996
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,359
well but if it is really

997
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,599
handled in a bad way by the

998
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,040
local

999
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,320
postal office

1000
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
this is what you get

1001
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
but this was really incidental so it was

1002
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,400
for us it was good enough

1003
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
and then in the end the

1004
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,520
box with the components the manual and

1005
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
the controller will put in a

1006
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
envelope and again we would do that

1007
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,079
twice and if i were done then forget to

1008
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,760
put a manual in one of the boxes and

1009
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
have one left at the end

1010
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,880
yeah it would be a bit harder because i

1011
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
would need to open all of the envelopes

1012
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
to see which one was missing but of

1013
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
course you can then

1014
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
weigh all your envelopes to see which

1015
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
one is lighter so you know where you

1016
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
forgot the manual

1017
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,640
now we solved the kit for two years and

1018
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,560
uh we met our goal of selling more than

1019
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,119
200 we actually sold over a thousand and

1020
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
as i said it cost about 0.2 fte

1021
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
during that time to do all the packaging

1022
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,760
of all the

1023
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
and people have asked

1024
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,200
couldn't you find some cheap labor to do

1025
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
that for you well

1026
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,880
we didn't actually trust others with

1027
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
that i'm not sure if that's the right

1028
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,880
decision well actually i i think

1029
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
my opinion is it was the right decision

1030
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
because if there was a mistake the

1031
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
amount of work that it takes to solve

1032
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,079
that problem

1033
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,400
yeah that's quite an investment in in

1034
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
time

1035
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
we've also got questions about pre-built

1036
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,599
kits

1037
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,599
can we can we provide them

1038
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,839
and the short answer is no if you decide

1039
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,920
to build a kit

1040
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
it best is to sell them in cat form

1041
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,359
because then a lot of rules and

1042
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,480
regulations do not apply if you build a

1043
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,720
ready-build electronics device you will

1044
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,440
need to have ce and fcc

1045
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,359
markings on there and that's a really

1046
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,880
costly long laborious process

1047
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,000
in the middle you see a test i did with

1048
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
mark siemens who had a nice device to

1049
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
check the rf emanations from the device

1050
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
and it's horrible so this will never

1051
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
pass any fcc test

1052
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,359
and

1053
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,440
yeah but selling as a kit no problem

1054
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,920
with that at all

1055
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,280
for shipping

1056
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,599
you can shop around for a good bulk

1057
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
shipping

1058
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,560
person

1059
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
but there is no one-size-fits-all you

1060
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,320
will in the end have to deal with

1061
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
different shipping options if people

1062
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,400
live in manila they cannot rely on the

1063
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
local post office you will need to use

1064
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,800
dhl or fedex or something else to be

1065
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,560
able to send over there

1066
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,799
and

1067
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,280
insurance we

1068
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,359
it would be nice but we we decided not

1069
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,200
to have insurance in the beginning we

1070
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,720
did have insurance and then if your

1071
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,880
packets get lost you can apply for the

1072
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
insurance but then they will say well

1073
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,160
we'll only reimburse you the the cost of

1074
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
the components in the kit not the amount

1075
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,480
of money you sold it for and please show

1076
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,200
me all the paperwork that explains how

1077
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,119
much the components were worth so it's a

1078
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,520
lot of hassle and it's actually cheaper

1079
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,560
to just have these few parcels be lost

1080
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,359
and not pay for all this insurance and

1081
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,359
yeah in the end maybe

1082
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,400
yeah

1083
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,079
a a portion of

1084
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,200
a percent uh had an issue

1085
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,520
and some places are really hard to send

1086
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,680
packages to so there was one sent to

1087
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,560
brian in the falklands and that one did

1088
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
never arrive unfortunately

1089
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
we also try to exceed customer

1090
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
expectations so make something that

1091
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,359
people are really happy with and they

1092
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,960
are get happy from getting something

1093
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
that is better than they expected to be

1094
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
getting so that's why we may spend so

1095
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,599
much time on the manual make it super

1096
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,400
make the support better than expected

1097
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
so they're happy with the with the whole

1098
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,359
experience

1099
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,320
and support we did via email but we also

1100
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,560
try to do a lot of for people to do self

1101
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,640
help so we had

1102
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,560
a website on the internet with all kinds

1103
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,599
of guides

1104
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,760
how to measure voltages to pinpoint a

1105
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,800
problem and quite early on we

1106
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,760
we made a forum

1107
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,720
and

1108
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
we had very limited issues with the with

1109
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,320
the parts that we got in uh only with

1110
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
the controller problem i told you about

1111
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,560
and once believe it or not we had a

1112
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
customer saying uh there were the wrong

1113
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
resistors in my package well no worry

1114
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
because i'm an electronics geek so i

1115
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,720
have enough spare ones

1116
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,560
and then somebody else said i'm also

1117
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,880
missing resistors and it turned out i

1118
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
had swapped them in the two different

1119
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,960
bags and of course my little piles were

1120
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
all down to zero so i didn't notice that

1121
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,000
i had swapped

1122
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
resistors in two packages but that was

1123
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,200
the only mistake i made in the in two

1124
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,078
years so that's fine

1125
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
marketing we did a little bit

1126
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,520
first of all we used a really nice

1127
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
white

1128
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,200
box to send them in to to get that first

1129
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
experience of ah this is a nice kit but

1130
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,160
of course we also need to do some

1131
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,480
marketing via vloggers and we decided to

1132
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,440
send a kit to

1133
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,680
the 8-bit guy

1134
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
who has a blog about 8-bit computing and

1135
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
we already knew in advance that he would

1136
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,680
not like the fact that it would not run

1137
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,960
basic

1138
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,640
actually the current version does run

1139
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,200
basic but the first version didn't

1140
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,119
and he also commented about it but he

1141
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,160
did a really nice review and that video

1142
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,400
now has almost two and a half million

1143
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,640
hits so that was really great and we

1144
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
also sent one to the eevblog which is an

1145
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,640
electronics guy and this was cool

1146
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,359
because he got to get and he opened it

1147
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,319
up

1148
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,119
on his channel and he saw the manual

1149
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,520
said that's nice do it away and then he

1150
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,920
just started he saw on the on the pcb

1151
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,280
what it what should be on there and he

1152
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
just started soldering all the stuff on

1153
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,960
there without any manual at all and he

1154
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,319
got it working from the first try so

1155
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,720
that was really great and he did a he

1156
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
did a live

1157
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,160
soldering session video

1158
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,319
and he also did some follow-up videos

1159
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
about ah this is a nice system to show

1160
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,920
you the difference between two layer and

1161
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,720
four layer pcbs so

1162
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,160
together with us he made a four layer

1163
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,319
pcb and he did some measurements to see

1164
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,240
what the differences are and he also did

1165
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,839
a video about the

1166
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,279
caps that are there um

1167
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,880
well with bypass capacitors

1168
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
so that was cool

1169
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
and we sold uh

1170
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,119
quite a few in the first month we sold

1171
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,440
to 25 countries we sold to companies

1172
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,240
like microsoft apple google facebook

1173
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,440
ibm

1174
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
we sold to apple but i don't think we

1175
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,240
sold to steve wozniak which was our

1176
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,359
super super goal

1177
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,720
we also created this community on uh

1178
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,960
on forum.gigatron.io

1179
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
and then it took off a little bit and

1180
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,400
that was really great to see if you if

1181
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,119
you have your your your brainchild come

1182
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,000
to life with people starting to use it

1183
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,640
and experiment themselves and after one

1184
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,319
month we had some some additional

1185
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,440
software

1186
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,520
um we had sprites

1187
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
uh we had people doing hardware like ram

1188
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,359
extensions

1189
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,480
um

1190
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
we had

1191
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,400
somebody who built a

1192
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
a really fast version using special fast

1193
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,839
ttl chips that would run at quite a

1194
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,359
large speed

1195
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,599
but of course then the screen is reduced

1196
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,960
we had things like this like a special

1197
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,680
breadboard sorry breadboard pcb with

1198
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,839
everything uh

1199
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,079
in a very small form factor

1200
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,280
with a more rom and four layer pcb

1201
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,480
we had software like a c compiler people

1202
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,640
are working on for fourth for the

1203
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,839
gigatron

1204
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,040
we have video repeaters we have all

1205
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,280
kinds of other stuff and in the end it's

1206
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
it's it's crazy what what people have

1207
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,800
written so on the right yeah that's

1208
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,119
actually coming from a system without a

1209
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,400
microprocessor

1210
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,680
with just

1211
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,839
under a thousand

1212
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
logic gates

1213
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,400
doing the vga as well so that was cool

1214
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,480
now issues there weren't many one issue

1215
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,920
we were worried about in the beginning

1216
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,200
was what if somebody takes our idea and

1217
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,160
just clones the pcb

1218
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,119
copycats and it was only

1219
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,880
after one and a half years that we found

1220
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,720
on ebay this

1221
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,960
diggatron from

1222
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,599
and russia

1223
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,760
was curious muscle was furious i was

1224
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,319
curious i ordered one i had a look and

1225
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,560
this thing does not work at all it is

1226
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,040
really not a working copy but it was

1227
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,640
interesting to see and there were only

1228
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,359
maybe 10 sold and that was it

1229
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,079
so we didn't have any problems with that

1230
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,640
we did expect that it would be a nice

1231
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,240
kit for uh educational institutes but um

1232
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,480
in fact uh yeah we didn't set well we

1233
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,800
sold some to universities and such but

1234
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,560
not that many as we would have expected

1235
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
another issue that we had there was one

1236
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,119
guy who uh who in the beginning asked

1237
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,280
for schematics he was also working on a

1238
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,359
on a cpu for himself

1239
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,800
which we explained were in the manual

1240
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,280
and then suddenly he became bathmousing

1241
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,760
us on all kinds of occasions we just

1242
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,880
ignored him

1243
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,240
and so did the other people's on the

1244
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,480
people on the internet so that was also

1245
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
controllable

1246
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,880
now after two years the project ended

1247
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,280
at that time marcel was was terminally

1248
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,240
ill we spoke about this project

1249
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
he had actually plans to continue and

1250
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,880
maybe port cpm to it and do some other

1251
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,839
stuff

1252
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,640
and i said well actually you know

1253
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,200
it was really fun to create to make the

1254
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,599
design and also make the kit

1255
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,520
but you know

1256
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,000
putting resistors in little bags

1257
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
for one day a week

1258
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,920
yeah that's really work that's not

1259
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,359
that's not hacking

1260
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,400
uh so for me the the the there was no

1261
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
not much fun in there well there's still

1262
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,480
fun in in following the community and

1263
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
what people are building but not so much

1264
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,520
in yeah creating actual kits

1265
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
so everything was then open sourced you

1266
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,119
can find everything online and a few

1267
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,280
companies have started to sell kits as

1268
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,599
well they don't have the manual which

1269
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,960
you can download from the internet and

1270
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,800
they don't have the nice little wooden

1271
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,119
box and some also do not include a

1272
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,920
controller but it is enough to get a

1273
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,200
working gigatron

1274
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,760
so important lessons that we've learned

1275
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,200
is it really pays off to have a

1276
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,800
minimalistic design

1277
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,520
that makes it easier to create the kit

1278
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,760
it makes it cheaper it makes it less

1279
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,839
error prone

1280
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,079
the problematic approach

1281
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,599
we tried to

1282
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,680
have a set of rules to stick by like

1283
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,960
making it a

1284
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,440
70s 80s error machine but where needed

1285
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,119
we would deviate a little bit where we

1286
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,520
felt it was still right

1287
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,680
and try to put a lot of effort not in

1288
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,640
support after you've sold the kits but

1289
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,119
get that time spent

1290
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,960
in advance to make sure that people do

1291
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,680
not need the support

1292
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
make sure that you have a team because

1293
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,200
two no more than one so that really

1294
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,359
helps in making the product better

1295
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,440
and we were lucky that we

1296
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,119
in the in the beginning

1297
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,960
made sure that we were able to update

1298
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,280
the software later

1299
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,480
and add functionality to it

1300
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,079
and of course most important is to just

1301
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,240
have fun doing this it's a really fun

1302
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
project you learn a lot

1303
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,960
and stop when it becomes work

1304
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,720
and the greatest achievement i think

1305
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,359
we've got is that in the end one was

1306
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,839
sent to steve wozniak so i know he has

1307
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,720
one

1308
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,520
he was impressed by the chip account on

1309
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,640
the system

1310
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
and he actually did sign

1311
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,280
a gigatron that i have here

1312
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,520
so to infinity and beyond

1313
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,270
thank you very much for your attention

1314
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:22,240
[Applause]

1315
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,839
and maybe i have 30 seconds for

1316
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,280
questions or

1317
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,800
yeah go for it you've got i got two

1318
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,960
minutes so yeah if there's any questions

1319
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,680
um for gigawaltz please uh quickly head

1320
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,440
up to my friends in the center

1321
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,920
and be brief

1322
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,280
yes on the front microphone um

1323
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,800
was a little closer please was sending

1324
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,280
kids to these guys on youtube really all

1325
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,359
the marketing you did like all the

1326
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,839
public relations whatever

1327
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:54,559
yeah

1328
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,480
what we did was um

1329
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,760
well the most of the marketing was on

1330
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,240
hackaday.io so that created already a

1331
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
bit of a buzz and then the online

1332
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,319
marketing we did was only create a forum

1333
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,480
that we didn't advertise any further

1334
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,559
and the two youtube videos

1335
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,079
all right thank you you're welcome

1336
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,680
yes

1337
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
um hi

1338
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,760
on the question of how to sourcing as

1339
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,040
two source parts you mentioned in our to

1340
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,520
our resistor network yeah

1341
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
if that was such a problem wouldn't it

1342
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,800
have been easier to just use uh discrete

1343
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,880
resistors there yeah so that was our

1344
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,319
backup plan so we thought if the

1345
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,400
resistor network is no longer available

1346
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,440
we'll just

1347
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,160
get some resistors and actually

1348
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
they have now become really hard to

1349
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,280
source so one of the suppliers that is

1350
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,520
now selling gigatron kits is using that

1351
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,960
approach

1352
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,240
okay thank you so it was a good question

1353
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,599
thank you can you tell us something

1354
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,559
about how people program the gigatron

1355
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,000
yeah there are several ways to program

1356
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,839
it we have a well you can program it in

1357
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,000
machine language but that is really hard

1358
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,440
because you have to keep track of all

1359
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,520
the timing to make sure that the vga

1360
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,359
signal is still correct so nobody does

1361
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,319
that

1362
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,760
then we have something called the

1363
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,760
gigatron command language gcl that's

1364
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,000
a rather low level still but good enough

1365
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,640
to be used to create some games or other

1366
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,760
other things

1367
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
and now of course we also have

1368
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,440
the little c compiler we have basic

1369
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,319
so there are a few ways to program it

1370
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,160
but do you need to refresh the eprom

1371
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,000
yeah so basically you need to refresh

1372
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,359
the apron but there are now hardware

1373
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,200
extensions so this is the hardware

1374
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,839
extension that also includes an sd card

1375
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,520
where you can just

1376
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
put your files on the sd card and run

1377
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,480
them from there

1378
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,839
so that's not part of the original

1379
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,280
design that's something that came out of

1380
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,720
our community

1381
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,959
nice

1382
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
thank you so much for your questions um

1383
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,040
i think all the remains is to join me in

1384
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,760
thanking gigawalt for a fantastic talk

1385
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,920
thank you
