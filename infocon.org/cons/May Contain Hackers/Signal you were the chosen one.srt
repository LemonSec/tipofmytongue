00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,880
uh

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,119
my name is rishek and

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,720
i use signal

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,960
as many of you here and i've been using

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
signal for a long while

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,439
in fact i have asked pushed convinced

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
and implored my friends family and

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
colleagues to also use signal

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,559
as many of you have here who has who has

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
actually pushed their friends family etc

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
to use signal

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
yeah okay was it easy

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
no it was work right it was it was it

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
was like

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,719
you had to put in some uh elbow grease

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,840
um

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
and i i'm happy to say i was pretty

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
effective at it too uh so that's good

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,360
and

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
just to make it very clear i do

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,719
appreciate the free and

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,520
quite solid service uh that signal

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
offers and i still recommend it to

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
people whose threat model you know has

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,840
the shape that signal kind of fits into

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,400
um

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
i also think that valid criticism is

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
necessary for a healthy ecosystem

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
whether

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,720
the ecosystem is moving or not

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
and criticizing signal seems to have

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
that seems to often be wrought with

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,280
peril

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
talking about its problems often

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
can end up in pushing people to

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
way worse solutions i'm not going to

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
name them on telegram

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
but but this is this is a real problem

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
right we cannot have those conversations

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
very often in the public uh because

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
there's a danger that people will

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
misinterpret them and and move to

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
something that is actually actively

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
putting them in danger

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
uh but thankfully we are at a place and

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,439
time where i think it is reasonable to

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,560
assume that

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
most of us can

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
somehow figure out

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
that maybe you know we can criticize a

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,719
tool and still

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
probably use it because it's still

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
probably better than uh or almost

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,720
certainly better than than most of the

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,599
uh

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
similar tools available and and popular

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
uh so maybe we could have this

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,200
conversation now and when i say

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
conversation i i mean it we're going to

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
have a conversation you're not going to

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
be just sleeping through a bunch of

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,959
slides

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
one of the reasons for this is because

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
this is my only slide

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,599
that's all you get

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
everything else

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
is me talking and then hopefully you

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,959
talking and then you know

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
magic might happen

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,160
um

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
so

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,319
just to make it very clear if any and

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,160
during this like at any point during

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
this exercise anyone here here gets an

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
urge to switch to whatsapp telegram or

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
oh i was not supposed to name them sorry

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,959
uh to

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
to some other tools uh and platforms

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
please wait a bit and just let's have a

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
conversation later uh uh because threat

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
models differ and and and all of that

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,599
right

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,959
um

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,000
but

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,959
i do consider most of those tools uh

87
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
lesser to signal outside very specific

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
uh circumstances

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
um

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,440
yeah okay so

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
um

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,720
i'm just a random guy from the internet

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,599
hi

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,480
uh

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
and i have my opinions so i will lay out

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
those opinions uh on you

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,640
uh

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
it is very

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
important to understand that i have not

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
designed a global system of

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
communication that hundreds of millions

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,319
of people are using successfully to

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
evade you know and and stay private and

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
and all of that so take all of

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
everything that i say with a solid

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
amount of salt uh

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
salt also improves flavor so it might

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
make actually palatable what i'm saying

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,439
so

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,840
i also have this crazy idea

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
uh that this should not just be my

112
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,519
opinions because that would be boring um

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
does anyone here have strong opinions

114
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,159
about signal

115
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
only that that

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
yeah okay we'll see what happens after

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
like a little bit later

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
so

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,440
in

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,360
december 2019 at 30 30 63 at the

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
congress uh moxie gave a talk uh uh

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,000
imaginatively uh entitled

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
ecosystem

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,759
ecosystem is moving uh which was exactly

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,280
the same title he used for a blog post

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
hero three years prior about exactly the

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,880
same subject and

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
basically having exactly the same

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
content

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,000
uh however

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
this talk came and went and then there

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
was a q a session where you know five

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
micro microphones had a line

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
each mile long or a kilometer long or

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
whatever you want to however you want to

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
measure this line uh

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
the length of the line

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
and i think only three questions were

139
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
asked and then the q a was shut down

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,479
so what i would like to do is to have

141
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,280
this q a now

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
like we didn't get to have this q a with

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
moxie so i would like to give the

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
opportunity to have this q a with me i'm

145
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
not going to answer like moxie would

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
have but i think it's a conversation

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,759
that we should have had and we never got

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,880
to have

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,960
and i find that i find that annoying so

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
i would i would like to propose somewhat

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
of a reverse talk

152
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
where the q a will start

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
basically immediately if anyone has an

154
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
opinion to share already please step up

155
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
to the microphone and and

156
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
and we'll we'll

157
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
huh

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
and we'll go from there

159
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
uh

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
i hope that this will offer a little bit

161
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
of group therapy because i i do feel um

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
so

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,759
uh yeah so i do feel that we were denied

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,639
this conversation i do feel we have

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
things bottled in or

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
inside about signal and i think we it

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,479
would be it would be useful to uh

168
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,680
share them

169
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
last disclaimer i promise i know those

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,639
disclaimers are you know mile long again

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,600
uh this is all i miss all i'm saying is

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
my personal opinions i'm not doing a uh

173
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
threat analysis or you know threat

174
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
modeling or a proper audit of signal in

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,080
any

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,639
sense of the word this is just

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
one guy from the internets

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
talking about his opinions about signal

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
and hopefully more people will join

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
and and we will have this uh group

181
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
therapy together

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
so i'll start because i already am with

183
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,720
like with the microphone um

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
and i will say that personally my

185
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
biggest gripe with signal is that it is

186
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
a centralized service

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
right it is a good service it is a

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
useful service it is effective in what

189
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
it does but it's still a centralized

190
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,240
service um and of course moxie has uh

191
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
has given very good reasons for it and

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
all of those reasons boil basically down

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,960
to

194
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
control

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
right you need

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
he feels or

197
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
that's what he says or

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
and writes that he just needs to have

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
the control

200
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,919
or signal

201
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
developers have to have control over the

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,800
ecosystem and over the over the app and

203
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
the basic argument goes something like

204
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
this making sure that signal keeps

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
working on all the platforms it supports

206
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
is already a lot of work and that's true

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
adding federation to the mix adding you

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
know the ability to say oh you know

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
anyone can set up a server and this this

210
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,199
server these servers will talk

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
to any other signal server and you will

212
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
be able to have you know accounts on

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,759
your own server and talk to other

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
servers

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
that adds a level a layer um

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
a layer of complexity and it would make

217
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
it even more difficult to roll out new

218
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,759
features and

219
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
important bug fixes and and all of that

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,199
and

221
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
the argument continues in effect

222
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
competing with whatsapp and telegrams of

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
these worlds would not be possible or

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
would not be

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
as easy or well as

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
it would be way more difficult

227
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,199
and of course moxie is not wrong right

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,240
it would

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
make it more difficult adding federation

230
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
to the to the mix would in fact make

231
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
things more complicated and it would

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
make it harder to innovate fast that

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,479
said anyone is familiar with the phrase

234
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,279
move fast and break things

235
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
like

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
does it have a good vibe

237
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
it has a

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
it has like it leaves a bad taste in

239
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
your mouth i think right i don't think

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
i don't think tools and services as

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,360
important as signal and i think we can

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
all agree that signal is pretty

243
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
important and maybe some of us can agree

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,839
that signal is effectively

245
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
infrastructure for many of us right it's

246
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
not just a service we use it for many

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,360
like for for many of us it is part of

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,440
our infrastructure that we're using

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
every day

250
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
um

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
uh i don't think we want our

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,720
infrastructure to be managed in the move

253
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
fast and break things

254
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
manner

255
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,880
right i think

256
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
i think we might we might

257
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
agree on that

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
and

259
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
also

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
yes not using like you know not adding

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
federation makes things a little bit

262
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
easier but you know what would also make

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,080
things easier not adding encryption

264
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
right it would be way easier to write

265
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
signal if there was no encryption in it

266
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
like that's a level of complexity so i

267
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
think it's not a question of shying away

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,640
of

269
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,720
from complexity it is a choice that was

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
made

271
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
right um

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
and i don't think that's a that's a very

273
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,959
good choice

274
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,760
uh of course

275
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,399
moxie says that these things are

276
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
difficult and complex and and to some

277
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
extent impossible perhaps

278
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
and then there's matrix and then there's

279
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
the fetiverse and there's like plenty of

280
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
federated decentralized protocols

281
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,600
that are able to innovate right are able

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
to move on are able to uh add things uh

283
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
you know have multiple clients that are

284
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,560
not tightly controlled by a single

285
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
organization can have multiple servers

286
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
that are controlled not by a single uh

287
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
organization and yet they move on they

288
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
they add features they uh make make

289
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
exciting things right and of course

290
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
neither matrix or whatever's are exactly

291
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
in the same niche as signal

292
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
but they are still an example of of

293
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,279
protocols that um that are um

294
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
able to do this right

295
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,920
uh

296
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
another thing that was mentioned in his

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
talk at 3633

298
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
uh was reliability as a reason for

299
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
centralization right he gave this

300
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
convoluted example of

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
oh no what if one server goes down and

302
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
then pulls all the servers down together

303
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
and that's a weird example to give if

304
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
you're if you're talking about a

305
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
federated service because

306
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
i don't know about you but if i if an

307
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
email server goes down somewhere

308
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
randomly

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
in the world and i'm pretty sure this

310
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
happens all the time that doesn't really

311
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,959
affect my ability to use email unless it

312
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
is my email server or the email server

313
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
that my account is on or the person that

314
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,920
i'm talking to right so

315
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
it is

316
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,959
it is interesting to me that

317
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,440
that the argument of reliability is used

318
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
in the context of a centralized service

319
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,959
which is

320
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,640
in effect the monoculture right

321
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
monoculture

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
monocultures are not resilient

323
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
monocultures tend to have uh tend to

324
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
have problems uh

325
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
because they are a monoculture

326
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,480
whereas a decentralized ecosystem of of

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
servers and services that talk to each

328
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,000
other but are not run by the same

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
organization are not using exactly the

330
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
same software

331
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
tends to be a little bit more resilient

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
even if some part of them of those

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
servers are always perhaps uh perhaps

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
down right

335
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,399
and

336
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,079
finally for this part

337
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,200
uh as much as moxie likes to use email

338
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
as an example of a protocols

339
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
quote-unquote stuck in the 90s

340
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
the fact that it is a protocol that has

341
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
been serving us for half a century

342
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,120
already

343
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
like email has been with us for half a

344
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,480
century

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
is there here is is here anyone

346
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,839
who is older than

347
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,279
that okay that's a bad question don't

348
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,079
don't

349
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,600
ignore ignore that ignore that let's

350
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
ignore that

351
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
um

352
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
so the fact that this is a protocol that

353
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,480
has been serving us and serving as well

354
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
for what it what is used for uh for half

355
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
a century that's that's some staying

356
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,839
power

357
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
right meanwhile we can i think all

358
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
imagine or remember uh many many

359
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,279
different uh protocols and systems and

360
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
like centralized services that went away

361
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,279
uh um over the last uh

362
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
10 years 20 years right

363
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,800
like text secure thank you wait oh no

364
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320

thank you um no like google plus for

366
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,560
example right anybody remembers google

367
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
plus

368
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,920
yes anybody remembers google plus fondly

369

370
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839

signal and it's about moxie well that

378

um so the comment is and that was about

389
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,519
blocking libra signal

390
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
uh from using signals servers right the

391
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
comment is i'm not okay with liver

392
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
signal using our servers and i'm not

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
okay with liver signal using the name

394
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
signal

395
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
okay fair

396
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
you're free to use our source code for

397
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
whatever you would like under the terms

398
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
of the license but you're not entitled

399
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
to use our name and the service that we

400
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,760
run

401
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,959
if you think running servers is

402
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
difficult and expensive you're right ask

403
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
yourself why you feel entitled for us uh

404
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,040
for us to run them for your product

405
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,240
um

406
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
i have an answer to this actually uh

407
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
that i came up with finally and the

408
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,040
answer is again

409
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,079
who here has pushed talked conversed

410
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
suggested etc people to use signal

411
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,639
and how much work was this

412
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
who here was paid by signal to do this

413
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,959
thank you

414
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,600
again i rest my case right

415
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
this is

416
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
the point the point is this is an

417
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
ecosystem right this is a community

418
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
and

419
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
i think

420
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
makers of signal try to

421
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
treat this as a product and customers

422
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
yes we get the service for free that is

423
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,120
absolutely true many of us donate to to

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
to signal also right who has donated to

425
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,959
signal

426
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,920
yay

427
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
okay right um so not everyone gets this

428
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
for free uh but there's also a lot of

429
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,959
work that we have put into

430
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,079
making signal what it is today

431
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,240
right this is not a

432
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
one-sided

433
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
thing this is not a one-sided uh this is

434
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
not a you know company that makes a

435
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,920
product that people use or not use right

436
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,000
this is a this is supposedly a community

437
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,079
this is a free and open software product

438
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
i mean project and this is one of the

439
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
reasons why many of us have been

440
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
suggesting it pushing it etc etc etc to

441
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
other

442
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,959
uh to other people and that is free work

443
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
right that that uh that we're

444
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,680
donating to uh to signal

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
um

446
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
another thing um and another thing uh

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
another thing is

448
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,240
another side of centralization is not

449
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
just the federated side right it's not

450
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
just like can i run my own server but

451
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
it's also

452
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
can i run a different client for signal

453
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,639
like liver signal right like whisper

454
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,480
fish on selfish os which

455
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
like there is no official uh signal

456
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,759
client for for selfish shots right like

457
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,560
many other uh uh

458
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
many other potential um i think there

459
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,399
was a molly im uh which was also a a

460
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,880
signal compatible client right it isn't

461
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
anymore unfortunately uh and

462
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,440
so

463
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
the other side of centralization is the

464
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,560
client side right

465
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
i would like to be able to choose a

466
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
different client right why would i like

467
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,880
to maybe perhaps be able to choose a

468
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
different

469
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
signal

470
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,560
client especially on the desktop

471
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
i don't know

472
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
i don't know

473
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
i remember sitting and staring at this

474
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
screen for five minutes once

475
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
like five minutes there was no major

476
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
update it just it just decided you know

477
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,199
what

478
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,880
we have time

479
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
it's fine

480
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
right no rush

481
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
your messages will arrive eventually you

482
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
know let's be a little bit zen about

483
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,199
this

484
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,160
um

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,359
so

486
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
i would like to be able to choose a

487
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,079
different client because maybe a

488
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
different client will have also

489
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,840
additional features

490
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
right

491
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
wait innovation can happen in a

492
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559
situation where there are other players

493
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,679
that is shocking to me i think right

494
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
but also i would like to be able to

495
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
choose a different client in a situation

496
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,679
where the client that i am using has

497
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
removed some features or modif or

498
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
changed its behavior in a way that i

499
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
find annoying right

500
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
let's say uh a feature gets removed that

501
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
you relied on for whatever reason right

502
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
signal developers decide you know what

503
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,760
it's it's too difficult to keep it in

504
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,240
the in the code right now for us

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
uh but why block this ability

506
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
like why block other developers from

507
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
from doing this right why say you know

508
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
what it's more it's too difficult for us

509
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
but hey you know go ahead why not right

510
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,640
it's not not big of a deal for us

511
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
uh no you you cannot do this right or

512
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,840
let's say a a a

513
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
signal client removes a translation of

514
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
like in the language in your native

515
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,840
language right and you cannot you do not

516
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
have the option of choosing a different

517
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,720
client that maybe perhaps supports this

518
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
particular translation suddenly

519
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
depending on on your ability to use

520
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
different other languages you might not

521
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
be able to use uh signal signal fully

522
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,039
the third thing that i'm going to say is

523
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
again signal desktop signal desktop is

524
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
the bane of my existence sometimes

525
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
and

526
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,600
it is obviously an electron app so you

527
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
cannot run it on a

528
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,600
on a machine that has less than four

529
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
gigabytes of ram dedicated specifically

530
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
to it

531
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
right you have to have enough ram for

532
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
the operating system you have to have an

533
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
up run for everything else you're doing

534
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
you're doing which will be about a gig

535
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
and then you have to have four gigs for

536
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
for signals specifically right

537
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,679
um

538
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,120
uh

539
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,080
but

540
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,480
like okay that that's fine i guess i

541
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,039
guess those those images uh are heavy

542
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,000
and uh and and all of that um

543
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,960
but

544
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
why why can't we have a native client

545
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
right why can't we have a client that is

546
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
not based on a browser and is usually

547
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
tracking this browser what two versions

548
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
behind

549
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
how much time

550
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
10 minutes okay i'll be i'll be wrapping

551
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
up so that we can have more questions uh

552
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
why can't we have a client that is not

553
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,440
tracking

554
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,559
a uh a browser a a very well-known uh uh

555
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
um let's say target for people who might

556
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
want to uh might want to do bad things

557
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,880
so

558
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
the fact that signal basically tracks a

559
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,919
browser

560
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,840
view versions behind means that there

561
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
are probably known vulnerabilities

562
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
that are fixed in the browser but then

563
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
they have to be

564
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
fixed in electron and then they get

565
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
fixed in signal right there's a bigger

566
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,159
window of opportunity here for uh for uh

567
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,559
for uh let's say malicious behavior and

568
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
i would like to have a native client

569
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,640
instead right that is that does not have

570
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,000
this um this particular problem right

571
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,360
but

572
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
what

573
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,000
uh the bright side is at least we got

574
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
stickers

575
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
right so i guess that's good

576
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,679
uh one last one last uh uh

577
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,000
thing i will throw at you before i will

578
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
invite people to to crowd the one

579
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
microphone i guess one one

580
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,760
uh

581
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
is

582
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
feature creep feature creep is real

583
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
right

584
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,799
and

585
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
i am i started wondering a while ago is

586
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,919
signal still a a an encrypted messaging

587
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,640
app or is it becoming a social network

588
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
and the reason why i started asking this

589
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
is because you know groups are becoming

590
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
big and and i mean it's great that

591
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,679
groups can be great and they're huge but

592
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
i feel like more and more features are

593
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,960
slowly

594
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
uh being added that gravitate signal

595
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
towards a social

596
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,880
social network

597
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
more than an i am and these are two

598
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,640
different

599
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
tools

600
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
and i need signal for example me

601
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,000
personally again my opinion guy from the

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
internet uh i need signal to be the

603
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,159
encrypted i am that it was supposed to

604
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,600
be from the start

605
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,240
because if it stops being a good i am to

606
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
become a good social network i will have

607
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
to switch i will have to have a good i

608
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
am somehow and i will not have this

609
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
or nobody will have this opportunity

610
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
because those clients are you know the

611
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
only the blessed clients can be

612
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,840
can be used so my question

613
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,760
is at so at which point the feature

614
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,400
creep becomes too much right and and

615
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
maybe maybe it would make sense to uh

616
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,840
focus um more on

617
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,559
uh you know making this work

618
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,120
allowing some um allowing some

619
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,760
independent native clients to uh

620
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
to emerge and and and and thrive

621
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
uh instead of uh

622
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,159
instead of focusing on feature creep

623
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
i guess one can hope that briar will get

624
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,760
better uh and and and stuff but yeah so

625
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,320
anybody has opinions

626
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,879
yes please

627
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
yay

628
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,799
i wasn't wrong i thought people will

629
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,840
have opinions now let's see if the

630
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,000
opinions are about signal or me

631
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,799
so

632
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,679
oh my great reviews uh so i would like

633
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
to add furthermore that if you go to

634
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,280
signal webpage and press get up it gets

635
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,679
you to google play or app store and

636
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,400
that's the only way to get the

637
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
app

638
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,640
you cannot just download the app

639
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
or build it and

640
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
okay you could build it

641
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
the thing is it's not distributed by

642
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,039
android it includes

643
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,919
google services and not everyone is okay

644
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,200
with them

645
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,039
and as we know

646
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,080
signal blocks third party

647
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
clients so

648
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,840
yeah yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna uh i i

649
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
will vehemently agree with you

650
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,799
with one uh with one uh different like

651
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,919
with one caveat is that

652
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,840
you can download the app i think it's

653
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
signal.org slash app no slash android

654
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
something

655
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,200
if you know the url you can download the

656
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
the apk sometimes ago some time ago i

657
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,799
was trying and i couldn't anybody

658
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,230
remembers the url

659
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,360
[Music]

660
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,039
slash android apk there you go so

661
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,120
yeah but like it's it's like in the

662
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
basement the second door to the left

663
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
there's a tiger you know

664
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,679
this kind of stuff right meanwhile the

665
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,480
evil telegram lets you have third

666
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
parties lets you download from wherever

667
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
you want even

668
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,520
telegram itself releases on

669
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
f droid and they're okay with that yeah

670
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,279
absolutely

671
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
i would love to see signal and i've draw

672
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,200
it but please please yes also leave some

673
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
time for the next

674
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,080
thanks

675
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,679
so um several comments so there's um

676
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,279
there's wire

677
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,400
which i believe is generally they they

678
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
they're very engaged with the mls

679
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,760
project mls is messaging their security

680
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
project it's essentially

681
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
trying to come up with uh anyway

682
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,840
if you're interested in this stuff you

683
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,520
should know about mls

684
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
um the and

685
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,039
the

686
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,200
there's um

687
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
okay but anyway but about signal itself

688
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,679
the

689
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
i mean moxie has a certain position in

690
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,559
whatever

691
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
whatever it is but the

692
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,720
my objection was much more narrow was

693
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
always specifically that um

694
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
moxie was complaining about the the

695
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,679
upgrade problem essentially that was his

696
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,360
core objection was that he wasn't going

697
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,679
to be able to upgrade the thing

698
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,240
and that the nature of the software is

699
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
complicated enough that he didn't need

700
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,000
to be able to upgrade it the second

701
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
statement here is true it's absolutely

702
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,279
true that he did need to be able to

703
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,200
upgrade it he didn't need to be able to

704
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
kill off third-party clients to do

705
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
something complicated that's just going

706
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,960
to be the inherent and being able to

707
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,960
change cryptography can you get

708
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,159
the thing is is that if you want a

709
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,760
perfect example of somebody who does

710
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
this and makes it work is tour

711
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
yeah they do have an upgrade path and

712
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
there's others with complicated complex

713
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,120
upgrade paths

714
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
yeah there are ways there are ways to do

715
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,159
this right yes it adds a little bit of

716
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,000
complexity but it is possible it doesn't

717
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
stop you completely from doing it and i

718
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,520
agree

719
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,640
yes next well add another thing

720
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,520
i like your shirt thank you

721
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,440
and also i don't like having to use my

722
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,720
phone number to use signal yes and

723
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,840
the reason i don't like that is because

724
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,760
i don't want to use the same identity

725
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,919
for all of my communications

726
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
and i find that people are picking up

727
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
signal more and more we're using it for

728
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,559
all sorts of things we're using it for

729
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
socializing we're using it for work

730
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
we're using it for this and the other

731
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,360
i want to have different personas

732
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
and fully obtaining new phone numbers is

733
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,640
hard fully fully agreed uh but since now

734
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,480
i'm i'm i'm on the receiving end of this

735
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,840
i will

736
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
like defend it a little bit there is now

737
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
a way to migrate

738
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,200
uh between phone numbers at least so yay

739
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
uh and there's a and there is now uh

740
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
there i think signal is slowly moving

741
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,159
towards a phone less identity and

742
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,320
they're like let's hope this happens but

743
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,120
uh

744
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,919
yeah

745
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
it could have been prioritized maybe

746
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,360
yes

747
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
so

748
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,760
while i agree that signal does have some

749
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,720
weak points i want to play the devil's

750
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
advocate a bit and say that i don't

751
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
think the comparison with email is fair

752
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,919
at all

753
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,080
moxie used it i took it straight from

754
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
his top yeah straight from his blog post

755
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,880
yes

756
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
but like

757
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,799
from

758
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,520
a concrete perspective email evolved in

759
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
a very different system

760
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,480
and we only still use email because all

761
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,039
the alternatives somewhat dies

762
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,520
so we will only know what

763
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,399
which messaging system will survive will

764
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,679
survive in 50 years in 50 years

765
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,399
and

766
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,480
also another small point i want to make

767
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,559
is that there is these

768
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,679
ugly trusts that truth that

769
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,679
cryptography is hard

770
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
and usability matters

771
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
and signal did manage to make a usable

772
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
product with excellent cryptography and

773
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
that's why i use it yeah yeah no

774
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,640
absolutely we agree

775
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
as i said at the beginning i appreciate

776
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,840
the product i use the product i i

777
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,919
strongly you know suggest the product to

778
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
like the signal to many people but

779
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
just we need to air this

780
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,480
stuff and moxie didn't give us the

781
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,159
chance so

782
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,679
i'm a stand-in

783
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,279
yes so fun fact uh people really think

784
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,919
that uh like because of the stuff with

785
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,159
libra signal a while ago that

786
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,279
uh

787
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,320
third-party clients really aren't

788
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
allowed but there's a lot of them right

789
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,039
now for there's gurk uh who's closer to

790
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
the mic sorry

791
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,559
uh

792
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,159
gerk is a

793
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,159
a desktop client written in rust for the

794
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,799
terminal there's also signal cli and

795
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,159
signal d

796
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,440
um

797
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
then there's this other guy with

798
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
molly.im

799
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
yeah a bunch of forks with like

800
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,320
different

801
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,120
um i i also helped maintain a uh

802
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,919
uh

803
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,919
signal client

804
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,000
for the command line and rust

805
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
they're all a huge pain because in fact

806
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,799
the ecosystem does keep moving um but

807
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
they're not as frowned upon as uh they

808
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,679
used to be an also moxie isn't that

809
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
signal anymore without like

810
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
many of the things that have been taken

811
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,440
taken for given how for a while have

812
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
changed

813
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,679
also yeah hopefully usernames launch

814
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
before fusion happens

815
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,840
um

816
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,799
but

817
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,520
the social aspects aren't going to like

818
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
go less there's a bunch of stuff in the

819
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,679
code for like uh stories and stuff like

820
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,880
that so yeah thank you uh one more

821
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
response to the previous question in the

822
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,000
blog post uh moxie clearly says that

823
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,159
there's no technical reason why signal

824
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,240
cannot be federated uh um it is a choice

825
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
it is a like the protocol is designed to

826
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
be federated it is

827
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
like there's a choice that blocks that

828
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,960
yes we're in overtime so this is the

829
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
last one sorry yay can we have two can

830
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,279
we have two no three otherwise i get

831
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,120
three

832
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
let's have two

833
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
okay but otherwise there's sufficient

834
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,919
time after this so please

835
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,080
please be quick i'm just wondering what

836
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,880
will happen to the clear earth which

837
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,000
currently

838
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,080
ships a fork of signal and or even calls

839
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
it clear signal or something like that

840
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
so if moxie does the same thing as he

841
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,039
did five or six years ago with libre

842
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,320
signal he will also shut them down

843
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,600
i wonder if that happens we'll see

844
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
you had a question

845
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
be quick i i i just wanted to say

846
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,960
quickly that my main gripe with signal

847
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
is that it's too much of a silicon

848
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,520
valley tech bro vibe to it thank you you

849
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,440
just called it a product i have a
