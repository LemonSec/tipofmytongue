which i don't have um

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,080
fighting infectious diseases is

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,759
ages old and we still do it the same way

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,960
we identify people who got sick

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
we trace people who were in contact and

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
isolate them that's it it was so

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
for the plague

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
it was so for the spanish flu and it's

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,119
the same

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,159
when fighting

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,479
the current pandemic

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,759
but

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
in the old days

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
you knew everyone you met

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,720
you didn't forget them

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
nowadays you meet a lot of people

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
and most of them

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
you don't know

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
and if you're as old as i am

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,140
the rest you don't remember

47

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
please do two things try two things

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400

one is

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
please warn contacts

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
that you don't remember because you're

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
old

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
and secondly

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
see if you can help contact freezing

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
experts

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
in doing their work

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,120
so what we did

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
stupid this is kind of stupid i am

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,360
i had to stay at home

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
and

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,319
i was watching television to a press

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,360
conference on april 6

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,680
2020 and there was this minister of

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
health who was telling this story about

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
cell phones knowing exactly how far they

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
were apart with bluetooth

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
and

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
that was one of those fine moments that

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
i used twitter to the max

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
and it became even funnier because he

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
started an epithon

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
a what an appathon what the is that

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,519
yeah what we did we had a weekend

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
we prepared that in two weeks

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
and over the weekend

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
we tested seven apps

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
available on the market two of those

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
i don't say that often

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
were rolled out in countries

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
two separate european member states

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
european union member state

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
um but after the weekend

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
seven apps contested after the weekend

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,640
we concluded none of them was good

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,519
enough

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
so i made a lot of fun about that

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,879
and i called it um to say in this the

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
hoax from the techno optimism

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
the high mouse was detecting optimism

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
so um

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
um let me know

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,519
well i said i called him and i called

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,040
some others

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
that were um to say the least a bit

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,799
sceptical on the internet on social

100
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
media

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,200
and i said if you know best

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
join me

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
and he did

104
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,799
well

105
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,680
there are some non-negotiables here

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,959
first

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
privacy is secured

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
second one security is non-negotiable

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
and third you know if you build

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
something it should be available to

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
everybody

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,759
and then once that of course okay

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
and then there were also a whole bunch

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
of people

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
um

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
what we did

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
instead of doing it with people that

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
stared out of windows

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,240
sorry

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
we did it also with people from the

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
outside

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
so i had the honor

123
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
to work with a team that would never

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
work with me that would always work

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
against me yep

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,639
amongst which are large names

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
and i said well

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
you may say that

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
i should take privacy

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,160
i'm

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
serious serious

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
and i should take security seriously

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,479
i should take accessibility seriously

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,120
but those are my failures too

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
so we aimed for the highest

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
and now this

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
ah

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,090
please work

139
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,140
[Music]

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
this is one of

141
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
our blind

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
testos

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
testers

144
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
we had blind people working on the team

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
we had blind people testing everything

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
we did

147
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,639
on a daily or weekly basis this was

148
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
at the same speed

149
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
she wrapped the screen

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
which is a lot quicker than we would

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
read it

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
she just heard it so everything we did

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
we tested to the max

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
and yes

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
it is fully accessible what we developed

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
we were the first government website

157
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
with no cookies at all

158
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,520
yeah that actually oh

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
that that was actually a kind of a thing

160
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
because normally you have to have

161
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
cookies on the government website and we

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
promised not to track anybody so

163
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
what you said is if you do cookies then

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
basically you're tracking people let's

165
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
not do that

166
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,440
yeah that's true um so let's not do that

167
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
um so then people called me working

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
against government standards so i went

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,400
like yes i know

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,919
and that was basically the end of the

171
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,479
discussion we did a lot of other things

172
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,759
uh some were

173
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
basically part of the framework that we

174
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,199
used but

175
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,800
for instance

176
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
one of the things that we did we made it

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
a crime

178
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
if you try to force somebody to use this

179
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
app

180
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
and there are only few countries that

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
that did so um

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,880
you have to exchange keys well if you

183
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,639
sort them by alphabet

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
you basically have a way that you can't

185
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,759
raise that where these keys are coming

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,720
from

187
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,919
and

188
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
we made sure that the municipal health

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
services couldn't really see anything

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,479
about

191
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
um about if somebody was really

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
uploading so you're it's okay that if

193
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
you're uploading keys or saying yes i am

194
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
uploading keys it's okay to lie so that

195
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
you remain anonymous and we had a lot of

196
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
privacy features built in

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
uh that basically

198
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
yeah

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
helped out a big time one of the fun

200
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
things was as well and um we

201
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
underestimated that one a little bit we

202
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
may we didn't make any backups because

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,440
backups is data that you can keep

204
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,479
keep on

205
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
for instance google drives and that type

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
of stuff you don't want that so then

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,840
some people lost their phones they went

208
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
like yeah i've lost my keys as well yep

209
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
that's true so we can't recover that

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
nope you can't

211
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
so um that that was one of the things

212
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
and if there's abuse uh allowed me to

213
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,839
have a team to go after people

214
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,799
that tried to be funny and say like okay

215
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,560
let's see if we can trace people

216
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
then

217
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
we also had to assess okay

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
what's the risk really and who are we

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
fighting against and basically

220
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
there were some people within the

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
government that said like you're

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
fighting state actors

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
good luck with that

224
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,279
and um

225
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
very focal people i can basically make

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
it very easy to say

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
everybody hates us

228
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
and that's what you have to obscure

229
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
against

230
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,900
the next one thank you

231
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,160
[Music]

232
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,120
then we did something else

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
one of the things to gain trust is to

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
show that things are okay how can you

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
show things are okay by showing the

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
researchers that have been done in that

237
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
so all the pen tests code reviews etc

238
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
have been sent to parliament and made

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
publicly available

240
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
that was really the first time i

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
believed that that ever happened in

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
within the dutch government and

243
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
proactively not wait for a foia request

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
do it proactively

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
um the verification

246
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,959
that is honestly something that i didn't

247
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
do but derek william van ghulik who is

248
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,279
here somewhere as well

249
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,040
thought of

250
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,920
but if you publish code how do i prove

251
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
that that code

252
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
is really the same software that is

253
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
blended on your cell phone so we have

254
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,480
made the process

255
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
to certify that by notary

256
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,040
so that um well

257
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
i think most of you wouldn't trust the

258
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
government fully

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
so the only thing to do that is how can

260
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
i show that the github code

261
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
is the same code as in the apple app

262
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
store

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
having a proof a notary proof

264
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
that

265
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,440
compiling that code leads to the app

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
that's in the app store

267
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
yeah

268
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,079
well

269
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,279
opening that all up basically helps you

270
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
to prove that you're really up for good

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
and one of the funny things was when

272
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
we passed the law in parliament

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
privacy and security were not a concern

274
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
anymore because they had all the

275
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
documentations there

276
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
and we were transparent to the max how

277
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
many people were

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
contacting

279
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
the public health institutes because

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
they were warned

281
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
we published that we publish that every

282
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
day daily on a daily basis

283
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
all the scientific research into does it

284
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
work or not

285
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
we published

286
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,760
every single

287
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,720
research report we got

288
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
so everything we did was not only open

289
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,200
by code

290
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
open by process

291
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
but also opened by everything we got

292
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
from research or

293
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,959
reports so we know

294
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
we used used we stopped it we stopped

295
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
the app because it wasn't needed anymore

296
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
people didn't think we would we stopped

297
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
it but we knew

298
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
we were using it

299
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,720
and when we stopped it

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,959
we hired auditors to

301
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,040
verify that we really stopped the app

302
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
and not only the code is open

303
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
the designs are open the documentation

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
is open the ux research is open the

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,839
translations are open

306
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,399
and made by the public also or improved

307
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
by the public

308
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,920
and all discussions were open

309
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
so

310
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,120
press had to get used to it

311
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
we published the first code

312
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
and the morning papers opened with

313
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
first

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
app

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,959
version

316
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,440
uh published which was not true

317
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
it was just the first the first commit

318
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
it was the first commit

319
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
press that he could use to have to get

320
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
used to

321
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
doing that um

322
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
we had designs

323
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
for the icons

324
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
and yellow prince one of the main design

325
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
designers for uber for example

326
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
did that and did that on twitter

327
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
one of the things that i believe in for

328
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,639
years is that making mistakes is cool

329
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
because if things go wrong

330
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,040
you can do better next time and learn

331
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
but um

332
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
you can

333
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
also you know by going by mistakes um

334
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
assess risks easier it's far easier to

335
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,839
say what can go wrong than um

336
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
to say what is the risk

337
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,440
so

338
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
i introduced the failure mode effect

339
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
analysis as a risk assessment

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
methodology and now like two years later

341
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
people before they call me say

342
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,240
automatically yeah we should do an fmea

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
so they already know that whatever

344
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,560
question they are going to ask if it's a

345
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
bit complex you have you start to think

346
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
on how you do things wrong

347
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,240
um and it helps oh one last thing it

348
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
helps also in in making design more

349
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,720
robust

350
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
and uh of course you don't punish people

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
um you're just being proud that's one

352
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
good thing of wrong

353
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
by the way one just one yeah that's only

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
one

355
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
is that um

356
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,320
whenever something went wrong

357
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
one would say okay this is my mistake i

358
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
own it

359
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
um instead of go like how could you do

360
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,000
this wrong

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,680
and that gives of course the confidence

362
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
that it works then i was lucky i was

363
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
just there and um

364
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
i um saw on uh on the news that uh one

365
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,839
of the subsidiaries of the ministry

366
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,199
basically uh had a very basic issue in

367
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,040
their website url manipulation

368
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
so why wasn't this in the pen there so i

369
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,160
wrote around an email hey hon

370
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
don't you people do pen tests in this

371
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,959
building

372
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
um so yes they did yes of course they

373
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
did and then i looked at it and

374
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
basically didn't contain the test they

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,199
did most painters are basically a list

376
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,839
of things that the researcher thinks and

377
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
thinks is not okay so when we started

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
with

379
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
procurement for pen tests i realized i

380
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
need to be able to follow the entire

381
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
process so what we did

382
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
is basically have a

383
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
standards if you find something i want

384
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
to understand how serious it is not by a

385
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,480
thermometer or whatever no

386
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
by a standard

387
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
and if we're talking about testing let's

388
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
at first at least do the hours top 10 on

389
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,800
the

390
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,519
wstg or the um

391
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,240
the

392
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
mscstg

393
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,680
because then at least i know which tests

394
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
have been done

395
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
and yes it's okay to do more about that

396
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
and then of course we wrote the report

397
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,320
will be public so we asked 10 companies

398
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,560
um to help us six of them said like oh

399
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,360
no with public reports we don't

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
so that was kind of interesting

401
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
and

402
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,759
recently we adopted the policy that our

403
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
internal pen testers do a pen test and

404
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,399
an external auditor will verify the pen

405
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
test by the documents alone so they need

406
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
to be written in such a way

407
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
that the auditor can understand each and

408
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
every test that has been done

409
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
and i you see a car here if you have an

410
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,199
old car you have to have it inspected

411
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
once a year

412
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
or else you're not allowed to drive it

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in the netherlands that's basically what

414
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
we do and then some companies go like no

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,199
no no pentest are magic no they're not

416
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,399
most issues are with the basics and then

417
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,440
the vaccinations came liberation at last

418
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,079
how do they

419
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
register this factionation

420
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,759
thing to the

421
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,480
hr so that the national public institute

422
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
of public health um

423
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,199
knows about the vaccination and

424
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,360
then we discussed eight months of eight

425
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,839
weeks before the first vaccination round

426
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
started that around 15 percent of

427
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
doctors don't use this system that can

428
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
report about vaccinations to the

429
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,799
national

430
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,240
government

431
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,319
after they have been done so we just had

432
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
eight weeks six weeks no we had three

433
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
weeks it was december 15th

434
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,880
so what did we do well we were at lunch

435
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
so some people started chatting about it

436
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
after that question like oh

437
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,080
then some people started to escalate

438
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
then we stopped the blah

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
yeah then some people escalated

440
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
we stopped hiring

441
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
and then um i said like okay i'll help

442
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
you out here so let's start a project on

443
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
this and then the manager came into my

444
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
office and said like

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
it might be the case that the ministry

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
of defense starts to vaccinate and then

447
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
a project needs to have a code name so

448
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
when like okay if this is really what

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,440
you're worried about

450
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,120
meet my cat branny

451
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,799
and when i cuddle her i call her brani

452
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,840
banani so the project was called biryani

453
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,840
banani

454
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,400
then we went to um basically i

455
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,120
i found a manual phone and we found all

456
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,919
sorts of hacker spaces and

457
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,390
basically said like help

458
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,720
[Music]

459
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
so they came to help and then uh on the

460
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
are you busy on a project yeah is that

461
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
more important than covet no then you

462
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
work for me

463
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
um and on the one with okay

464
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
um

465
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
next

466
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
so before you come to the egg just run

467
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
into a supermarket and make a picture of

468
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,679
a bunch of bananas

469
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
so we built a website brownie banani

470
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,200
dota now

471
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
this will be the webshop for all within

472
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,520
us and behind that was the vaccination

473
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,160
registration

474
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
system so if you wonder why i have a

475
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,600
t-shirt with brba

476
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
you cannot

477
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
name a formal official government

478
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
website brandywine.net

479
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
but you can name i think you can be a

480
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,559
dot nl

481
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
and in official documentation to the

482
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
dutch parliament

483
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
it has a total different acronym

484
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
we made up afterwards

485
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,120
in dutch

486
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
so this if

487
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,039
in

488
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,840
if you look back in government files uh

489
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
if you log

490
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,200
the parliament files if you look back on

491
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
technical briefings they'll use brba.nel

492
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,559
so now you know it's about cats

493
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
it's um hiro

494
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
brani and kaiko

495
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
and kaiko it can can

496
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
complain a lot so i call her kaiko the

497
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
psycho as well and this is how it looks

498
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,879
in a government system

499
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,120
and hero and afterwards what we did

500
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
everything and anytime we met for

501
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
example a nurse in rotterdam that helped

502
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,720
us

503
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,679
we asked do you have a cat

504
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
and now every part of the system has a

505
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,760
cat name in it from one of the

506
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
participants in

507
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,559
working with us

508
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
um some people thought it was a stupid

509
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
idea like that manager and then the

510
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,640
minister said like you know what let's

511
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
stick to the cat names that's kind of

512
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,280
cool

513
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,240
so

514
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
i don't want to

515
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
i got to

516
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
so

517
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
if you now see red hat for example using

518
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,799
animal names i don't see anything

519
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,520
no that's it i stopped it um

520
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
yeah

521
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
one of the things that i did with all

522
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
the projects

523
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
is use hardware security modules

524
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
for those that don't know what is that

525
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
it's a quick

526
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,679
cryptography thing and ron always says

527
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,400
it's a big working prison for keys that

528
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
will be born there and die there

529
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
but the thing the issue with this is

530
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,640
that um it takes a couple of weeks

531
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240
before you have them and we had only

532
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,320
three weeks so somebody said you know

533
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
what use a software hsm a software

534
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,879
hardware security module

535
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
no

536
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
on windows

537
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
no

538
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
so i found mendel and said like okay i

539
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
don't know what to do but think of

540
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
something so um the next morning

541
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,919
mendel said like you know what we could

542
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,720
do we could do an hsm on on a yob key so

543
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,559
we're like oh yeah that sounds cool you

544
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,360
should try that and go go do that and he

545
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,640
said like nope

546
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,360
i already did that so there we were on

547
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
january 2nd in a data center

548
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
putting

549
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
ubikeys into a

550
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
into servers with the ceremony that the

551
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
william from hulick wrote himself in i

552
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
believe four or five hours

553
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,440
doing an official

554
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
hsm ceremony with everything and and

555
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,799
made with together with anion and made

556
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
the total chaos out of it but that's a

557
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
whole different lecture

558
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
oh yeah and then of course the

559
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,720
credentials had been distributed um

560
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,919
so that's

561
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,200
you heard could have heard that

562
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
yesterday already but we used the army

563
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
for that

564
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
and um that was kind of cool because

565
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
within two hours you started to see on

566
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
linkedin all happy nurses and doctors

567
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,640
that all of a sudden could um

568
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
could log into the system because with

569
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
hospitals we've got 118 in the

570
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
netherlands

571
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,760
so 180 times two credentials that's easy

572
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
you know for the defense to distribute

573
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
but

574
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,799
then i asked on

575
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,000
how many

576
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,159
other doctors are there that would need

577
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159
the system

578
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
and then we were silent again

579
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
and then rome looked at me and went like

580
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,159
okay i declare this that we are not in

581
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,520
control

582
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,400
let's have lunch

583
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,880
so then then

584
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
the anions and mendel and and thought of

585
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
things again like um you know what

586
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
um let's use the the the this card that

587
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,960
doctors have to log in and then once

588
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,159
that

589
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,240
at that time i was responsible for that

590
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
car it's a car distributed by the

591
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,200
ministry

592
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,679
to doctors to lock into systems to

593
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
identify patients and

594
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
communicate securely

595
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
and we didn't have an open source

596
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,159
implementation how to interact with that

597
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,520
card

598
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
we now have

599
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,440
it's the aussie card and the project has

600
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
been called

601
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
and

602
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
[Music]

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
yes

604
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,600
then people started like okay we're we

605
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
grown bigger as a team so you have to

606
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
have a security team

607
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
so you will be rdo security i mean like

608
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
no so i thought like what is important

609
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,279
in life well cats and indonesian food

610
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
so i like um

611
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,919
indonesian food a lot so we call the

612
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,720
team red team in

613
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
indonesian which is tim abbang

614
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
so our team is now called timabang and

615
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,120
i had a nice photo of kaiko the zyko and

616
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
we transformed that into a logo and then

617
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
of course we did all the marketing and

618
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
the branding that you need to do within

619
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
the ministry

620
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
um

621
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
almost everything we do now is open

622
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,440
source and on github

623
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,559
and we had the first minister worldwide

624
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,840
to do a commit on kiddo

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,039
never done before

626
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,960
how many

627
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
repos do we have now

628
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
someone

629
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
and anyone doesn't even know

630
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
dozens

631
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,200
more than more than 50 public repos yeah

632
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
and then

633
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
something else happened and you probably

634
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,720
know when you traveled within europe

635
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,159
or had to enter a

636
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
a promise showing a qr code

637
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,919
we were asked

638
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,400
to try out what was needed

639
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,000
if you would ask people

640
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,919
if they were tested

641
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,799
negatively or not when entering

642
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,520
for example a restaurant and in a pilot

643
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
phase

644
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,240
um and that was before the

645
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
european dcc

646
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
we started before

647
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
and we said if we do it the same way we

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,559
do contact racing

649
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,039
and for example

650
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,480
you don't want people to be linked

651
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,799
between two events

652
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,559
so you walk from one restaurant to

653
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,799
another you do not want to be

654
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,279
linkable between the two

655
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,760
you do not want people to be able to

656
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
register that you there

657
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
and and you wanted to accessible too so

658
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,919
if you when i skip something

659
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,520
i go to this

660
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
we developed

661
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,760
a dutch qr code

662
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,320
on the left is the european qr code

663
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
within it all the data itself about

664
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
vaccination test and recovery

665
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
the dutch qr code which is now stopped

666
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,200
by the way because it's not needed

667
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
anymore

668
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
has just the first letter of surname and

669
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,760
full name

670
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,240
and day and month of birth if you have

671
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,039
that code you are safe

672
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
not knowing who you are

673
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,960
not knowing why you have to not knowing

674
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
why you're safe

675
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,000
it's just

676
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,679
a proof

677
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,200
that you were

678
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
eligible to enter

679
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,799
so when we had our own qr code it had no

680
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,240
data not about why you were safe

681
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,799
and not about who you were

682
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,640
and we went at length doing that

683
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,159
we even added to the code we used

684
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,159
for example that if you were

685
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,720
safe because you had had a vaccine

686
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,039
you were saved for about six months

687
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,480
a test is 24 hour you didn't get

688
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,919
more than one done 24 hours in the qr

689
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
code so no one

690
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
could see if that was because of having

691
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
been tested

692
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
over having had a vaccination that's

693
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
what you get when working with hackers

694
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
and it is fair to say that especially

695
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,039
thanks to their venom from hylic that

696
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
the european list is smaller than they

697
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
initially wanted to do

698
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
so we developed

699
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
three apps

700
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,960
the holder app the scanner up the

701
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,440
scanner app for domestic use

702
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,840
and the scanner app

703
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,480
for international use

704
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
so we had

705
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,399
our own domestic qr and

706
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,200
based on how many people had queue as a

707
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
first name

708
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
you wouldn't show the queue

709
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,240
so when a first name

710
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
was not used too much in combination

711
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
with the last name for example

712
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
there wouldn't be a letter there would

713
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,000
be a dash

714
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,880
so we developed the apps

715
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
they were accessible tested and many

716
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
languages

717
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,799
no credentials

718
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
in the qr code

719
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,320
and just

720
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,960
first name last name

721
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,559
day of birth

722
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
and month of birth

723
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
and um

724
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
i say that again that's when you work

725
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
that's that's what you get when you work

726
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,799
for people who normally work against you

727
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,320
and you don't get a reason why the code

728
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
is not accepted you just get a

729
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,960
not valid

730
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,840
um

731
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,080
the portfolio behind this

732
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
and anian just said of over 50 public

733
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,159
repos

734
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
is huge

735
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
and built by

736
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
just a dozen

737
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
just some dozens of people

738
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,000
in the past two years

739
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,250
and that's what i have to say thank you

740
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:33,840
[Applause]

741
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,960
it has been a wonderful journey

742
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
and it

743
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
it's an honor to be

744
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,600
working with people like you

745
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,480
and people that normally work against me

746
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
now they work with me

747
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
and brought something on the table that

748
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,279
you normally would not expect

749
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,960
people would expect hackers bring

750
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
hackability

751
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,039
they bring privacy

752
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
they bring security and they bring it in

753
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,120
a way

754
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
that um

755
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,039
most of society wouldn't expect

756
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
so thank you

757
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
and there is someone here in the room

758
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
that managed to get a hammock

759
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
into the ministry

760
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,970
so he deserves his own slide

761
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:28,799
[Applause]

762
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,600

765
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,120
um

766
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
my fellow workers at the ministry didn't

767
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,000
always recognize what we were doing

768
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,840
but we started a book bounty at 1337

769
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,000
on the 25th of january 2021 which is

770
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
adds up to 42.

771
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,679
um

772
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,799
no one no one discovered that so it went

773
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,360
it it get into parliament and we did it

774
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,760
at specifically that time we started at

775
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
burke bounty

776
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279

and we had fun we had lots of fun

778
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,919
and the ministry the minister of justice

779
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,519
said

780
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,799
this is a team of wizards

781
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,320
with the

782
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,519
[Music]

783
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,840
heart at the right

784
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,919
place and still have fun

785
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,080
the soap dispensers at the ministry now

786
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,519
have stickers

787
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
stating that they are emptied at every

788
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,919
end of the day

789
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,360
and

790
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
there leads to herd immunity

791
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,799
um

792
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,039

00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,039
working in a place where you would

795
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,440
normally not expect them

796
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,960
and excel and do that together

797
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
what they're doing

811
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
you're not able to drive change

812
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,799
and have others do what they need to do

813
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,559
it's a

814
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,399
it's a block you should read about the

815

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,799
so we have some sample questions like

819
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,720
have you considered naming things after

820
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
dogs

um my minister said in parliament that

835
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,640
um source source code of the government

836
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
can be made public

837
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
should be made or can be made public

838
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,239
because the law states so and he just

839
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,000
demanded the source code for one of our

840
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,800
identity teams

841
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,720
in your app the call number check ad

859
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,640
with the email bounce then eventually we

860
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,400
reach out to you

861
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,320
and then bueno you promised us tickets

862
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
for mch yes we didn't get them yet don't

863
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
want to be

864
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,040
patient

865
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,920
no no no no no no no no no no

866
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
hold on hold on can you frame this as a

867
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,100
question please

868
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,960
[Applause]

869
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,079
when can we expect them

870
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,240
excuse me i didn't get a question when

871
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,040
can we expect them

872
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,280
as i have told you and mailed you

873
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,760
probably but i also told him

874
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,599
let me know where to send them and i

875
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,480
will send them and you never did and

876
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,359
okay

877
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,078
okay wait wait wait

878
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
maybe this this is good for a discussion

879
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
often there are a bit because outside

880
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
there are five tickets handed i have

881
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,920
that have been handed out to people so

882
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
um we

883
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,920
we did do what we promised

884
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,160
i i think it's best to come over after

885
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,240
the tour yeah yeah

886
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,960
we'll make something up probably

887
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
yeah for example

888
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
that's nice microphone in the front

889
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,200
please

890
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,920
it's not on oh yes it will come on just

891
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,440
keep on talking

892
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
yes

893
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,680
um my question is uh what assumptions

894
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,079
did you have about the other party it's

895
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,119
a question for both of you that got

896
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,119
invalidated when working together

897
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,240
okay for me the one that um

898
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,079
comes to mind first

899
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,440
is um

900
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,359
and and hope is there a good dutch to

901
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
english translator in the sal in the

902
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,880
room uh it's the word berkahat

903
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,359
what would that be in english

904
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,200
yeah no it's not that

905
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,570
um

906
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,520
[Music]

907
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,839
the amount of time people

908
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,280
put into helping every other citizen

909
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,079
having problem with everything we did

910
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,079
i wouldn't expect that

911
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,079
so the amount of time

912
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,079
spent at helping people who were not

913
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,760
able to get a qr code

914
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,920
and not wanting them to

915
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
be left behind

916
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,720
um

917
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,920
i was

918
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,440
touched

919
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
that would that you would never see

920
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,599
around places where i grew normally

921
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,119
and um

922
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,800
oh i don't i don't look out of the

923
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,839
windows

924
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,119
after five o'clock that's it right

925
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
yeah um

926
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,440
but for me was

927
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,680
what's called really invalidated is that

928
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
i had always

929
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,800
an image that people were

930
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,599
anti-transparency

931
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,160
and i just noticed that um it wasn't

932
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
really that but that people find it

933
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
scary and just need to be helped a

934
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,359
little bit

935
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,680
and that's one of the things that um you

936
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
can make a change there and that and

937
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,200
that people like me use arch and not

938
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
mint right yeah that was a

939
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
disappointment that was that was a big

940
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,720
disappointment yeah

941
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,839
thank you

942
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,078
um

943
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,079
yes

944
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
thanks

945
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,390
for everything

946
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,599
[Music]

947
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
especially for doing a i guess decent

948
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,280
job even if you didn't get all the

949
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,460
tickets separately i don't know

950
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,079
[Applause]

951
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,079
what is the uh

952
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,040
biggest

953
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,119
failure that you had and how would you

954
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,160
do it differently next time

955
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,839
what's your biggest failure

956
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,760
yeah i i

957
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,560
i know one um at certain point we

958
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,770
started um

959
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,520
[Music]

960
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
getting people who were defrauding the

961
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,200
system

962
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,000
and at a certain point we um

963
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,839
we had one testing company that we

964
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,480
closed down for a day because we thought

965
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
they were committing fraud and they

966
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
weren't that's for me the one mistake

967
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
where i thought that i should have been

968
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,520
sharper on the whole process myself

969
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,000
and be more aggressive in

970
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,520
uh in in how to deal with that we closed

971
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,960
it down and we shouldn't have done that

972
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
that was my biggest that i should have

973
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
been a lot more aggressive in on the

974
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,160
processes

975
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
and of course we changed that but that

976
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,359
was my biggest mistake

977
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,280
for me

978
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,839
it was always

979
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,760
balancing parliamentary language and

980
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
internal language

981
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,480
and i had several locations where i used

982
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
too many parliamentary language

983
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
internally

984
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
and numerous where i used

985
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
non-parliamentary languages where i

986
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,320
should have

987
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
um

988
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,200
i won't go into details about that

989
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,720
so does everyone have to be bilingual in

990
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,800
government and informatics

991
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
yeah it's translating every day every

992
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,880
minute yeah i used to i've studied

993
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,440
computer science and i always in my mind

994
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,520
it buckles one when one two languages

995
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
are not

996
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,319
easily translatable and those two are

997
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,319
not

998
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,000
so hey thanks for the talk

999
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,640
so in your view what needs to change at

1000
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
other ministries for them to adopt this

1001
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
mentality

1002
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,550
and how will you do that

1003
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,770
[Laughter]

1004
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,240
oh wow um

1005
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
for one

1006
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,440
um

1007
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,839
mendel said um his first question was

1008
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,280
how many

1009
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,040
was it about having how are the

1010
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
differences between how i interacted

1011
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
with him now

1012
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,839
um

1013
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,279
they never heard of club mata

1014
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,079
so they hadn't had the right rings

1015
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,000
um

1016
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
one of my

1017
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,520
co-workers bought a crate of club marty

1018
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
to have the right discussions with

1019
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,240
mendel

1020
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,040
um it's a culture clash and i don't know

1021
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,440
yet how to combine the two

1022
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
we sure have to

1023
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,799
we need more hackers yeah

1024
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,200
hey um

1025
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,880
the dutch government does a lot of work

1026
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,599
with big consultancy firms and they

1027
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,920
spend a lot of taxpayers money on it and

1028
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,640
as a dutch taxpayer

1029
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,240
i would like to understand are there any

1030
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
learnings from this process that you're

1031
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,119
going to take into

1032
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
when the next request for proposal is

1033
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
being sent out

1034
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,800
for a company to bid to

1035
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
yes the parliament asked asked for those

1036
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,240
learnings

1037
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,839
and the um

1038
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,760
for the for the dutch speaking people

1039
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,839
amongst you the bit bit

1040
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,720
or the uh at fiscal years

1041
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,480
the council for ict i'm tested

1042
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,079
and the cio of uh the dutch government

1043
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,920
will implement those and they're amongst

1044
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,359
them

1045
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,839
about how to

1046
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,880
hire the right people for example

1047
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
yeah

1048
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,280
thank you

1049
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,160
hello and thank you please please stand

1050
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,240
close to the microphone and you can pull

1051
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,319
it down

1052
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,040
um

1053
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
somewhere in the beginning you mentioned

1054
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,839
that you enforce and or prove that the

1055
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,920
code is actually

1056
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
the same on the app as in a repo how

1057
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,680
does it work

1058
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
you know that's a very good question i'm

1059
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,640
just looking if the death venom where

1060
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,440
are you because um you invented this and

1061
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,040
also i'm just taking your credits big

1062
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,910
willem

1063
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:51,319
[Applause]

1064
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,720
well he invented it so uh

1065
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,979
[Music]

1066
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,440
all right so so basically i think the

1067
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
the real proper answer i think is

1068
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,720
probably best to go tomorrow or i think

1069
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,119
it's today the to the air mark talk uh

1070
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,400
because basically they'll explain a lot

1071
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,839
more about the

1072
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,440
technology and the cryptography behind

1073
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,119
it which is basically something called

1074
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,760
edemix uh which is exactly sort of like

1075
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,839
something called a zero knowledge proof

1076
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,200
where you uh sort of like prove to the

1077
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
other side that there are certain

1078
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
properties uh that are true at the time

1079
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,480
of you showing it and that property can

1080
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,440
be like i'm vaccinated or i'm okay to

1081
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,480
enter here or my first initial is a d my

1082
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,720
month

1083
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
it was about it was about the notary

1084
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,800
explanation of having

1085
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,880
okay oh sorry sorry about that all right

1086
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,280
i missed that all right so one of the

1087
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,119
the big issues we have is that at some

1088
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,119
point you've got a chunk of source code

1089
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,680
uh it's in github it's stacked um and

1090
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,280
you basically build

1091
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,640
yeah something which goes on to the app

1092
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,920
store and you ultimately sort of like

1093
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
then fetched it from the app store

1094
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,280
and what you really want to know of

1095
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,599
course is that as a citizen that piece

1096
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,680
of code which ends up sort of like at in

1097
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,119
the app store is really the piece of

1098
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,400
code you're actually uh um

1099
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,240
basically just sort of like you've seen

1100
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,319
going there in public

1101
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,839
and the reason you want that is for many

1102
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,119
many reasons because basically there may

1103
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,640
be all sorts of threat actors and

1104
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,319
parties which all that can change that

1105
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,680
including of course people in the

1106
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,640
government themselves even the

1107
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,839
government themselves could sort of like

1108
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,240
be untrusted and be unfair

1109
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,839
so basically what we did there is we did

1110
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,480
two things firstly we

1111
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,319
basically used an escrow service to

1112
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,040
absolutely document exactly which source

1113
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,640
basically what the source code was which

1114
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,800
was going into the build so you really

1115
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,240
sort of like know this is sort of like

1116
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
whatever went into this build process um

1117
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
is basically corresponds to this gib tag

1118
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,720
and these are the the hashes and

1119
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,079
everything else so basically at that

1120
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,160
point you can reproduce it

1121
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,599
and the second thing we did is that we

1122
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,480
had this observed by a notary so someone

1123
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
entirely independent outside the

1124
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,079
government uh which would basically

1125
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,440
observe this process and sort of like

1126
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,599
see through it that this entire process

1127
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,599
onto the app store basically was uh yeah

1128
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,599
and essentially sort of like handled as

1129
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,319
agreed and so on and then after each of

1130
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,240
those releases we publish those

1131
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,440
statements basically sort of like a

1132
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,200
record by the notary as well as the

1133
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,440
escrow statement about what that was

1134
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,359
in github so basically anyone can can

1135
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,800
verify that

1136
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,240
as a hacker i have to say it's a little

1137
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,319
bit sad we didn't get the level of doing

1138
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,079
proper reproducible builds because that

1139
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,920
would be sort of like the next level up

1140
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,520
but that was simply not possible with

1141
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,640
technology

1142
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,160
available and there was this one person

1143
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
who said like i don't trust notaries i

1144
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,800
want to decompile the app and check it

1145
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,319
myself and

1146
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,280
i invited him to do so but unfortunately

1147
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,680
he never came around and i wrote another

1148
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
email like what can we do to facilitate

1149
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,680
this

1150
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,280
it's like do that internally and if you

1151
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,720
look at some of the earlier pen tests

1152
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,319
you'll actually see that the spent has

1153
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,920
started at the sort of like the

1154
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,480
submission to the um uh to the app store

1155
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,839
and sort of like worked back to actually

1156
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,480
confirmed that wasn't thanks

1157
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,599
the main goal here was trust

1158
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,760
hi uh thank you and your team for your

1159
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
work and the talk thank you also for

1160
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,000
these example questions and now since

1161
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,839
there seems to be time anyway why did

1162
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,520
you use comic sans in one slide

1163
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
that's it's a very interesting one yeah

1164
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,839
yeah because i wanted to take the basics

1165
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,839
just because we could yeah

1166
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,680
any last question

1167
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,520
it's going to be a dangerous one

1168
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,880
no no

1169
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,000
i uh my name is niels from zad

1170
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,480
why did you develop opencat and what is

1171
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,319
it

1172
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,280
come to my talk tomorrow at 8pm thank

1173
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,040
you no no i love this

1174
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,560
i i think you have a more extensive

1175
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,200
answer to that

1176
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
no it does now it does

1177
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,920
i have a teaser

1178
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,200
um

1179
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,000
we have extensive testing to do

1180
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,480
ourselves with numerous testing

1181
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,960
providers for example that provided

1182
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
um corona tests and we had to make sure

1183
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,599
that all the that the network was secure

1184
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,640
so what we did was build a open source

1185
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,119
tool and we just open source that

1186
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,520
on the ministries github

1187
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,359
to do that and that's cat

1188
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,520
and it's opencat and for people

1189
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,440
enjoying

1190
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,559
anion's graphics is free cut.now

1191
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,920
but tomorrow there's a talk about that

1192
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,400
cats

1193
