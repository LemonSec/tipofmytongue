00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,359
hello everyone thank you all for being

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,600
here so i'm already a bit older than

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
most of you so that means i grew up

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
in a world where i was the only kid in

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
my town who liked computers and star

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
trek and like

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,800
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
weird and being here with all of

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
you is just like having friends

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
so i really appreciate

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
all of you for being here

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
um so my name is jos i got i'm a

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
software engineer at a some scale up in

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
silicon valley and i have a law degree

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and so this is me and my lawyers robes

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
and i'm going to talk about predictive

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,640
policing

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
specifically predictive policing in the

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
netherlands and so we're going to talk

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
about

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,879
what is predictive policing how do these

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
systems work i have some examples of

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,800
predictive policing systems that are

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
deployed in the netherlands or were

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
deployed in the netherlands

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
specifically i'm going to talk about the

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
legal status of suspicions generated by

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
a computer and the question there is

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
if a police officer walks up to you and

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,360
goes like i have this print out here

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
and it says that you're probably up to

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
something no good can they arrest you

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
for that and so this has never been

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
tested in court but i'm gonna predict

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
this for you and so in a few years you

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,560
will see that i'm right

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
that bit includes audience participation

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,400
now in order to participate in the

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
audience participation you need to be

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
able to raise your right hand so all of

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
you please raise your right hand now

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
okay most of you are able to do the

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720
audience participation bit thank you

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
very much

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
so introducing predictive policing what

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
is predictive policing predictive

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
policing is

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
generating predictions about crime with

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,720
a computer

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,079
but that's it basically this can be

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
crime

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
committed by persons or crime that will

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
victimize particular persons or it can

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,079
be places where particular crimes are

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
going to happen

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
this is a

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,318
the

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
the term predictive policing was coined

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
by bill bratton who is an outstanding

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
police officer who was the chief of

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
the boston police force the la police

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
force and the new york police force so

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,440
this is a guy who knows something about

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
policing

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
the term was

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
uh

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
used it doesn't really apply to a

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
particular algorithm so i am not going

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,360
to bore you with the question

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
is this artificial intelligence is this

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
big data is this machine learning is

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
this risk profiling i don't particularly

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
care if it's a system that uses data in

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
a computer to generate a prediction i

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
call it predictive policing

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
because most of these terms mean

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
different things to different people

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
they're not very interesting

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
what is big data for a police officer

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
might fit on like

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
sort of the spares

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,879
basis between the memory buffers of my

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
screen somewhere

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
artificial intelligence seems to be a

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
term that is only used for things that

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
only humans could do until recently

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
but now a computer can do it as a time

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
when playing a game of chess was

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
artificial intelligence and now this is

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
no longer true so this this is not

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,760
particularly

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
interesting i'm going really fast are

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
you still with me

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
awesome thank you

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,000
so

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
we have been predicting crime since the

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
dawn of time

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
because you know the dawn of time there

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,159
was crime and some people have been

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
trying to predict that and even before

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
we had computers

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
we had people that were trying to

104
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,239
predict crime and they're called crime

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,440
analysts

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
and every police force has crime

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
analysts and these crime analysts they

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,280
use

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
crystal balls

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
calculators

111
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
an abacus this is this room is called

112
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
abacus that's why i had to say abacus

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
to generate predictions about crime so

114
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
i've been doing this like since the cows

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,000
came home

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
but then happened then computers came

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
and uh so computers came and people

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,360
thought what are going to do with that

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
the answer is play pong

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
but then bill bratton

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,358
ran a program called compstat who here

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
has heard about comp stats a few people

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
anyone here did you see the wire

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
yeah okay the wire comes okay

125
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,880
was a program in the u.s police force

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
where they looked at data and tried to

127
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
steer the use of police resources people

128
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
cars horses dogs

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
pepper spray

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
to optimize

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
uh clearance rates

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,479
and clearance rates is like just crimes

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
being solved and so these people had

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
like weekly meetings and they were like

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
hit over the head with a police baton if

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
the clearance weights went down

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
i said oh my god the clearance

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
rates need to go up how do i make the

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
clearance rates go up answer is easy

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
stop recording crimes

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
because if you stop recording crimes you

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
have fewer crimes and then or you only

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
record the crimes when you have solved

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,919
them

145
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,280
because then the clearings rate

146
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,639
clearance rate and the crime rate go

147
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,759
hand in hand i can really recommend that

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
practice if clearance rates is the only

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,639
thing that you

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,080
are interested in

151
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
bill bradton thought like we have

152
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
computers we can use these same stats

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,639
and excel

154
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
and generate predictions

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
about crime and this is what happens

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
basically i'll get to that later how

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
that worked

158
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
but modern technology added and i'm not

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
going to talk about machine learning a

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
lot because all of you know how machine

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
learning works and all of you know how

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,759
tensorflow works and all of you can at

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,479
least do sort of logistic regression on

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,039
your hp calculators

165
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,199
added the fact that quantity has its own

166
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
quality so if you have lots of data

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
and you have lots of processing powers

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,759
you can go to a level of

169
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
finding patterns in that data that are

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,039
impossible to do if you're just a human

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
humans are not

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
very good at finding accurate patterns

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
in large unstructured sets of data

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,240
and so i got this quote here that says

175
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
humans can sometimes find a needle in a

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
haystack

177
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
modern technology can search all the

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,759
haystacks figure out what's normal in a

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
haystack find all the things that

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
deviate from that norm which might be

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,039
needles

182
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,440
any guess who said that

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
yeah i said that so thank you very much

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
it was in my master thesis on this very

185
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,199
topic and because my master thesis was

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
evaluated by law professors

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
and law professors and computers

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,880
don't mix very well

189
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
this has become so standard that you can

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
buy this book

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,000
which is called data mining and

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
predictive analysis and if you want to

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
have like a little shrill moment we got

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
this is scary you need to go to amazon

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
then you have that schwill moment but

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
then you need to continue and read the

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
description of this book

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
and then you get your second shrill

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,919
moment because

200
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
this book describes how you can use

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
off-the-shelf tools

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,599
like excel

203
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,840
to find to predict crime

204
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
so the author basically says

205
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
here's a ton of math

206
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,560
here's a bunch of excel macros

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
export the csv file from your local

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
crime reporting system if you're down in

209
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,080
hackensack police department and you can

210
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
use this and now you can predict some

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,360
crime and police officers do this

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
this is extremely scary because these

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,000
people don't necessarily know what

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,199
they're doing

215
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
when using computers or

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
not using computers

217
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
um

218
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
okay are you still with me

219
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
okay stay with me 10 minutes in this is

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
going well so

221
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
how do these predictive police systems

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
work they work like this this is a

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
diagram that i copied from my research

224
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
report on the topic and it basically

225
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,199
says

226
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
you have some data

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,919
you run some math

228
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,000
now you have a prediction and you give

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
that prediction to a police officer and

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,039
you go like here's a prediction about

231
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
some crime

232
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
go do something with that

233
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
and then they find crime and they have

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,639
new data and they run the next

235
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
generation of the model and then they

236
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
have some new report

237
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
and this is literally how this goes so

238
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
that you can see the feedback loop here

239
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
where actual data turns into historical

240
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
data

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
and turns into the next generation of

242
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,360
the model and this is one of the

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
problems with

244
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,479
predictive policing and i'll get to that

245
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
later but i'll announce this now quickly

246
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
all of us

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
as we are sitting here

248
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,279
are

249
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,519
committing some crimes

250
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
and the reason for that is that the the

251
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
stack of law books is about this high

252
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
and there is no way that any of us are

253
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,519
in complete compliance with everything

254
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,040
that's in there

255
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
the only reason that you're not arrested

256
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
right now

257
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
is that you have not annoyed enough of

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
the right people

259
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
to be arrested and there's just not

260
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
enough please around here in uniform

261
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
this is a tip for people if you want to

262
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,560
discover undercover police officers in

263
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
the netherlands look at their shoes

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,839
because they're all wearing black

265
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,200
mephistos

266
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
with shoelaces

267
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
so if you see any of these people

268
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
they're undercover police officers so

269
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
you haven't

270
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
annoyed enough of the right people yet

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
that is why you're not getting arrested

272
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,720
because you're all doing something wrong

273
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,680
now

274
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
this means that if you use predictive

275
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
policing to send a bunch of police

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
officers to a place

277
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
they will find crime there

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
because there's crime everywhere and

279
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
then they find that crime that goes back

280
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
into the model and go like oh my god

281
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
this is a place where there's a lot of

282
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,760
crime that sends some more police

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
officers to there so they go back to

284
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,560
that same place and find more crime and

285
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
this is the feedback loop that a lot of

286
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,920
predictive policing

287
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,079
systems are vulnerable to i'm not saying

288
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,440
that this is happening all the time but

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
they're vulnerable to it

290
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
let me see that i've got my speakers and

291
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
i'll say

292
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,360
no i got it

293
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
so let's talk about some

294
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
predictive policing systems

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,959
i name four

296
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
i'll cover three

297
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
very briefly there is information on the

298
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,480
internet

299
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
about what all of these

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
systems do in somewhat more detail

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,320
so here are some predictive police

302
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
systems first of all uh pred paul

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
from the us also applied in the united

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,200
kingdom

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
uh the strategic subjects list which is

306
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,519
one of my favorites but i'm not gonna

307
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
spend a lot of time on it but like if

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
you want to know more about it talk to

309
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
me today or tomorrow because it's

310
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
fascinating um

311
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
the crime anticipation system or as you

312
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,599
say in holland criminality anticipation

313
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
which is also in the netherlands

314
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
any of you have a favorite system that's

315
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
not on the list

316
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
no okay sorry

317
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
free crime

318
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
a pre-crime oh yeah a minority report

319
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
yeah i was i was like this close to call

320
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,079
my

321
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,120
master thesis minori report on the a

322
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
because the a is the river that goes

323
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
through amsterdam

324
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
but i couldn't get the introduction

325
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
running

326
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
it's kind of weird and uh so if you you

327
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,079
have seen the movie minority report

328
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,120
some who has read the short story

329
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
okay it's fewer people okay all of you

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
have seen the movie go read the short

331
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,640
story like any of standing of uh like

332
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
any of his work what's the author again

333
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,079
uh sorry

334
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,000
oh yeah philip k dick like any of thank

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,680
you very much any of philip k dick's

336
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,560
work

337
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
the stories are

338
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
infinitely better than the movie and all

339
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,600
of philip k dick's work

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
you have to answer the following three

341
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,079
questions

342
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,600
or no actually no you have to answer one

343
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
question the question is who here is on

344
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
lsd

345
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
is it the reader

346
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
the protagonist of the story

347
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
or the author

348
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,639
potentially more than one

349
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
that it's and so minority reports

350
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
stunning it's it's a decent movie if you

351
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,800
like tom cruise it's a stunning short

352
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
story and it's about predictive pleasing

353
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
using mutants the police in holland does

354
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
not have

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,920
telepathic

356
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,200
for the

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
mutants with foresight but they have

358
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
computers

359
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
however

360
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,839
before we get there are you still with

361
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,959
me

362
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
yes okay are we enjoying this

363
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
thank you

364
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,560
um

365
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
first first software pred poll

366
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,320
or as they name it now geolithica

367
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
so this was based on the insight that i

368
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
mentioned before which is that the data

369
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
that you get for compstat

370
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
can be used to make crime predictions

371
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
and so they put some scientists on it

372
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
live wet white lab coats from ucla and

373
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
santa clara

374
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
and they developed an algorithm and that

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
algorithm is called etas

376
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,240
and that is patented in uh

377
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
patent law you can read it it's like any

378
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
patent it's a completely useless it

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,639
doesn't say anything about anything

380
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
and there's a

381
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
commercial implementation by predble inc

382
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
which is now renamed and they sell this

383
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
through the united states

384
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,320
and because it is a company it is secret

385
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
how it works

386
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
we don't really personally

387
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
i think that's a problem

388
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
but i'm

389
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,199
sorry

390
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
i work and live in the united states um

391
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,720
and i'm the i'm the odd one out there

392
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
so we're in holland for those of you who

393
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
follow dutch politics i'm like on the

394
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
right side of t66

395
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,839
which makes me sort of like a suspicious

396
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,160
right-wing character here in holland in

397
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
america i'm like a communist

398
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
people come to me and go like josh you

399
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
don't understand bernie is a socialist

400
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
like no no no bernie is a millionaire

401
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
socialism is the common ownership of the

402
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
means of production

403
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
and then i've lost them

404
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,839
exciting um

405
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,399
anyway so i think that is problematic

406
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
but as we will see

407
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
other

408
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
systems aren't much better

409
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,199
so

410
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,519
what are the foundations of the etes

411
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,040
algorithm the foundation of the eta's

412
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
algorithms are three

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
one of them is called repeat

414
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
victimization which basically means if

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
you are a victim of a certain type of

416
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,079
crime

417
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
you are more likely

418
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
than most to become a victim of exactly

419
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
that same type of crime again

420
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,680
secondly

421
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,399
near repeat victimization

422
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
people that are near you if your house

423
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
gets burgled

424
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
the houses around you have a higher

425
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
probability of being burgled

426
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,760
within a short amount of time

427
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,800
because burglars work street by street

428
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
measure street by street or they take

429
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
the same bus into the suburbs

430
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,639
rob a bunch of houses the next day they

431
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,720
take the same bus into the suburbs that

432
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
break into a bunch of houses this is one

433
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,079
of the reasons why we don't have public

434
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
transport in the united states because

435
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
peop i am not kidding you people

436
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,600
do not want subway lines or buses into

437
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
their neighborhoods because that will

438
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,279
bring criminals

439
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,160
from

440
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
in case of boston downtown crossing

441
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,800
which is like right downtown where like

442
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,320
three major subway lines meet

443
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,680
and local search

444
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
and local search is the most

445
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,199
amazing

446
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
insight of this is that

447
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
criminals are very likely or are more

448
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,040
likely than average to commit crimes

449
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,199
near what we call the anchors of their

450
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
existence so their home their work and

451
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
on the route between them

452
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
personally i think if i would be a

453
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,399
burglar i would not burgle the homes

454
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,000
where i live

455
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,519
because that makes it much more likely

456
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
that i get recognized but apparently

457
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
burgers do this now

458
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
this is not

459
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,199
crazy there is actual science that

460
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,759
sort of bears these statements out so

461
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
there's criminologists are there any

462
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,399
criminologists in the audience

463
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
no no so criminologists they studies a

464
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
crime as a social science

465
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
they've been writing papers about this

466
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
for a long time so this basically this

467
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
bears out this is

468
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,759
true for the to the extent that you can

469
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,800
say that

470
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,959
things are actually true

471
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,519
so they developed the etas algorithm

472
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
epidemic type aftershock sequence and

473
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
the principle is okay there's like a

474
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
chance of crime

475
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,639
and because of these three patterns

476
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
they're sort of an aftershock like an

477
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
earthquake

478
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
and that aftershock dampens over time

479
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
and then they have this formula that

480
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
comes from the predapole website they

481
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
don't say what any of these variable

482
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,279
means

483
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,880
so it's called it's called proof by

484
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
intimidation

485
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
oh my god they've got math this

486
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,359
must be good like so

487
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,400
um

488
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
and this is what they do

489
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,559
so

490
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,160
what i would love to discuss but i have

491
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
no time for

492
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
the field experiments they did that show

493
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
that has all sorts of like problematic

494
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
uh reasons and pred paul's amazing

495
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,199
statement that their system is free of

496
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
prejudice

497
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,120
okay

498
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
there was pret ball system number two

499
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
sensing

500
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
sensing was a project by the dutch

501
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,799
police officer month which is that in

502
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
the south of the netherlands

503
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
uh roumant has a big shopping mall and

504
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,799
they had figured out that

505
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
criminals come there

506
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
to pickpocket and rob and break into

507
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,840
cars it's called mobile banditism mobile

508
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,200
bonditism

509
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
and you're like we're going to do

510
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,799
we're going to develop a predictive

511
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
policing system that will just tell us

512
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
who these people are

513
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,400
and then we're going to deal with them

514
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
before they get to the mall

515
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,039
this system which has many problematic

516
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,240
aspects was paused in 2020 because what

517
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
happened in 2020 there was a sharp

518
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,760
decline of people coming to the mall

519
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
one of the great

520
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
advantages of the pandemic

521
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
that this system was killed so how did

522
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,120
census work we don't know it is secret

523
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,919
there was a freedom of information act

524
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,039
uh request for dutch the way obey or as

525
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,120
you call it now the veo the vet open

526
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
overhead

527
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
and they figured out that it's probably

528
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
related to the following things

529
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
there's a group of men

530
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
in a car with a german or romanian

531
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
license plates

532
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
rental car three to five years old or a

533
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
car that's stolen

534
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
that's probably hugely important and

535
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
then it goes into the secret these and

536
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,840
other factors go into the secret

537
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
algorithm

538
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,919
projects a risk score if that score

539
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,480
exceeds a threshold it goes to some

540
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
police officers

541
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,840
on the street or like on the freeway in

542
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
this case

543
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
and they go and stop that car

544
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,000
now the question is based on what

545
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
legal

546
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
theory

547
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
and i'm going to explain to that so that

548
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
stay tuned but that's what they do

549
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,039
the freedom of information act gave us

550
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,640
the following information

551
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,600
you see

552
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
you see there's a little n here that was

553
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
not secret

554
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
so the letter n

555
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,919
has got something to do with this

556
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,039
uh

557
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
i mean some of the that they

558
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
blocked out is amazing this says the

559
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,679
administration of the reference lists

560
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
is taking place

561
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
at

562
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
locked out some office

563
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
secret office

564
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,480
or

565
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,280
the responsible department for the

566
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
downloading and updating of the

567
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
reference file

568
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
we can't notice

569
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
the fabric of society would unravel when

570
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,080
we know this

571
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,039
third one up the crime anticipation

572
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,760
system that criminality's

573
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
developed by the police unit of

574
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
amsterdam currently being rolled out and

575
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,880
implemented in the entire country

576
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
the goal was to create enriched

577
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
forecasts of crime and turning these

578
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,480
into tangible instructions and then

579
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
ensure that beet plot beat police

580
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
officers act according to these

581
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
instructions this came right out of the

582
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
dilbert missing statement

583
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
generator there's an amazing video on

584
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
youtube uh crime costs for kids and

585
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
explains sort of like in two kids like

586
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
you know this is your computer and

587
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
it's amazing video

588
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
um

589
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,679
how does it work

590
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
pretty much the same as etas

591
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,919
so it has a

592
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
focus on burglary and street robberies

593
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,520
it

594
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,679
takes data from all sorts of sources it

595
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,280
generates heat maps

596
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
on where the crime is going to happen in

597
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
squares of 125 125 meters and then the

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,159
three percent of squares with the

599
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,840
highest risk scores are called yellow

600
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,280
orange and red

601
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
and then you get something like this

602
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,440
this is amsterdam

603
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,720
apparently

604
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
a lot of crime in the east of amsterdam

605
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
without the computer we would have never

606
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
guessed this

607
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,799
completely novel insight strangely

608
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
enough

609
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,919
not on the map but there's something

610
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,360
here in the south of amsterdam called

611
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
the southern axis where all the big law

612
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
firms are

613
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
not colored red but i'm pretty certain

614
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,840
that there's a ton of crime

615
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,559
happening right there

616
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,840
but that is not a crime that they're

617
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,039
interested in

618
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,919
these systems exist

619
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
i will

620
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,039
keep my social commentary to myself

621
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,000
um

622
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,679
some issues around predictive policing

623
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,400
now

624
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
this is a very suave audience that knows

625
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
about computers so i'm going to like run

626
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
through them

627
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
because it's completely obvious

628
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
first of all input data quality crime

629
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
reporting

630
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
is incredibly hard

631
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,080
and criminal data about which crimes

632
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,679
happened and where they happened is

633
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
completely unevenly distributed based on

634
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
social economic factors type of crime

635
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
who is liable to report this crime like

636
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,559
there's a hope it's it's a morass so

637
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
a big thing in criminology which is the

638
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
study of crime as a social science

639
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
is guessing the dark number the

640
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,200
unreported crime

641
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
i've never heard any discussion about

642
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
this in any of my

643
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
predictive policing research that i've

644
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
done please seems to be unaware of this

645
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
secondly

646
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,840
this is the only thing i'm going to say

647
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,200
about that

648
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
but apparently

649
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,799
there is some racial prejudice in

650
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,360
society and apparently computers

651
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,280
leverage and amplify

652
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
that racial prejudice

653
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
the police seem to be completely unaware

654
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
of this never read anything about any of

655
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
this in any of the research

656
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
that i've done including reports by the

657
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
police itself

658
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,440
personally

659
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
i think this is a problem

660
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
but again

661
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
what am i i'm white in america and so

662
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,720
who am i going to complain to

663
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
so the social justice impact is amazing

664
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
these systems get used

665
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
to predict low level street crime bernie

666
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,440
madoff was not caught by a predictive

667
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
policing system

668
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
like uh no for it's always

669
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,200
pickpocketing

670
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,679
street like burglaries

671
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,440
robberies etc

672
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
and i already mentioned the feedback

673
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,679
loop

674
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
most importantly does it work and the

675
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,880
answer is we don't know

676
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
whether it works

677
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
what i do know is that a few

678
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
teams in america discontinued to use of

679
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
bret ball because either it was too

680
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
expensive

681
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,159
or they just couldn't figure out what to

682
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
do with the predictions

683
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
so he said does it work yes the

684
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,159
predictive aspects some of somewhat work

685
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,520
but i think

686
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
that they're also obvious

687
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,600
right

688
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
does it lead to more solved crimes

689
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
i have not seen any definitive data

690
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,039
about that there are some

691
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
reports that say that it works but

692
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,720
they're mostly done by people that are

693
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,880
sort of not unbiased with respect to the

694
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
police predictive policing system that

695
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
they're using

696
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
does it then at least lead to the same

697
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
clearance crimes with fewer cops even

698
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
that i don't know personally i don't

699
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,679
think it works

700
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,840
right but

701
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,159
okay so that's that now we get to the

702
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,880
legal aspects of predictive policing

703
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
and let me take a short break here to

704
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
ask you are you still with me

705
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,880
okay cool

706
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,120
hang on

707
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,600
i love giving talks to a

708
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,000
hyper-intelligent audience

709
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,159
the hardest course i have ever taught

710
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
was java for non-programmers

711
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
it's a bit of a hard course because

712
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
someone asked me

713
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,159
when i had to explain the if statement

714
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,919
but why do you need an if statement

715
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,360
so i thought about it for a while and i

716
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
told her like well

717
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
imagine a world with an if statement

718
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
and imagine a world without an if

719
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
statement

720
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,159
that in itself is an if statement

721
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
i had a lot of fun there yeah no it was

722
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
people were super nice

723
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,480
um okay legal aspects now this is uh

724
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
maester josh fisher talking your

725
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
friendly neighborhood lawyer

726
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,240
in the netherlands

727
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,640
you can only the police can only use

728
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,919
certain invasive investigative measures

729
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
when there's a reasonable reasonable

730
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
suspicion of guilt based on facts and

731
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
circumstances

732
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,159
that a crime was committed

733
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,720
and that the target of the the suspect

734
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
is guilty of it

735
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
for the dutch people among us articles

736
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,720
even in vintage traffording

737
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
now

738
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
in america we have the fourth amendment

739
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,400
which is reasonable uh

740
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
stop and search search and seizure

741
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
volumes bookshelves libraries full of

742
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,919
legal analysis about the fourth

743
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,039
amendment

744
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
in holland the entire

745
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,600
sort of like jurisprudence and legal

746
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,679
analysis on article 27 is about

747
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,120
this thick

748
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
12-pitch single-sided

749
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,640
u.s letter

750
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
i know because i printed it out

751
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,760
and i'll explain to you why

752
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
so you have to have reasonable guilt

753
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
of suspicion crime etc

754
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,320
now we have to so all of you everything

755
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
you've ever seen on television about

756
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,559
this is false

757
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,480
even if you've watched the us television

758
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,919
show and you think you know something

759
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,159
about the fourth amendment it is also

760
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,440
false

761
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
tv my friends

762
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
is not

763
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,760
a documentary on the us legal system

764
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
but the possible exception of we own

765
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,400
this city by on hbo max which is totally

766
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,720
amazing

767
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,399
so even in the u.s the fourth amendment

768
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,000
doesn't work the way uh you think it

769
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,039
might work

770
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,039
read these two statements

771
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,720
or review these these two court cases

772
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
because the the u.s supreme court has

773
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
been executing a low-level war on the

774
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,200
fourth amendment since 1984.

775
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,799
ask me about

776
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,360
this after the fact i got amazing um

777
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
case law um about this so forget

778
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,960
everything you've learned on tv so now

779
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,039
it is time for audience participation by

780
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,360
a raise of hands so this is the case

781
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
the police officer gets a

782
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
call from the office that has a burglary

783
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,960
and a school

784
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
and then he walks around and he sees

785
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
someone he knows professionally

786
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
walking from the direction of the school

787
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
wearing black gloves

788
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,600
it goes like that that's not kosher

789
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,840
stops this person and arrests them

790
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,679
uh on suspicion of having committed that

791
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,799
burglary

792
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,120
was this reasonable if you think

793
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,880
this is reasonable suspicion of guilt

794
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
raise your hand

795
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
okay none of you should ever talk to a

796
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,480
police officer ever this is reasonable

797
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,559
suspicion of guilt

798
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,039
in the netherlands famous case exactly

799
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,840
this case look for zwarte

800
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,399
in bragg and you'll get the case

801
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,480
this is reasonable suspicion of guilt

802
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
next one

803
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,750
sorry

804
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,200
[Music]

805
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
no if you just look for zwarte hanshun

806
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
in bragg's hall

807
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,919
then then you can find it but it's it's

808
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,000
exact it's exactly what happened if you

809
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
read this you got the summary of the

810
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,559
case

811
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,919
apart from the fact that the judge says

812
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,480
like no this is totally reasonable

813
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
um

814
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,120
i i

815
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,360
i'm not sure what i think of this i must

816
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,480
honestly say

817
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,039
that's not true

818
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,320
we don't who knows if we don't care

819
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
oh sorry thank you for pointing that out

820
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,159
you're absolutely right the question

821
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
from the audience was was this person

822
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,720
convicted i don't know and i don't care

823
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,399
because

824
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,799
come again

825
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,279
no

826
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
the question is is it stan the hodor or

827
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,440
arstia

828
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,039
[Applause]

829
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
i mean dutch man it's not a language

830
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,159
it's more like a heap of words that

831
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,640
starts with

832
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
my wife is american after like many

833
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,360
years of marriage i gathered to say from

834
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,279
heart failures to my birthday i think

835
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,760
this is it

836
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,159
lisa honey if you watch this on the

837
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,120
stream or on video i love you

838
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,159

839
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
uh

840
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,840
and people who know me better go like

841
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,240
dude that's what you need really um so

842
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,640
the question was was it legal to just

843
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,679
stop him

844
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
or arrest them and i can't quite

845
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,799
remember and it doesn't matter

846
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,240
i need to go on oh

847
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
second case

848
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,640
two police officers see a black man

849
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
running away from a cafe that they know

850
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,279
is a place where drugs are being sold

851
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
they think this is suspicious black men

852
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
running away

853
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,720
from a known drugs

854
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,760
then

855
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,240
they stop him they find some heroin

856
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
even in the netherlands when this was

857
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,799
case happened in the 70s

858
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,200
they thought this was not cool

859
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
so they arrested him

860
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,039
regarding the stop of search

861
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
is his reasonable suspicion of guilt or

862
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,760
not

863
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
who thinks this is reasonable suspicion

864
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
of guilt

865
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
no

866
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,200
you're wrong the court said it was not

867
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,919
reasonable suspicion of guilt

868
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,320
black men running in the netherlands

869
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,039
completely legal

870
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,559
i mean

871
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,760
we are we're

872
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
worldwide known for our tolerance and

873
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,480
this shows it

874
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
actually people think the holland is

875
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
tolerant we're not we don't generally

876
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,919
give a

877
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,640
it's not tolerance it's just like i

878
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
i don't care

879
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,519
okay

880
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,840
audience participation number three

881
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
police officers again

882
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
see a white man

883
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,519
talking to a few black men

884
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,120
sometime later they see the group

885
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
driving around in a car with a german

886
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,360
license plates

887
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,360
the next thing that happens is they see

888
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,039
that car parked in the street they go

889
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,519
like this is bad like white black men in

890
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,760
the same car german license plate

891
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,600
this is crazy so they they cross

892
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,240
the road to go to that car

893
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,840
and the black men run away and we know

894
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,559
that that's legal

895
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
black men can run away

896
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,320
uh but he goes like that this is crazy

897
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
they they search the white men find

898
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
drugs

899
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,559
regarding the stop and search of the

900
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,480
white men is a reasonable suspicion of

901
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,320
guilt or not who thinks it's reasonable

902
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,799
suspicion of guilt

903
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,559
no okay so the people raised the hand

904
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,240
are right this is reasonable suspicion

905
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,519
of guilt

906
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
and now so this case is called dumrak

907
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,519
which is a street in amsterdam it's

908
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,360
where it happened and the last case is

909
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,559
called

910
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,919
it used to be called differently but i

911
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,840
now like to refer it as to the running

912
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
colored gentleman

913
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,880
um but that is not the the traditional

914
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,480
name of the case don't ask me what it

915
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
was

916
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
and that um can't see where i was the uh

917
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,399
sorry

918
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
your words not mine

919
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
so it's a go talk to this about your

920
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,919
name lady

921
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,440
what's your name

922
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
okay go talk to inge

923
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,039
and she has

924
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,240
she can say whatever she wants because

925
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,159
free country man yeah so you can ask

926
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,919
what is the difference between this case

927
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
and the last case

928
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,519
we don't quite know

929
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
but what happened in this particular

930
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
case and it's very important

931
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
is that the police officer who did the

932
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
stop and search said like well

933
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
in my vast experience as a police

934
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,840
officer in amsterdam

935
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
if i see foreign white men talking to

936
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,200
black men that's a drug steal

937
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,399
and the judge goes like that's

938
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,799
completely reasonable

939
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,399
and so this is reasonable suspicion of

940
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,760
guilt

941
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,080
audience participation number four and

942
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
the last one i promise two police

943
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,360
officers see a person they know

944
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,799
professionally walk around with a

945
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,440
plastic bag

946
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,960
so they talk to the person and go like

947
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
hey what's in the bag and the guy says

948
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
like oh some books i've just stolen

949
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,960
criminals are not necessarily smart

950
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,480
and so they arrest this person on

951
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
suspicion of theft of books

952
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,519
regarding the stop and the ensuing

953
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,039
conversation is that a reasonable

954
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,440
suspicion of guilt or not

955
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,799
just yes no who says yes

956
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,440
okay okay who says no

957
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,239
okay

958
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,879
you're all wrong

959
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,560
and i'll explain to you why you're all

960
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,359
wrong

961
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
the judge didn't get to the question

962
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,560
whether it was and this requires some

963
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
fine legal training

964
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,520
didn't get to the question whether

965
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,960
there's a reasonable suspicion of guilt

966
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
or not

967
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,399
because the police just like any other

968
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,399
citizen can have a conversation with

969
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,760
someone

970
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
and just ask

971
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,399
hey how are you doing

972
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,079
what's in the bag

973
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,560
that is not an execution

974
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,000
of investigative powers by the police

975
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
it doesn't require special permission to

976
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,800
do this anyone can do this

977
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
if you now

978
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,480
confess to

979
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
kevin committed a crime now they have

980
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,040
reasonable suspicion

981
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,320
and they uh they arrest you and so

982
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
there was they didn't need reasonable

983
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
suspicion of guilt to talk to the

984
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
person because anyone can do that and

985
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,480
after their the guy had basically

986
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
confessed that he committed a crime

987
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
now they could arrest him

988
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
and it was completely reasonable

989
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,200
everyone still with me

990
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,640
okay so

991
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,320
this goes to something called the

992
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,240
continued application of powers and this

993
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
is important remember this phrase fourth

994
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,359
question from

995
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,920
i cut this piece from the actual case

996
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,839
put it in google translate and this is

997
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,200
what came out of it

998
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
which is made i've worked for google for

999
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
12 years i think an amazing company

1000
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,960
if for no other reason that i can do

1001
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
this

1002
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,920
what happens so the police has powers

1003
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,119
under different laws some of these are

1004
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,480
criminal laws

1005
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,079
some of them are administrative laws so

1006
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
the police

1007
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,839
as the administrative executors of the

1008
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,359
liquor act

1009
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,359
can come into your cafe and check your

1010
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,280
permit

1011
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
while they are there

1012
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
legally

1013
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,079
as the administrative officers of the

1014
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,480
liquor act they see a gun

1015
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,760
and they're like hey there's a gun this

1016
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,280
is illegal

1017
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,920
now they can continue to use powers that

1018
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
they get from another law

1019
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
criminal law

1020
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,800
because now they have reasonable

1021
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
suspicion

1022
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,680
this is super important this is what

1023
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,040
happened in the last case about the

1024
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,480
books in the plastic bag this has

1025
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
happened in what in the the severe

1026
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,640
arrest the rifle

1027
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,680
case

1028
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,640
and

1029
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
this is what happens in sensing

1030
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
because what happened is remember

1031
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
sensing vermont mobile banditism cars

1032
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,200
what police would do is they would get

1033
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
the risk score

1034
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,920
and then they would go and stop the car

1035
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,599
under their powers

1036
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,920
in the road traffic safety act

1037
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
and according to the road traffic safety

1038
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
act the police can stop any car

1039
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,800
inspect your driver's license and

1040
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,640
registration

1041
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
like and that's and they don't need any

1042
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,079
reasonable suspicion they can just do

1043
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,200
that

1044
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,280
like whatever and then while they do

1045
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
that they're gonna like huh it's kind of

1046
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,560
suspicious

1047
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
these people are smoking dope

1048
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
i don't like this car it's a bit of a

1049
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
mess they don't have a real story about

1050
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,119
where they are where they're going

1051
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,560
i'm gonna

1052
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
frisk arrest search like whatever the

1053
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,800
investigative powers are

1054
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,400
and this is continued application of

1055
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
powers they stopped the car

1056
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,760
under their powers in the road traffic

1057
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
and safety act

1058
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,680
very vet and then they can once they

1059
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,480
then get like a reasonable suspicion

1060
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,440
they

1061
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
continue to use the powers from the

1062
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
criminal law and that is how they sort

1063
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,599
of get around that now

1064
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,119
you would ask yourself i would ask

1065
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,760
myself is this legal and the answer is

1066
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,800
no it's called the tournament

1067
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,440
it's like a re-routing of powers

1068
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,480
you can only use an administrative power

1069
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
for the explicit purpose that it is

1070
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,760
given for

1071
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,520
if you get powers out of the road and

1072
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
safety act

1073
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,800
you can only use this

1074
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
to improve road safety

1075
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
you cannot use this as a cover for

1076
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,599
something else all together which is

1077
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,280
like mobile banditism

1078
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
so it's not allowed does it happen yes

1079
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,880
all the time

1080
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,640
like why is this not stopped it doesn't

1081
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,880
get to court

1082
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,520
these cases the courts it's untested

1083
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,119
and also when in court the police lies

1084
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,480
okay who don't hope to believe that one

1085
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
of my nieces works for the police but

1086
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
please lie they go to court and go like

1087
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,320
no no we we just we really just you know

1088
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,920
car looked a bit flimsy wanted to check

1089
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
the insurance you never know and then

1090
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,040
completely unexpectedly

1091
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,280
10 minutes we found this

1092
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
so they do this

1093
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,320
i

1094
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,880
think this is problematic

1095
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,119
so why does this not get tested in court

1096
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,400
two reasons reason number one

1097
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,079
these cases only come to court for

1098
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,440
guilty people

1099
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
because innocent people

1100
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,040
they get like because they're materially

1101
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,200
innocent they get sent packing and go

1102
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
like happy i'm done with this

1103
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,240
 and they're not gonna go and press

1104
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,079
the legal matter

1105
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,880
guilty people go like i'm guilty as

1106
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,200
but maybe i can get a way out

1107
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
and then the court goes like yeah

1108
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
this is one of these things that guilty

1109
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
people do to escape punishment that's

1110
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,359
really not right and so the the dutch

1111
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,960
version of the district attorney the

1112
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
prosecuting officer and the judges are

1113
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
just not often willing to cut people a

1114
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,640
break

1115
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
this is also related to a fundamental

1116
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
difference in the dutch and american

1117
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,320
system of criminal prudence in the

1118
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
jurisprudence is like the inquisitorial

1119
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
versus the acquisitorial system

1120
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,440
the the goal of the dutch system

1121
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,560
is to

1122
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,960
find the truth and formalism shouldn't

1123
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,200
get in the way of that too much even

1124
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,720
when the police and the district

1125
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
attorney at opened by ministeri are like

1126
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,359
way out of line

1127
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,400
the judge is very very restricted in

1128
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
like putting a stop to this

1129
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,960
so

1130
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,240
that's part one part number two

1131
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,760
your reasonable suspicion of guilt needs

1132
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,400
to be based on facts and circumstances

1133
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
just a feeling is not enough

1134
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,599
however the list of facts and

1135
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,440
circumstances that can lead to a

1136
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,960
reasonable suspicion is very long and

1137
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
very inclusive one of the few times when

1138
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
the dutch place is very inclusive when

1139
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,200
it comes to

1140
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
facts and circumstances

1141
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
this stuff is only tested marginally in

1142
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
courts and by marginal testing i mean

1143
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,119
that the judge asked himself

1144
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,520
is it completely unreasonable that the

1145
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,920
police officer got to this conclusion

1146
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,960
and if the answer is no it's not

1147
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560
completely unreasonable it's reasonable

1148
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
and it's allowed so

1149
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,480
grounds for reasonable suspicion caught

1150
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,960
in the act the normal situation is

1151
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,319
police officer see someone it's not

1152
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,839
normal here

1153
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,680
knowledge and experience i know that if

1154
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,839
white men and black men talk it's about

1155
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,119
drugs

1156
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,720
official notices

1157
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
tips from the team criminal intelligence

1158
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,040
anonymous tips are allowed

1159
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
as grounds for

1160
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,400
reasonable suspicion sometimes the court

1161
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,880
put some fences around that but

1162
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,359
the supreme court said

1163
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,200
the general thought that an anonymous

1164
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,440
tip cannot lead to a reasonable

1165
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,119
suspicion of guilt is not true

1166
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,240
so it's actually easier to say

1167
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,560
what is unreasonable suspicion of guilt

1168
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,000
if it's completely based on the

1169
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,240
intuition if it's entirely based on

1170
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
prejudice

1171
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,000
if the information is clearly unreliable

1172
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
or the argumentation is just completely

1173
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
flimsy then it's

1174
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
unreasonable if it doesn't meet any of

1175
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
these tests reasonable application so a

1176
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,079
reasonable

1177
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,079
suspicion of guilt

1178
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,520
so what does this mean for predictive

1179
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,240
policing said it's untested in court but

1180
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
i am totally pessimistic

1181
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,839
and why am i totally pessimistic i'm

1182
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,000
totally pessimistic because

1183
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,800
information from the predictive police

1184
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,079
system

1185
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,359
is a source that is based on data

1186
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,680
about crimes in the past is not that

1187
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,960
dissimilar

1188
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,800
from the knowledge and experience of

1189
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
police officers it is not that

1190
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,400
dissimilar

1191
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,520
from

1192
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,200
things about the normal situation it is

1193
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,760
not that dissimilar to anonymous tips it

1194
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,599
is not that dissimilar from the work of

1195
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,200
crime analysts

1196
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,520
that put down their work in

1197
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,440
official notices and send it to the

1198
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
police officers and we know from

1199
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,599
existing jurisprudence that all these

1200
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,760
things are

1201
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,359
an important factor in determining

1202
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,760
reasonable suspicion of guilt so i am

1203
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,079
very pessimistic that the court will say

1204
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
like well this is completely

1205
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,280
some computer

1206
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
i understand logistic regression i

1207
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,440
understand bias amplification i

1208
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,760
understand dark numbers i understand i

1209
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,040
think this is unreasonable i don't think

1210
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,480
the court's going to say that i don't

1211
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,920
know but i think the court's not going

1212
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,359
to say that

1213
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,359
i have some hope

1214
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,720
five minutes

1215
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,560
i have some hope

1216
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,240
that the court will

1217
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,119
some court someday in holland

1218
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,280
will go and go like well i need to

1219
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,880
understand how this data gets put

1220
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,760
together

1221
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
and so that goes to explainability of

1222
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,680
machine learning models now this is not

1223
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
a talk about machine learning but like

1224
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,119
there is there is some theoretical

1225
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,440
research in the area of explainability

1226
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
and that goes to questions like how did

1227
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,760
this machine come to the outcome now

1228
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,960
certain types of algorithms and machine

1229
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,760
learning models are explainable you can

1230
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,920
sort of figure out how the input data

1231
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,520
was constructed and the output data

1232
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,440
arrived like decision trees and most of

1233
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,280
the regression models etc

1234
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,040
a whole lot of models these days the

1235
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,359
deep learning models are not explainable

1236
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,960
you put a ton of features in it you have

1237
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,400
no clue how it got to the

1238
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,079
outcome no one knows

1239
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
uh i have some hope that non-explainable

1240
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,480
models will at least be

1241
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,280
put to kobash on but um i hope hope is

1242
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,520
not a strategy the concept of marginal

1243
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,280
testing doesn't help

1244
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,640
courts are very convinced by

1245
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,119
experts if i show up in my other

1246
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,599
capacity a senior principal engineer

1247
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,920
like well as a judge this this model is

1248
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,200
like

1249
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,359
high quality it's like established

1250
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,280
patterns in the space it is made

1251
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,359
according to the best practices that we

1252
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,200
know the core goes like well you know

1253
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,800
like y'all say so

1254
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,480
this must be true

1255
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,119
i personally am worried about that

1256
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,680
that people would believe me

1257
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,240
in general

1258
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,720
but then people go like what about siri

1259
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
system risk

1260
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
indication who was it

1261
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,599
maxime faberwari uh soon to dutch

1262
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,560
state about like a system like this and

1263
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
people who come to me and say but siri

1264
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,800
you're clearly not a lawyer siri is

1265
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,480
administrative law

1266
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,319
this is criminal law two completely

1267
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,760
separate domains

1268
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,640
have nothing to do with each other so

1269
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,920
we hope

1270
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,319
that some of this wisdom influences the

1271
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,200
criminal courts but i'm pessimistic

1272
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,040
one of the reasons why i'm pessimistic

1273
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
is that

1274
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,319
criminal law has a lot of carve-outs

1275
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
article 2 of the gdpr says this

1276
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
regulation does not apply to the

1277
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,240
processing of data by competent

1278
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,440
authorities for the purposes of

1279
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,880
prevention investigation detection or

1280
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
prosecution of criminal offences or the

1281
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,240
execution of criminal penalties

1282
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
including the safeguarding against and

1283
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,119
the prevention of threats to public

1284
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,520
security gdpr does not apply to

1285
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
predictive policing systems

1286
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,599
gdpr civil law

1287
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,200
completely different domain

1288
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
administrative law completely different

1289
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,920
domain criminal law to the point that

1290
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,400
certain legal terms so for the dutch

1291
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,160
amounts that word hoot

1292
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,640
has a different meaning in criminal law

1293
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
and in civil law

1294
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,240
just just generally

1295
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,960
so

1296
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,480
i am completely

1297
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,520
not optimistic about any of this

1298
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,759
um

1299
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,440
what i am pessimistic about is the

1300
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,960
police is all in

1301
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,640
on this technology

1302
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
they're all in on predictive policing i

1303
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,680
see and i have seen no evidence

1304
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,560
in

1305
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,480
law enforcement circles

1306
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
that anyone's even thinking about this

1307
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,000
especially not in the netherlands in the

1308
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,079
us i have found some papers in legal

1309
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,359
journals where there's some thinking

1310
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,119
about this in holland i haven't seen any

1311
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,400
of that and like

1312
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,720
uh there was a there's a pilot with the

1313
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,520
criminal anticipation system

1314
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,599
16 recommendation at the end of the

1315
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,560
pilot

1316
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,400
15 of those were process and

1317
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,720
organizational measures how to use costs

1318
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,119
better within the police organization

1319
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,839
who should print the form who should to

1320
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,520
recommendation about cash effectiveness

1321
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,560
zero

1322
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,280
thoughts about bias prejudice

1323
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
amplification legal status or the

1324
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,200
desirability of predictive policing

1325
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,280
please is all in on this

1326
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,359
like so i personally

1327
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,839
am worried about this

1328
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
and that's all i got to say thank you

1329
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,680
very much

1330
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,830
[Applause]

1331
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,119
you
