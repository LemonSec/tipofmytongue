[Music]

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,080
next uh next up so the next talk is

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
called knock knock who's there is your

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
door locked are you sure so

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
when a video entry system allows

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,880
unauthorized access jeroen will tell you

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
about it please give him a round of

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,510
applause

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,789
[Applause]

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,399
thank you very much

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,040
i'm indeed jurun hermans and

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,399
let's start with page one from

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
theory and presentations a little bit of

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
audience participation so i hope you're

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
all ready for this so let's start with

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,160
knock knock

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,000
doesn't matter i'm already in

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,559
[Laughter]

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,319
very good um

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,960
so yeah let's uh first talk a little bit

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
about me who i am and how i ended up

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,920
here

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
my and as i said i'm

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,560
my background is in electrical

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
engineering that's what i studied

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,280
and in 2002 i started my own company

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
as a technical consultancy

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
and it is a bit difficult to understand

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
what is exactly what i do because in a

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
word cloud you can see it is a lot

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,799
there's a lot of different technologies

32
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
and this is because i usually go to

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
mostly non-technical companies

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,119
and i solve their technical questions

35
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
about 10 years ago i also

36
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
started a a telecommunications company

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
and as far as i know and please do

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,799
correct me if i'm wrong i am the only

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
telecommunications company in europe

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
that can actually deliver

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,799
emergency services one one two in in

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
every member state in europe

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
um

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
if you want to talk to me uh

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
talk you can find me in the in the swiss

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
village which is exactly there so that

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,239
is that is very convenient

48
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
so let's talk a little bit about how

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,760
this

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
talk came to be

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
well as everyone during kofit i was

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
slightly bored and everyone knows that a

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
board hacker is a very bad thing

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,560
so i was walking through my apartment

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
and i saw this on my wall

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
and i thought

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
interesting what's in there

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
and how does it work

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,599
so about five seconds later

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
it looked like this

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
and i thought uh huh

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
it gets even more interesting so i

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
thought let's zoom in a little bit so i

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,319
did

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,440
and

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
now four wires coming there well two of

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
them from my doorbell

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
so that was not too

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,480
uh too interesting but the other two are

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
from a bus

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,959
and

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,959
i thought that is interesting i want to

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
know more more about this bus

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
every sticker in this device has come in

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
it and i was not

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,760
familiar with the company coming it so i

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
thought who is it and i went on the

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
website

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,920
and i saw

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
this screenshot from their website

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
it they make a video entry technology

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
so basically the device that you just

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
saw

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
and

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
one of their

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
mottos is

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
design technology and security

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
in that order

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
um

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
i thought that's interesting too so

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
there's a lot of interesting stuff going

92
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,159
on now

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
so i thought um okay so i'm going to

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,900
have a look at this bus system

95
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,949
[Music]

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,879
and i found a few things on this bus

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,239
it has dc power on it to power all the

98
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
different phones in the apartment

99
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
building

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
it has audio baseband on it that is

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
interesting because you could basically

102
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,360
hook up a

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
usb audio card on it with raspberry pi

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
and record all the audio on the bus

105
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,280
then at 25 kilohertz which is probably

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
chosen because it's a lot higher than

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
the audio there is binary data and i'll

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
show you a little bit later how that

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,960
works

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,479
and

111
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
the video is also on the bus it is

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
frequency shifted but it is baseband

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
audio uh baseband video

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,639
okay so now we know a little bit of the

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
signals that are on this bus

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,280
so um i'm going to dive a little bit

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
into this first the audio

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
what it is base band audio so

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
it's pretty much as easy as taking the

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
bus

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
low pass filter it put amplifier on and

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
you can use a headphone or evil

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
recording device to

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
uh to use this audio

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
it's extremely easy

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,280
but i also think it is

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
yeah it's it's a very personal data as

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
someone rings the bell and asks my

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
neighbor

130
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
do you want to open the door and they

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
potentially tell their name and stuff

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
like that so yeah i should not be able

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
to receive this

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
so let's have a look a little bit out of

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
binary data

136
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,400
um this is an actual scope picture of

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
the binary data on the bus

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
uh and there's a lot going on so let's

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
uh first see where it starts with this

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
is the so-called preamble

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
the preamble is

142
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
a 25 kilohertz stone

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
this signal is 25 kilohertz

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
it lasts for 3 milliseconds then it's 17

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
milliseconds it's quiet and then the

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,800
address starts

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
and after the address is the actual

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
command sent on the

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
on the bus and then there's a checksum

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,759
now you probably already saw that i say

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
address 48 but 48 is not 4 times 0 1 1

152
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
and that is because it is a least

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
significant bit

154
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
system i'm not entirely sure why they

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
did this it might be because they're

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
using a specific type of processor or

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
maybe they thought it was because of

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
frustration i'm not entirely sure but

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
this is the how they do it

160
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
um

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,080
the checksum uh that is basically the

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,319
number of ones in the packets so in this

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,199
particular situation the green signal

164
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
the green part is the address has two

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
ones the red part is the command has

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
also two ones so the checksum is four

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
and if we take zero zero one that is

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,720
actually four so the checksum is correct

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
after the packet that it has been sent

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
you can see

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
four

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,199
bigger

173
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,520
pulses and those are the acknowledged

174
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,599
basically from from the far end

175
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
okay um

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
so we know pretty much what sort of

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
signal is on there uh now we need to

178
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,039
recover it because there's a 25

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
kilohertz signal on there and

180
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
you know it's

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,680
built length encoded we still don't have

182
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
all the data

183
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,990
and i think it is as easy as this um

184
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,160
[Music]

185
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
it's a it's a pll a phase locked loop

186
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
and what we basically do is we run a

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,759
voltage control oscillator at 25

188
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
kilohertz and

189
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
it is constantly pushed in the correct

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
frequency frequency by the input signal

191
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
the vi

192
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
if we take the output of the loop filter

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
that is basically a dc signal or dc like

194
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
signal and that is a

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
the bits

196
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,800
of of the signal

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
so it's very easy to recover the 25

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
kilohertz binary data from this bus

199
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,879
okay

200
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
so now we have the audio based band we

201
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
can listen to it with the headphone

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
we have the binary data where so we can

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,639
see okay someone

204
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
rang the doorbell for apartment five 5.

205
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,000
so

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
we have to get a little bit into the

207
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
security part and

208
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,759
you probably still remember this part of

209
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,180
the

210
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,280
[Music]

211
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
of the screenshot the design the

212
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
technology and security

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
um so obviously i rang

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
uh comelets

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
and i asked them for a reaction and

216
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,039
their reaction was

217
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,880
we are going to the police because you

218
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
are a hacker that is

219
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
wants money from us and i said no no i

220
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
don't want any money but you know

221
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
discussion became a little bit

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,040
sour so i went to the police and i said

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,399
please

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
don't spend any resources to find for

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
three weeks a evil hacker that is trying

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,839
to extort komalhead it's me and you know

227
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
just call me and they actually really

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
appreciated that

229
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
um

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,440
so basically this bus system it's

231
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
unauthenticated there are no users it's

232
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
unauthorized because there are no users

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
you can also not say this user is

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
allowed to do this

235
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,200
it's unencrypted as we just saw i can

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,240
just see

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,680
who is sending which packets

238
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
it's a broadcast system so for every on

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
the bus i can see everyone's signals so

240
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
i can see who opens the door i can

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
listen in on their conversations with

242
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
the person at the front door and if i

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
would shift the video signal i could

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
actually see the video um

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,000
with a for example usb videographer

246
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
another interesting thing is

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
it has no center verification

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
so for example if you have an apartment

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
building with 10 apartments

250
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
and i just sent a signal on this bus

251
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
hello i'm

252
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
apartment 200 and please open the door

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
it will actually open the door

254
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
so it actually doesn't care who's on the

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
bus

256
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
um

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
so yeah

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
i asked comelet about this and i said

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
so yeah about a year ago

260
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,959
um and i said so

261
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,320
do you want

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
my help on this on are you going to

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,839
change anything on this and i said well

264
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,279
basically we don't think it's very

265
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,000
important what you found because um it's

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,560
um it's not a uh it's not a security

267
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
product so uh so this is this is not a

268
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
big deal

269
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,600
and then i thought

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
really

271
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,040
um

272
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
let's have a look at how come it markets

273
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
this product

274
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
so i found a um on the website of

275
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,959
coleman a press release

276
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
from 2020

277
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
and it actually says

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
comment achieves secured by design

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,000
membership

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
well i've used this wording more often

281
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,839
here and i thought

282
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
that's interesting

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,279
um

284
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
but then again

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
um i during my talk with coleman i also

286
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
said this and i said yeah yeah but we

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,839
have newer systems this is a system from

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
the 90s

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,399
and it's old and i said oh really so

290
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
which percentage of the

291
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
of your systems that you are selling is

292
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,399
still using this system and they were

293
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,519
like

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
it's more than 50

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
so it's still

296
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
very current it's very still very used

297
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
and this bus system is called the simple

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
bus

299
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
and if i zoom in a little bit on this

300
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
press release

301
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,800
yeah you can see

302
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
that two of the door entry systems of

303
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,519
coleman hit are certified for this in

304
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,160
the uk apparently

305
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
and one of them is the two wires simple

306
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
bus

307
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,920
so

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
there's something interesting going on

309
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
here um

310
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
either the the

311
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
board of directors of cobalt holland

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
don't know about his press release

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
or um

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,920
yeah let me put it politically something

315
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,479
else is going on

316
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
so i think definitely in this system

317
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
there's room for improvement let me put

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,560
it mildly

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,480
and

320
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
funny enough today i looked at the

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
website of coleman it and i think they

322
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,920
now think the same

323
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,040
so if you

324
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,920
are looking for a job and

325
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
i can give you a few hints on what the

326
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
job will be in the next two years

327
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,839
okay

328
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
back to the why so i asked comanet

329
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
why did you build it this way because

330
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
it's not that difficult to put some of

331
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,240
the restrictions in there i mean

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
in the 90s it's possible to make

333
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
encryption or do sender verification

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
um

335
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
and i asked them and they said well this

336
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,920
is basically because of the bauber

337
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,560
slides so this is a dutch

338
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
i don't want to call it a law but it is

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
a it is a document that describes how

340
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
you built a house

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
um

342
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,399
and i said if we build our system better

343
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
than is needed in this dutch law the

344
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,800
barber slide

345
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
then we will be more expensive than our

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
competition and we won't sell any

347
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,079
systems anymore

348
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,920
so this is the real reason

349
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,360
that we are doing it this way

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
so i thought let's have a look at the at

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,720
the barber slide and here it is it's a

352
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,959
dutch

353
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,079
website from the government

354
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,199
and it directly stems from article 6.51

355
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,720
and i've translated it for the

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
english-speaking people it says it

357
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
literally says prevention of common

358
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
criminality in a building for living

359
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,040
and this document does indeed not speak

360
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
about any security for the systems that

361
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
are meant for security

362
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,199
so

363
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,720
there's definitely some improvement

364
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
there

365
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
i think it should be

366
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
we have seen in holland in the past few

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
months definitely

368
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,279
a few incidents also with ministers

369
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,880
so yeah

370
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
lots of

371
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
organizations are using the comment

372
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,040
system and

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
safety and security

374
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,399
should be at the top of the list i think

375
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
so

376
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
digitally and analog

377
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
electrically there is

378
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,480
you know some improvement possible but

379
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
surely

380
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,199
physical security in this system is

381
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,079
better

382
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
so i looked at that too

383
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
and here we are so this is

384
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,480
an actual combination

385
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
and at the right side you can see the

386
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
under part of the

387
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
doorbell i'll call it that

388
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
and you can see that it does not have

389
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
any special screws in there you can just

390
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
use a 5 cent screwdriver from any

391
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,399
building material

392
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
shop and just open this up two little

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
screws and you're in there

394
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
that's the left picture that you see

395
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
there

396
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
and indeed again you see this bus there

397
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,600
but you also see other wires and the

398
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,199
other wires

399
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,680
are actually going to the lock

400
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
so

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
i ask combat so what happens if i take a

402
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
paperclip

403
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
and i bridge

404
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,639
the

405
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,600
system

406
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
from the bus to the lock

407
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,680
does it open

408
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
and he said

409
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,560
yes it does but who opens this

410
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,600
i'm not

411
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
okay

412
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
fair point i don't know that but i'm

413
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,560
surely

414
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
there are some really easy measures that

415
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
you can take to improve this

416
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
so how important is it how

417
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,279
i mean is it just

418
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
people's buildings people's

419
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
first front door so you can get in the

420
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
hallway where the where the staircases

421
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
are to the apartments or is it something

422
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
more important is it actually can you

423
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
get into buildings and specifically can

424
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
you get into important buildings

425
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
so i looked into that too so who is

426
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
using komalid it's a lot of buildings

427
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
sometimes it's complete streets

428
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
but i made a nice selection here

429
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,240
of combat systems that i found

430
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,519
and

431
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,720
there are some important customers there

432
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,920
you can see unicef is using it

433
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
as soon as if you at unicef you can

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
actually get into the building so it's

435
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
not just the first door that you get

436
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,959
into

437
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
london it's a

438
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,839
holiday park company they are using that

439
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,000
too and again you can get indoors there

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
too

441
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,040
but maybe the most important one is

442
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
on the right side there

443
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,320
maybe it's a little bit difficult to

444
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,880
read but it actually says reclassiering

445
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,279
and maybe the dutch people now say ooh

446
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
because this is an important company

447
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,199
it is actually the dutch probation

448
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,320
service

449
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
so it is actually tied to

450
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,199
prison system in holland

451
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,559
so uh last week i called them um and

452
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
they thought it was really important and

453
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,839
um

454
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,599
they are definitely going to look into

455
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,559
this

456
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,079
um from other

457
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,280
um companies i've read reply got a less

458
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
than enthusiastic reply and they just

459
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
said you know just

460
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
send an email to the infoad email

461
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
address and yeah we'll see if anyone

462
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,839
wants to look at it

463
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
but

464
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
yeah so there's a lot of negative things

465
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
so i thought um

466
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,120
is any upside to this whole story

467
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,039
well i can think of one

468
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,480
and um

469
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
well it would be really easy to connect

470
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
it to your home automation system

471
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
i mean

472
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,559
uh it's it's really easy to make your

473
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,679
own uh

474
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,240
home automation gateway for this and

475
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
connect it to any of one of these pieces

476
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
of software and you can actually um open

477
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,080
your door

478
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
for someone while you're on holiday you

479
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,480
know if that's would be needed with your

480
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,679
own app

481
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,120
uh without google or amazon

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,280
um having to

483
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
use your data

484
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
um

485
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,600
yeah so i would like to end on a

486
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,559
positive note so kominet did actually

487
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,880
manage to build a system that has a

488
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
really

489
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,400
really open

490
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,799
interface

491
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
thank you very much

492
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,039
[Applause]

493
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
okay

494
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
as there is still some time left if you

495
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
have any questions you can line up at

496
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
the microphones in the middle of the

497
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
room

498
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
okay front microphone please and step

499
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
close to the microphone so that we can

500
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,039
hear you clearly hi thanks for the great

501
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,600
talk um you saw a number of cumulative

502
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
systems in the wild do you happen to

503
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
know whether those were the simple bus

504
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,240
kind or the new probably maybe better

505
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
kind

506
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,320
um the ones that i had in a presentation

507
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,679
here were

508
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,160
very likely the simple bus types

509
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
you can look it up on their website they

510
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
have a very nice

511
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,000
pro.comanetgroup.com website and it has

512
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
all of technical documentation

513
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
the newer types are actually ip based so

514
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
there's definitely a follow-up

515
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
presentation coming on that

516
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
and they are easily recognizable these

517
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
ip based ones

518
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,200
and i see another question

519
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
hello yes i do like this

520
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
how difficult would it be for you

521
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
standing on the street to attach

522
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
something to it

523
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,919
so you ring up all the apartments and

524
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,720
the video signal is for instance rick

525
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,720
ashley

526
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,880
um i think it would be doable

527
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
the audio that would definitely be

528
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
doable

529
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
the binary data called the apartments

530
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
that would be doable although i don't

531
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,960
think

532
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
that you can actually call them all at

533
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,919
once

534
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,460
um

535
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,240
[Music]

536
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
probably because if you call the next

537
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,760
one then the connection to the first one

538
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
is actually cut

539
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,760
because it's a bus system you can't send

540
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
multiple signals uh the video you would

541
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,600
have to actually have to frequency shift

542
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
it so it becomes a little bit more

543
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,640
difficult but probably also doable

544
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
so yeah if everyone anyone wants to do

545
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
that please do let me know because i

546
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
would love that

547
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
yeah we should we should do that do like

548
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
an open source board where you can go

549
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,799
out and then sort of time delay so

550
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
you're out of the place and it'll just

551
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
stop start ringing them one at a time oh

552
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,930
fantastic idea

553
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,120
[Laughter]

554
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
absolutely

555
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
are there any more questions

556
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,440
yes front microphone please again

557
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
do you think that

558
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,880
when they use

559
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
secured screws so that you can't open it

560
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
that easily from the from the seat that

561
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
then

562
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
the problems are at least

563
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,760
mitigated

564
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,640
no

565
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
no it's many many steps that you want to

566
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
take it starts with the screws you also

567
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
don't want the

568
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
door open relay available if you remove

569
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
those two screws

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,520
because you could also use a big hammer

571
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
of course

572
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
so it's many many steps

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
the bus itself you want that more secure

574
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,640
yeah so it's the whole system basically

575
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,960
i mean compared then

576
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,919
a nice large brick that you can throw to

577
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
the window

578
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
yeah absolutely

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
but then again if you sell a system

580
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
specifically say

581
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
security by design

582
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
and you make a system with these kinds

583
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
of properties

584
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,080
personally i would feel bad about that

585
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,570
so yeah

586
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,320
[Music]

587
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
i think the most important thing comedy

588
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
has to do is market it very differently

589
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
now

590
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,559
right thank you

591
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
okay

592
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,039
anyone else having a question

593
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,679
if that is not the case please give a

594
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,690
warm round of applause to the speaker

595
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,390
