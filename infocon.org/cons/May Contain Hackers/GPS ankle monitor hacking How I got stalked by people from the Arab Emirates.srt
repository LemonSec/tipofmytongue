00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080
hello all welcome

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
i'm here to talk about ankle monitors

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
and just at the start of the talk i

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
would like to say that i'm keeping this

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
limited to ankle monitors used in other

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,160
countries

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
because i sort of want to keep some

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
friends here like i might not want to

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
go to a country where i've just hacked

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,320
all their stuff and you know

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
that might be a thing um

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,360
so

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,559
first introduction i'm

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,960
not a security researcher i'm just a

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
developer at a bank at raibo bank

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,600
nice place to work at but

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
yeah i sort of stumbled into this by

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
accident

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
i wouldn't exactly call it an accident

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,479
but it's

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,600
basically

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,920
my partner at the time really wanted to

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
know where i was at the time

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,520
and i kept setting these whatsapp gps

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
links

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
and you know you can track someone for

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
like eight hours and they know what

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
you're doing so eventually

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
i got around to

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,200
um

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
[Music]

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
watching talks on defcon about ankle

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,320
monitors and there was this guy who

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
hacked the ankle monitor and i was like

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
maybe i can do this but better so maybe

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
i can actually make these things usable

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,360
and it turned out i was able to order

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,759
one and i was able to make them useful

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,840
and

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,759
a few years later

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,159
i got the opportunity to apply for a

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
talk here and i did so

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
yeah here i am

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
you can see on the screen the url of my

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
website you can actually download the

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
software you can use these trackers with

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
i'm not saying it's

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,680
perfectly secure or

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
the best code it's a hobby project

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
so

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
if there's any any bugs in it let me

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
know

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
in this presentation i'll just be

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
you know

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
beginning with

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
how how it all started uh

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
basically

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
looking at a cv about gps trackers

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
and

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
examining the different devices and

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,360
different protocols they use and then

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,680
maybe later on the security implications

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
of all that stuff

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
but before i get started let's get this

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,680
thing off

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,159
so that should work

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
so it does actually give alarm

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
i'm not sure how long this is going to

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
last but

71
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,920
so as you can see these ankle monitors

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
really do work for monitoring people and

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
seeing generally where they are

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
so how this all got started

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
um ali express you can actually buy

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
ankle monitors

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
from the internet

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
[Laughter]

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
that should work

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
so you can actually buy ankle monitors

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,519
this is not a very

82
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,920
advanced model it's also not doesn't

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,959
have a great battery life it's just

84
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,360
generally not the best technological

85
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
option if you want to monitor something

86
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
it does work

87
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
and they're freely available so

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,760
these are just a great like way to get

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
started this is just something that's

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
available to the public

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
in this talk i won't be focusing on this

92
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,760
one

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
mainly because technologically it's not

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
that great and the one i was just

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,798
wearing is a lot more effective and a

96
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,400
lot more interesting because it's

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
actually used

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
not just by private individuals

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
so

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
yeah but this is how it all got started

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
and this is how it's going so this is a

102
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,960
box of ankle monitors i have

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
a few with me in the speaker stand so

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
that's kind of how it goes i have

105
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
another one here um this one is actually

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
the one i'm most proud of talking out of

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
a company because it has a metal cuff on

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,639
it and maybe some of you know that china

109
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
had some issues with

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,199
some complaints about their how

111
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,520
humanitarian their prisons were and

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
um

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
it became very difficult to like social

114
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
engineer anything out of china for a

115
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
while especially metal restraints for a

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,560
reason

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
so it took quite some effort to like get

118
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
this sort of beta model of

119
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,400
ankle monitor out of that company but

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,560
it worked so i'm most proud of

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,039
this one

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
so

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,039
we have a cv and i'm sure you can all

124
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
sort of laugh at this this is for car

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
gps trackers

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
and

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
the thing is most of the companies that

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,080
produce the chipsets for these things

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,039
like they also make car gps trackers

130
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,759
there's a giant overlap between the

131
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
chipsets of ankle monitor and what's

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
used in a car tracker

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
so

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
this cv

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,759
might sort of apply to these devices but

136
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
there's way more than just that

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
going on

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
way more because

139
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,639
this is also for ankle monitors also for

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,319
car trackers and

141
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
as you can see you know it's fairly easy

142
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
to access their logging you just have to

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
type in the url

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,199
these slides are available and the data

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
is also freely available apparently so

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
so how did i get this information or how

148
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
did i get this tracker well just ask

149
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
just talk to the company here's a

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,240
conversation i'm having with a

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,400
person from i think this is my rope

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
where they

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,160
produce the watch type trackers they're

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
actually more modern i would say

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
um and more convenient

156
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,400
so here here i'm explaining i have my

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
own platform for

158
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,479
using gps trackers on and they're

159
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
way impressed with

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
how i'm able to communicate with those

161
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
things and

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
you know

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
easily impressed it's nice to be able to

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
uh

165
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
to talk to a company like that and just

166
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
get the information from them you can

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,759
see here that where they're sending a

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
manual this actually includes

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
commands to

170
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,000
set up a device to a server

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,960
so you might um

172
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
yeah you might be able to see how that

173
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,520
can be abused to

174
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
set a lot of those devices up against

175
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
different servers and that's exactly

176
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
basically what i did with this one i

177
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,759
just proxied it

178
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,039
via my own server watched the data

179
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,560
looked at like

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
how does it work

181
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
how does it communicate with their

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,000
server because i just proxied it

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
and

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
i basically copied all the information

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
and wrote a protocol driver for it

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
so yeah and the trick with chinese

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
companies is basically you pretend to be

188
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
a big company you know you're doing

189
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
research

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
trying to find out which device is best

191
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,039
to use and there's different

192
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
manufacturers so you just

193
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
kind of start a conversation talk to

194
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
them ask if you can order samples that

195
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,840
kind of stuff

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
and

197
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
yeah you end up with a tracker sometimes

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
it's way more difficult in this case

199
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,039
and you have to kind of

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
say okay

201
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,039
we're worried about the longevity of it

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,880
you know like the metal strap might be

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,240
sturdier

204
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,399
that kind of stuff so you're gonna have

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
to play innocent a bit

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
but yeah

207
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
that should work and you should be able

208
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,680
to

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
to acquire some of these and it's

210
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,240
actually cheaper to buy them off of

211
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
alibaba than it is to buy him off of

212
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
aliexpress so if you buy them directly

213
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
off of the company or you social

214
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
engineer them

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
you're probably paying like half or a

216
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
third of the price on aliexpress so you

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
know it's worth trying if you want a

218
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,680
whole bunch of gps trackers

219
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,519
the first thing i showed was this one

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,399
this is actually a jimmy

221
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
gps tracker it's a am01

222
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,200
they're actually based on a chipset

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
that's used in cars um if you saw

224
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
some of you maybe saw amon ras def

225
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
contact where he also talks about one

226
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
that's based on car chipsets this is a

227
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,240
common theme the people who produce gps

228
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
trackers

229
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
produce gps trackers for all sorts of

230
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
things including people

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
so

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
this thing is

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
decent as far as usability goes it has

234
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
fairly good battery life like three to

235
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
four days if you configure it right i

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
would say the waterproofing on it is

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
rather poor

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,040
so i would not want to like use this day

239
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
today the one i threw over there has

240
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
much better waterproofing which is going

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
to be useful if you want to take showers

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
frequently

243
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
but yeah this is basically the brochure

244
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,079
for this thing

245
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,160
you can see that it's meant for offender

246
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
tracking it's also actually used for

247
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
that

248
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
it also has a attachment point for

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,240
um where you can basically attach

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
someone to a wall with it with the metal

251
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
version so

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
that's probably why it took a bit to

253
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
social engineer the side of them

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
so um you your jimmy trackers they get

255
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
you weird friends like when you make uh

256
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
post all the

257
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,920
gps trackers right

258
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,640
people might be interested and so

259
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
if i wrote the server for these things i

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
got contacted by this guy

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
so essentially i ended up turning

262
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
or

263
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
letting this guy use my server to

264
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
monitor people and he's using it for

265
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
entirely different purposes than they

266
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,959
were supposed to be used for

267
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,800
but

268
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
i'm definitely not sorry

269
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
for doing this to that company

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
and this guy ended up becoming a good

271
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
friend so you know it's worth it he's

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
also the best beta tester you will ever

273
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,560
have

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
like

275
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,880
if i imagine running around town with

276
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
basically a police siren going off on

277
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
your leg

278
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
like that's dedication

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
so here's the

280
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
video they made themselves on actual

281
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
assembly of this device

282
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
so here you can

283
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,240
see exactly how it's opened

284
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
and it has a few screws on the inside

285
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
so

286
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
fairly hard to reach i would say

287
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,639
it's a fairly standard device on the top

288
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
here you see the gps antenna

289
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
there's a light sensor somewhere around

290
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
here

291
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,839
i think there's a button

292
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
switch somewhere for if you remove the

293
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
pcb

294
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
what they're first going to do is

295
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
disconnect the speaker just so they can

296
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,360
get the case off

297
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
most versions the newer versions

298
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
actually have a bluetooth antenna on the

299
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
outside of the case so you can also do

300
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,760
bluetooth indoor location

301
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
so that's a nice thing to have with

302
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
the fancier trackers some even have rf

303
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
tracking

304
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
not this brand or model but yeah so

305
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
there's tamper detection here there's

306
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,120
basically a switch that goes off if you

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
remove the pcb

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,800
there's actually a light sensor in this

309
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
part

310
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,279
so if you open the case it'll go off

311
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
and if you can see here

312
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
there's the attachment points

313
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,720
for the strap and these attachment

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,560
points they actually have wires going to

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,410
them so there's

316
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,519
[Music]

317
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,639
inductive sensor so it's not that

318
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
there's constant current running through

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,230
it but it does detect if you take it off

320
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,639
[Music]

321
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
i would say with this model it's too

322
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,480
sensitive

323
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,519
so you get

324
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,440
a few false positives

325
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
with that other model that's also not an

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
issue but there's false positives in

327
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
this case

328
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
they do not happen too frequently but

329
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
they do happen

330
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,839
they

331
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,160
do tend to happen with regular law

332
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
enforcement models as well i've heard

333
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,360
so

334
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,720
here you can see him i removed the

335
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,399
battery connector

336
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
simple name

337
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,000
and the antenna to the gps

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
this is all fairly sensitive hardware

339
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
like if you were to

340
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,000
you know

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
cut into it in the right place you could

342
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,519
probably mess with it

343
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
but you might trip the light sensor so

344
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,639
you gotta

345
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
avoid tripping that

346
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
there's ways to do that

347
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
and there's actual um

348
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
most most of the actual chips are on the

349
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
back side so what they're gonna show you

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
now is how to insert this in but then

351
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,240
you can also see the

352
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
chips responsible for the gsm

353
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
the communications everything

354
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
so that's basically the jimmy ankle

355
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,120
monitor and it's nice that they showed

356
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,079
you

357
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,399
overview of the hardware even the board

358
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,680
information everything

359
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
so these are fairly simple and in the

360
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
what you see would see with like the

361
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
ones used in the netherlands like the

362
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
ones used by

363
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
actual cops

364
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
is you would see a fiber optic strap

365
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
instead of the metal one

366
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,079
i would say that the fiber optics both

367
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,360
have less false positives

368
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,320
and there's a you know security aspect

369
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
to it

370
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,959
where

371
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
fiber optics are just generally harder

372
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
to spoof i'm not saying it's impossible

373
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,839
i'm saying it's more difficult to do

374
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
so we have the

375
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
tracker protocol and this is just taken

376
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
from car trackers

377
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
so

378
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
there is actually software track car

379
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,199
which is used for gps tracking cars

380
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
and they have implementation of this

381
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
protocol it's a

382
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,360
more complete implementation but there's

383
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
a few features

384
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,399
surrounding this device and specific

385
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
error cases that are not implemented

386
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
there and that i have implemented

387
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
if you see the software on my website

388
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
all the manuals to this one are included

389
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
all the protocol documents are included

390
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,000
you when i'm gonna show you the protocol

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
documents they might show you

392
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,759
confidential on the site just forget

393
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
about that for a while you know

394
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,199
like

395
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
i don't think it's very confidential

396
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
anymore

397
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
um

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,839
so that that's basically what they do

399
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,720
they're car tracker manufacturers and

400
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
they switched into producing gps

401
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
trackers and there's a lot of companies

402
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
like that

403
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,519
and there's a few interesting commands

404
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,920
in the command manual there

405
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,240
i'm just hoping it'll show correctly

406
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,720
that's my bill

407
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
yep

408
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
there we have it

409
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
so if you

410
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
see the command list

411
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
you can actually query

412
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,359
these commands can all be sent by sms

413
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,839
command to this device so if you have

414
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,679
the cell phone number

415
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,160
you can already compromise it

416
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,520
and

417
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
is anyone here

418
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
familiar with imse catcher

419
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,400
yeah so you guys know how to compromise

420
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,520
these really quickly

421
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,280
[Laughter]

422
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
so that's a thing and these are also

423
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,559
just 2g so they're generally very easy

424
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
to compromise

425
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
like it's

426
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
it's a plain text hd

427
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
plain text protocol sort of

428
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,520
over 2g so

429
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
i sort of see you smiling

430
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,720
this this

431
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
might not be the most secure option for

432
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
a people tracker

433
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
so you can query which server it's

434
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
talking you can set which server it's

435
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
talking to

436
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
so you can just configure your own

437
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,600
server this makes sending commands a lot

438
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
easier because you can send them via the

439
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
server you don't have to pay for each

440
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
message

441
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
but you could also do a factory reset

442
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
from the sms commands

443
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
so if this thing is talking to someone's

444
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,240
server or it has a password you can just

445
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
send it the sms to do factory reset

446
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,919
then yeah

447
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
security leaves something to be

448
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
desired i would say

449
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
this also goes for the car trackers this

450
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,840
manufacturer makes by the way so if you

451
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
contact one of those car trackers and

452
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,720
you send a factory reset command

453
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,440
it will do a factory reset and you can

454
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
actually configure them to talk to your

455
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,159
own server then

456
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,160
yeah

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
you might see issues in that with car

458
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
trackers

459
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,559
some of their

460
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
car trackers can actually cut off the

461
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,080
fuel to a vehicle while it's moving

462
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
so people trackers not much fun if

463
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
they're talking to someone else's server

464
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
and they're malicious car trackers also

465
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
not much fun in that way

466
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
so that's uh

467
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
basically the protocol of these things

468
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,760
or the command manual if you look at the

469
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
protocol document

470
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
i'm pretty sure this says confidential

471
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,559
yep

472
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,200
so it has a complete protocol

473
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
documentation with the login packets

474
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
everything

475
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
a login packet is sort of a weird way to

476
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,440
name it because it just sends the email

477
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
number as a identification and this is a

478
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
team with all these trackers including

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,400
the car trackers they use the email

480
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
number

481
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,679
as the identification for this device

482
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
can anyone see a problem with this

483
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,559
yeah exactly

484
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
you you can look at it um fairly easy

485
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,679
and if you have like imsc catcher you

486
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
already have the mi number especially if

487
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,679
it's a 2g device

488
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,480
which

489
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
everyone can sort of look at the

490
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,600
communications

491
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
so with the email number you can

492
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,159
actually contact the server

493
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,120
and you can pretend to be sort of this

494
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,130
device so

495
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,440
[Music]

496
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,280
i'm not saying that's a smart thing to

497
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
do but that's how it works

498
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
so the full protocol documentation

499
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
whatever it's also on the website it's

500
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,000
included in the archive with the

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,720
software so you can design your own if

502
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,840
you feel like it

503
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
so there's also mega stack trackers and

504
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,840
if you look at this one this is a m2

505
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,720
200x and they're actually used this is a

506
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
site from brazil tracking the world

507
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
and the beam is slightly over the slide

508
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
but you can sort of

509
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,120
guess that this is from

510
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,640
advertising for these trackers so this

511
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
is where they're actually selling these

512
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
to customers

513
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
these have

514
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
sort of the same vulnerabilities the

515
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,679
same sort of technology

516
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,520
one exception the one on the top

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
like on the

518
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,360
left this one actually has a fiber optic

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,919
strap so if you guys want to

520
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,679
experiment with how to break a fiber

521
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
optic strap without tripping a device

522
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
you might want to order this one

523
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
and

524
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
yeah these ones just have a metal strap

525
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
better waterproofing

526
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,919
and a lot of nice features they're just

527
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,600
generally

528
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,679
pretty decent trackers they also

529
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
manufacture

530
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
patient trackers

531
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,799
so you see the wristband there it can

532
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,520
actually monitor spo2 it monitors your

533
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
location it monitors your heart rate

534
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
everything

535
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
these are sold to hospitals and

536
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
psychiatric clinics and they're used

537
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
sort of all over the world

538
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,919
so

539
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
yeah they these

540
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,480
all sort of are based on the same car

541
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,240
tracking chipsets

542
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
and megastack is a more widely used

543
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
brand so you will see this used for

544
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
tracking people for corrections in

545
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
smaller countries

546
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
not in the west you will see this used

547
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
basically all over the world i think you

548
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
see the patient trackers within europe

549
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
though

550
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
but

551
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
the ankle monitors you will not see over

552
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
here

553
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
so here we have a example of what

554
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
scram's now doing this is from january

555
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
2022.

556
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,080
they're claiming this is a very new

557
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,919
fancy idea they have a watch like that

558
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,400
but if you saw the previous slide

559
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,760
that's an old old patient monitor it's a

560
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,480
2g chipset it's probably a decade old by

561
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,720
now so scram is not that fancy or unique

562
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
in

563
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
in this market basically

564
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
so what i want you to

565
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,039
notice about the protocol with megastack

566
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,240
so it has the sort of the same

567
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,559
features you send the sms command to the

568
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
device to set it up and it talks to your

569
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
server and it maintains a

570
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
heartbeat with the server so if it

571
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
disconnects

572
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,120
they know and they can call you and you

573
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,279
know figure out where you are

574
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,440
if you're still compliant that kind of

575
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,760
stuff

576
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,880
they also have a factory reset command

577
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
somewhere in here

578
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,840
in the instructions list you can

579
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
actually retrieve the location from this

580
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
device

581
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,159
with sms commands

582
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
this one you can actually password

583
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
protect i think

584
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
so if you password protect it sms

585
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,240
commands aren't gonna work unless you

586
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
have the password which is a nice

587
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
feature to have but then you can just

588
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
factory reset it

589
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,600
and it still uses the email number as a

590
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,159
identification so it still has the same

591
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
sort of issues

592
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,919
and the same sort of problems you would

593
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,120
have with

594
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,640
this one

595
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
except you have much less in the way of

596
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
false positives

597
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,360
these are much more widely used

598
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,720
and just general better testing better

599
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
waterproofing better

600
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,159
everything

601
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,320
as far as tracking goes even better

602
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
accuracy like you can

603
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
you know run around the

604
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,559
building with thick concrete walls and

605
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,880
these will pick up your gps signal

606
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,919
so that's pretty nice to have these also

607
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
have wi-fi support so they will collect

608
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
all the wi-fi access points around you

609
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
and send them to the server

610
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,679
which is very useful if you want to

611
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,880
locate a person by that but you can

612
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,720
definitely have a great war driving

613
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,960
device with this you know if you

614
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,880
tag a bunch of people and have them run

615
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
around

616
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
so

617
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
now back to

618
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
not to another brand

619
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
think race

620
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,480
and think race is a brand

621
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
which this talk actually got its title

622
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
from

623
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
this person actually lives in the arab

624
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,399
emirates and

625
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,760
she doesn't really strike me as the sort

626
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
of person who would live in the emirates

627
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,559
work in the emirates for a tech company

628
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,360
and then contact someone who

629
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,520
talks on gps trackers you know like

630
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
sorta seems odd

631
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
and

632
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
she works for a government connected

633
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,880
company so

634
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
yeah that's

635
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,640
sort of stalkerish i guess if they start

636
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,679
adding you or like did

637
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,919
so you can all look this person up if

638
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
you feel like it yeah

639
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,279
so this is their uh advertising

640
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
and basically what you can see is how

641
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,120
they

642
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,679
track immigration in the united arab

643
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,799
emirates

644
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,279
fire these watch type trackers they also

645
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
make ankle monitor versions i have some

646
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,840
with me at the speaker desk

647
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
those are also used in emirates

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
and

649
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,120
yeah

650
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
basically this is what a watch like that

651
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,880
looks like

652
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
and they're used for covet monitoring

653
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
they're used for immigration tracking

654
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,678
here's how their platform works

655
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
so here you can see all the happy

656
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
customers with a new uh

657
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
we want to track you watch you know

658
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
this is sort of them explaining their

659
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
immigration procedure and

660
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
how it works

661
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
you also see they used to email

662
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,799
identification

663
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,919
it's a

664
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,039
strong trend in this

665
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
i just really like how they made this ad

666
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
and explained every procedure in the

667
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
entire device

668
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,679
somehow opsec just doesn't register with

669
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,000
them i think

670
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,640
these devices actually work and they do

671
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
work as advertised and

672
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,760
yeah you can set two offenses with them

673
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,679
and the geofences are actually on the

674
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,440
server not on the device so that's

675
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,640
something to keep in mind

676
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,960
so for immigration scope with

677
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,559
quarantines whatever they want to keep

678
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,399
here in your hotel

679
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
so they set a geofence around the hotel

680
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,240
and then you can't leave the hotel

681
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,559
otherwise they get an alarm and then the

682
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,399
cops show up to bring you back to you

683
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,320
wherever you're supposed to be kind of

684
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
like a real ankle monitor except in the

685
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
country where i wouldn't want to travel

686
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,440
to

687
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,679
and especially not now after this talk

688
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,120
so that's sort of how it works tinkrace

689
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,679
also produces devices that monitor

690
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,440
people going on the hajj

691
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
so there might be reasons why you'd want

692
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
to

693
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,399
tap one of these

694
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,279
because

695
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
you know

696
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
if you want to monitor very religious

697
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
people

698
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,559
this is sort of the brand you'd want to

699
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,039
go for

700
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,640
so i could show you the protocol

701
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
documents again

702
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
but i have a question what would happen

703
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,600
if we just send a bunch of sms commands

704
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,320
to people in the uae trying to guess

705
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,159
their cell phone numbers or maybe if we

706
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,399
find a block of cell phone numbers you

707
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,360
know

708
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,399
that would belong to a provider they

709
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,919
used to

710
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,200
communicate with these watches

711
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,960
anyone have an idea do you think we

712
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,919
could

713
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,720
hack all of them

714
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,080
so yeah it's definitely possible and

715
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,159
um you can definitely

716
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,640
find them in the emirates um and you can

717
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
definitely get a response out of them

718
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
so you could set them up against your

719
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
own server

720
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,900
and that's sort of a

721
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,000
[Music]

722
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,760
interesting thing to do

723
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,399
avast actually looked into this and how

724
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,520
they

725
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
some of

726
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
similar devices communicate to a server

727
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
their kids trackers

728
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
these protocols are not that different

729
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
from the kids trackers protocols they

730
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,799
have the same sort of vulnerabilities

731
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,880
i would say the servers in the website

732
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,720
part is better designed

733
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,399
so you your chance of actually

734
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,240
getting into their web servers is

735
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
slightly lower except for the megastack

736
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,960
devices they're the best at hardware

737
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
but their websites just aren't really

738
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
that great security wise like you have a

739
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
default password so it's one two three

740
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,919
four five six

741
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,919
you just log in with your email number

742
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,120
and your

743
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,679
default password and you're done you can

744
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,840
monitor someone so

745
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,720
yeah

746
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,399
that's an issue

747
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
with think race you actually have more

748
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
specific uh sms commands and you have

749
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
fewer of them

750
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
that said they were friendly enough to

751
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
ship me a jtag debugging cable for their

752
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,519
watches

753
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,159
so that's nice of them you know i really

754
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,679
appreciate it

755
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,000
they have two types they have a 2g watch

756
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
which you can

757
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,240
talk let let it talk to your server like

758
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,799
this so you can configure your tracking

759
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,640
server

760
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
so if you want to proxy it or have it

761
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,440
talk to your own server figure out where

762
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
someone from the uae actually

763
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,679
walks around

764
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,720
this is what you can do

765
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,000
and there's actually a

766
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,080
protocol manual in here as well because

767
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,480
they have a binary protocol and i would

768
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,320
find it very difficult to

769
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,279
reverse engineer this by hand

770
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,279
from just proxied requests so

771
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
you know if you want to roll your own

772
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,279
this is definitely useful and i did roll

773
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,760
my own but you know

774
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
here it is so you can guys can sort of

775
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,519
see how this communicates with the

776
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,360
server

777
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
yeah they have a few

778
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
packets i would say the protocol is less

779
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,159
complex than the jimmy version

780
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,000
but

781
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,200
it works

782
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,080
it's

783
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,919
decent enough so here's the type of

784
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,519
packets they have and so login

785
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,840
information again the email number as

786
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,399
they showed in the video

787
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,320
they have a gps information package lbs

788
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,919
information package

789
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,919
they also transmit wi-fi data so

790
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,919
they basically offer the entire package

791
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,399
of like

792
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,200
methods to track someone

793
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
and they also transmit information about

794
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,720
your

795
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,440
blood pressure if you have the 2g watch

796
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,399
your heart rate your spo2

797
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,840
those you can all monitor and your

798
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,760
temperature which is useful if you're

799
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,600
using it for covet monitoring

800
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
so think race

801
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
watch tracker-wise hardware-wise it's

802
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
great

803
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,240
the protocol has the same sort of

804
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,399
pitfalls as all the other ones do so

805
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,919
that's stink race um

806
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,159
yeah i i would say this is a very

807
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
interesting one to

808
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,399
monitor people in foreign countries if

809
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,840
you want to monitor someone but there's

810
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,720
more

811
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,279
so we have the sigson type trackers

812
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,440
they're used mainly in china here you

813
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
can see where they're used

814
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
i also have an implementation for this

815
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
one on the website so in case you want

816
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
to like buy your own from that company

817
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,799
or social engineer your own um

818
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,559
you know they're used for the power grid

819
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,559
they're used for prisons

820
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,480
i i don't know any of these prisons i

821
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,399
haven't contacted them before holding

822
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,720
the stock to see if i could you know

823
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,960
i didn't think that was a good idea to

824
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
do so

825
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,799
here you can sort of see where

826
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,080
these are used

827
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
it's actually a binary protocol and this

828
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,880
one does not use sms commands to set up

829
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,120
the device so it's slightly harder to

830
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,480
hack

831
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,879
but they also gave me jtag cables for

832
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,560
the device so

833
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,800
you know jtag is

834
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,918
fairly nice to debug or just configure

835
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,280
the server

836
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,760
it is talking to and that's exactly what

837
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
you can do if you buy one you could use

838
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,639
their platform or their website to set

839
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
it up against your own server also but

840
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,679
you know

841
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,960
jtag

842
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,839
if you

843
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,760
pretend to be a big enough company you

844
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,000
will get a jtag

845
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
cable for these for free

846
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,079
and they will

847
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,000
they obviously want you as their

848
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
customer you can also upgrade the

849
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,079
firmware with it you can download the

850
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
firmware with it you can modify your gps

851
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
tracker with it

852
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,560
so if you ever end up in one of these

853
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,918
prisons

854
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
you might just want to you know

855
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,160
have friends who can find you one of

856
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
these jtag cables

857
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,599
since you have the full protocol

858
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,920
documentation i'm sure you all can

859
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,200
figure out how to talk to the server and

860
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
tell it that you're in the location

861
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
you're supposed to you know within a few

862
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,800
yards with some random error margin

863
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,000
yeah these are actually used the

864
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,240
execution type trackers i've brought a

865
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
few also um

866
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
in the speaker stance so that's why the

867
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,200
giant bucket of gps trackers i do tend

868
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,680
to actually test them and use them with

869
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,879
the server i've developed

870
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
so it has

871
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,040
all of these devices have multiple

872
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
tracking methods

873
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,640
so you have lbs which is local base

874
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
station

875
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,119
so

876
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,599
your cell phone tower some of them just

877
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,599
send the one cell phone tower they are

878
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,880
connected to

879
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
and

880
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,599
i would say most of them i think the

881
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,160
jimmy ones the

882
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,680
seeks um

883
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,560
the think race and

884
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,200
my rope some of their versions

885
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
send

886
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
multiple base stations so that makes

887
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,119
location easier but lbs is not

888
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,359
the best way to locate someone some of

889
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,520
them have bluetooth like jimmy

890
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
where you have bluetooth beacons they

891
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
place in your house it's sort of like

892
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,320
the rf location you have with

893
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,040
the more western devices the

894
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,960
older versions of the ankle monitors

895
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
they have over here you would have a rf

896
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,800
transmitter in your house somewhere and

897
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,119
they would be able to see over your

898
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,599
phone line back then

899
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,640
where you are located

900
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
around that transmitter based on that rf

901
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,520
signal you can do the sort of the same

902
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,680
thing with bluetooth and a lot of these

903
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,759
devices actually have bluetooth for that

904
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,760
they also have wi-fi and thanks to arch

905
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,359
linux i'll get back to later

906
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,760
and gps of course

907
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
gps is

908
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
by far the most accurate tracking option

909
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,359
you have it's within a few yards so if

910
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
you really want to know where someone is

911
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,359
you prefer gps but wi-fi is sort of a

912
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,400
good fallback because wi-fi geolocation

913
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,440
is also usually within 5-10 yards of

914
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,880
where someone actually is

915
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,079
yeah there are a few security details

916
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
just as far as

917
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
location goes um i have not implemented

918
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,079
this but since they implement multiple

919
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,240
tracking methods you can cross-reference

920
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,880
them and here i'm sort of talking about

921
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
how western devices work but if you

922
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
block your gps signal

923
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,960
a proper server would then look at

924
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,800
your lbs and that's sort of what i do

925
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
here but if you spoof your gps signal

926
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
you can still look at your lbs and see

927
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,880
is he somewhere

928
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,119
within the

929
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,200
area he's supposed to be in

930
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,480
so

931
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
if the gps does not match with the lbs

932
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,000
or the wi-fi geo location you can send

933
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
the alert and you can show okay

934
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,560
someone's tampering with the device

935
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
and this is a security measure you will

936
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
generally not see in the

937
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,000
chinese

938
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
servers or

939
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,400
chinese devices i have not implemented

940
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,320
this it's very possible to do because

941
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,440
you can

942
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
the code is already there to do the

943
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,960
geolocation all you need is a sort of

944
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,079
temporal earth with that

945
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,079
there are multiple attacks on this you

946
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,960
can downgrade one of these 4g devices to

947
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,000
2g so you can jam all the 4g signals

948
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
this is fairly illegal to do

949
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
but you can do it and then it'll

950
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
communicate over a 2g signal

951
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,920
and the 2g signal you can intercept and

952
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,079
you can spoof and you can mess about

953
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,880
with

954
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
jamming is possible because their server

955
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,359
does not match

956
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,240
the

957
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,880
lbs for the wi-fi location to the gps

958
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,040
signal so you can

959
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
mess about with it

960
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,720
some of them actually

961
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,200
shut down the gps

962
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,960
receiver

963
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,079
when there's a wi-fi signal present

964
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,160
that's a bug because

965
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,240
if you shut down your gps receiver when

966
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
there's a wi-fi signal present well my

967
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
phone can send the wi-fi network just

968
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,920
fine i can broadcast the ssid

969
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
from my phone i can broadcast multiple

970
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,079
ssids while i'm driving in my car and if

971
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,400
it's not getting a gps location

972
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
but it's just doing wi-fi location you

973
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,000
would never be able to tell i'm just

974
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,960
walking out with my router you know

975
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,880
it's not that difficult to add like a

976
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,720
backup power supply to your router and

977
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
just walk out the house

978
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,040
so there's a few bugs in there um

979
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,119
that's with xeekson

980
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
with think race you can actually force

981
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,680
it to gps locate and that's what i'm

982
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,920
doing in the software so it's harder to

983
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
fool

984
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,599
the server if properly implemented and i

985
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,640
don't think

986
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,359
the

987
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,839
actual chinese server pulls the same

988
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,119
trick

989
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,359
but mine does so you won't be able to

990
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,760
run away with your wi-fi router in hand

991
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,839
with this

992
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,640
one but yeah that's sort of the trick

993
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,760
between

994
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,839
these sort of devices now if you have

995
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,800
the lbs tracking

996
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,960
you

997
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,560
want to know where the user is

998
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,799
so

999
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,440
if if we're gonna

1000
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
if we have no other options

1001
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,560
so no gps no wi-fi we want to use lbs

1002
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
lbs is accurate within

1003
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,480
a mile ish

1004
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,880
um if you have multiple local base

1005
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,319
stations

1006
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,800
you can be more accurate to within a few

1007
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,680
hundred yards of where a person is

1008
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,760
this is kind of how you do a

1009
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,400
lookup for where a cell tower is

1010
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,839
that's kind of all there is to it

1011
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
the software on my website contains a

1012
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
huge database

1013
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,640
halfway from open cell id halfway from

1014
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,280
other sources with all these tower

1015
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
locations

1016
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
so you can

1017
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,480
look them up really quickly it's also

1018
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
really easy to radix sort them because

1019
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,879
they're

1020
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,480
just

1021
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
binary data it's really

1022
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
efficient to look them up locally

1023
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,720
so it takes

1024
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,599
less than a millisecond to do lbs lookup

1025
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,520
if we can't find it in our own database

1026
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,920
we fall back to google

1027
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,680
and we ask google hey where's the cell

1028
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,440
tower located and google knows

1029
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
everything so

1030
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,599
in order to figure out where someone is

1031
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,680
having these locations we need to

1032
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,119
interpolate

1033
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,119
i used the quick and dirty method i just

1034
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
did a grid grid square optimization just

1035
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,880
walk through the grid squares between

1036
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
these cell towers and figure out where

1037
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,200
the strength is sort of optimal i know

1038
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,359
it's not a linear relationship per se

1039
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,520
but

1040
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,640
works

1041
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,359
well enough

1042
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,040
so

1043
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
the next tracking option and the next

1044
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,160
best tracking option is wi-fi tracking

1045
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,359
the sort of the only provider you have

1046
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,160
nowadays for good wi-fi tracking is

1047
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,760
google and what google does is

1048
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,520
basically whenever you walk around with

1049
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,680
your android phone they collect all the

1050
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
wi-fi networks and your gps data

1051
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,920
and they store it

1052
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,319
and then we can just query it the

1053
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,960
downside is these location api calls are

1054
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,640
fairly expensive

1055
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,160
so it's 28 000 map loads

1056
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,720
for 200 bucks you can see here

1057
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,119
and how often do you think a gps tracker

1058
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,000
connects with the server to notify them

1059
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,960
okay

1060
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,640
i'm seeing these wi-fi networks

1061
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,400
anyone have an idea

1062
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,520
not once a second

1063
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,200
yeah usually once a minute once uh 30

1064
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,119
seconds it depends on how you set it up

1065
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,599
if you want to save power or you want to

1066
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,200
track someone for a long time you might

1067
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,480
set it to three or five minutes

1068
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,960
but there's a lot of minutes in a day

1069
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
and this would get expensive fairly

1070
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,839
quickly

1071
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,040
so i've implemented caching in my server

1072
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,800
usually people are stationary and they

1073
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
stay in the same house caching only

1074
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,520
works if you do not send the

1075
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,599
signal strength because

1076
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,319
signal strength will vary for a lot in

1077
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,839
the same area

1078
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,640
so what i've done with the

1079
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,839
caching is

1080
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,160
i have just

1081
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,000
stripped all of that data sent google

1082
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
the plain wi-fi networks and got back

1083
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,400
the location

1084
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,880
i am unfortunately not that rich and i'm

1085
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,200
not going to be able to afford 200 bucks

1086
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
a month just to track one person let

1087
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,560
alone like 10 people using my server

1088
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
luckily each open source distribution

1089
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
has chrome

1090
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,839
and anyone know if chrome also has a

1091
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,040
location api call in the api key in the

1092
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,680
source code

1093
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,760
yeah

1094
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
you're correct um they have a location

1095
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,560
api

1096
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
code

1097
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,760
in

1098
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,680
the source code for the for instance

1099
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,920
arts repositories so i'm using the arch

1100
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
keys for myself but in case anyone wants

1101
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,599
to

1102
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,280
set this up you know if you want to do

1103
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,760
it cheaply there's ways please don't

1104
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,200
block me

1105
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
i enjoy doing this far too much and i'm

1106
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,359
far too cheap to stop doing that

1107
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,839
um if that doesn't work we fall back to

1108
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,880
the hereto location api it's

1109
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,680
what used to be tomtom it's cheaper

1110
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,359
it's a lot cheaper per api

1111
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,640
call um so yeah wi-fi geolocation is

1112
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,680
efficient gps we all know

1113
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
and we know the security implementations

1114
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,520
of this now i said i wouldn't talk about

1115
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,680
western devices and i have very little

1116
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,119
time

1117
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,680
but i'm just gonna give you guys a small

1118
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,800
hint

1119
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,119
most of these devices in the west have a

1120
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,839
fiber cable

1121
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,078
anyone remember the right picture

1122
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,839
so this strap is bent right

1123
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,079
and it's flexible you can sort of bend

1124
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,280
it

1125
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,480
you know

1126
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,079
so there's a

1127
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,800
ways to inject and extract light from a

1128
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,119
cable like that it's fairly difficult

1129
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,200
and expensive but

1130
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,839
it's doable

1131
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,640
and then there's still the open servers

1132
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,200
you can use

1133
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,040
which i've shown you before and i'm

1134
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,560
gonna skip for now i think because i

1135
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,440
don't have that much time left

1136
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,000
but basically this is the

1137
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,160
live gateway log you can all experiment

1138
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,750
with

1139
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,560
[Music]

1140
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,240
which contains some information on

1141
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,480
the myroap type devices

1142
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,200
including full locations everything so

1143
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,119
remember that url

1144
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,280
you can ask me for it later if you want

1145
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,200
this is a server where they've just you

1146
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,880
know been kind enough to publish their

1147
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,599
logging data

1148
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,720
nice to have

1149
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,720
now let's get back to the actual

1150
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,079
software

1151
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,920
so this is the end product you can sort

1152
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,079
of see where i came from and travel to

1153
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,200
mch

1154
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,399
you can sort of see how fast i was going

1155
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,800
and the battery level of course and

1156
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,960
everything

1157
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,640
you can see the status of the device

1158
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,880
here you can see how many satellites it

1159
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,720
has what kind of connection it has so

1160
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,440
there's a fully working implementation

1161
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,040
of this thing

1162
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,720
here and you can sort of

1163
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,119
see where i'm standing

1164
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,280
at this point point right now

1165
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,440
and you can see an event

1166
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,480
which is

1167
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,440
where i've

1168
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,760
taken this device off and then closed it

1169
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,440
again

1170
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,920
so it has the full functionality you

1171
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,000
would expect of a law enforcement device

1172
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,280
including

1173
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,800
all the geofences whatever

1174
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,680
so that's sort of

1175
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,400
sort of it for what i can demonstrate in

1176
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,800
the 50 short minutes i have the software

1177
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,559
is on my website if you have any

1178
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,599
questions you can talk to me later or

1179
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,079
outside this tent or at the speaker tent

1180
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,599
i would like to thank you all for your

1181
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,120
attention

1182
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,540
[Applause]

1183
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,240
you
