1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:16,800
[Music]

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,720
it's 1500 and we should be starting

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
on our somewhat free format conversation

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
with mari mccarthy

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
on whether it's too late to be

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
pessimistic about climate change

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,239
uh asmari mccarthy has a bit of a

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,920
colored past

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
but his last gig was being a member of

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,640
the icelandic parliament for the ice for

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
the icelandic pirate party but i'm sure

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,039
samara can extend this introduction

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
further

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
okay uh thank you all for coming um

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,680
so yeah the uh i was actually

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
told that i was supposed to give you an

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,480
optimistic talk about climate change um

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,039
and the there was this question of

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
okay first off how does one do that but

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,879
secondly uh is that the talk i would

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
necessarily give

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
and after thinking about a little bit

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
i'm like you know yeah no i think i can

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
actually be fairly optimistic about

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
climate change um

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
but before we can get optimistic we need

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
to really

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
dive down into the pessimism and really

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,040
understand how bleak this can get

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
but then we'll work our way up from

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,119
there

32
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,119
um the way we're going to do this i'm

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
going to give you like a little bit of

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
an intro and then hopefully we can turn

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
this into a bit of a conversation

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
so um

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,640
so just like how do i end up doing this

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
uh well while i was in the icelandic

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
parliament i was

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,720
in part

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
taking care of climate policy for my

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
party and we were

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,159
you know always trying to figure out how

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,200
we could

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
improve things and i started asking

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
these really annoying questions like

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
okay hi we're spending all this money

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,880
like all these governments all around

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,159
the world are spending all this money on

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
trying to fix climate change

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
why are we not fixing climate change yet

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,799
what's the problem why is this hard

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,680
and

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
the deeper i got down into this question

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
and you know i talked to people in the

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
ministries i talked to people in uh

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
business academia i went all the way to

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,440
like the deputy uh secretary general of

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
the un and you know just asking

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
everybody i could find like how how come

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
we're not fixing this

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,200
and one of the things that um became

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,120
clear is

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,920
we don't really know how yet

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
so

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
let's start here

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
um i'm going to start with a quote from

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
a book called uh

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
uninhabitable earth it's by david walls

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,040
wells uh some of you might have read it

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,959
it's actually i'm gonna take two quotes

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,080
and splice them together but he says uh

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,879
at two degrees the ice sheets will begin

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
their collapse 400 million more people

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
will suffer from water scarcity major

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
cities in the equatorial band of the

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
planet will become unlivable and even in

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
northern latitudes heat waves will kill

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
thousands each summer

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,159
then he goes on to say

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
the upper end of the probability curve

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
put forward by the united nations to

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
estimate the end of the century high

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
emission scenario put us at eight

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
degrees warming

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
warming of that level would require a

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
suicidal cocktail cocktail of sadistic

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,959
policy public indifference

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
and catastrophic look

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
at eight degrees humans at the equator

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
and in the tropics would not be able to

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
move around without dying

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
hardly any land on the planet would be

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
capable of efficiently producing any of

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
the food we now eat

96
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,959
forests would be roiled by rolling

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
storms of fire and coasts would be

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
punished by more and more intense

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,200
hurricanes okay so that's the 8 degree

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,360
warming scenario and the 2 degree

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
warming scenario so i think we can

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,720
relatively safely say that the 1.5

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
degree warming scenario that ship has

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
sailed right

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,680
so

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
on on the 1.5 degree warming this is a

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
virtual inevitability we might possibly

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
be able to back back out from that one

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
but it seems very unlikely we're all

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
already most of the way there

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,358
and this is just our reality now right

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,000
the uh the average temperature on earth

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
was 15 degrees celsius when we started

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
this mess now it's going to be about

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,560
16.5 that's if we manage to stop

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
everything now

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
the eight degree scenario is where life

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
is really absolutely

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
okay and not just absolutely but

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
comprehensively

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,000
um

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
but

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,360
here's the good news

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
he said a suicidal cocktail of sadistic

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
policy public indifference and

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
catastrophic luck would be required in

127
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,759
order for this situation to manifest

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
right

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
so

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
okay we probably can't control luck much

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
but let's come back to that one

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,960
but

133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
policy and indifference are entirely

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
controllable right

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
and uh some people are currently

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,479
indifferent and there seems to be a bit

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,440
of a

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
uh shall we say political uh alignment

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
on on that topic

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
uh so as uh so more right-wing people

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
are more likely to be indifferent uh

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
more left-wing people are more likely to

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
be outraged but in general neither is

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
actually helping much to fix a problem

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
at the moment so you know let's let's

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
try and address this in a like useful

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
way

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,199
and

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,960
actually a useful way to think about

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
this is to

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
not confuse indifference with the lack

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
of agency

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
because there are certainly people who

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,479
are indifferent but i think there's a

155
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
lot more people who are really scared or

156
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
at least somewhat concerned who would

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,240
like to fix this problem but don't know

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,199
how

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
much like all of these people i was uh

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,720
talking to about this stuff in in

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
various governments and and whatnot

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,840
so

163
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
um

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
if we are talking about like the

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
literal millions of people in the world

166
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
who would like to do something it

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
might be hundreds millions whatever

168
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,160
what they have in common is they don't

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,639
necessarily know what exactly to do

170
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
they are uncertain what helps

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,240
um

172
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,199
they

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
are somehow being inefficient with the

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
uh money and resources and capabilities

175
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
that they do have

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,000
and you know

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
those are actually sufficient so this is

178
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
one of those things where like we

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
shouldn't attribute to malice where

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
ignorance will suffice but this isn't

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
willful ignorance this is just we don't

182
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
really know how this stuff works yet

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
and broadly uh you know this is

184
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
harkening back to what i was saying at

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
my talk yes yesterday uh whenever it was

186
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
um

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
yeah uh i've lost

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
i've lost count um but uh

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
so

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,039
the the issue

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,759
is not as simple as just

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
reducing the emissions of co2 and

193
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
capturing more co2 it's also this much

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
more complex thing of dealing with

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
processes such as desertification and

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,639
eutrophication of lakes and rivers

197
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,800
and those are much more complex chemical

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
processes and we can't just reduce it to

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,560
a single number

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
and i have this

201
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,759
just

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,680
strong complaint about

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,560
so

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
using co2 as the metric

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
it is a co2 amount in the atmosphere is

206
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
a really good metric for the scale of

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,039
the problem but it is not a good metric

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
for the scale of the solution if we are

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
only measuring the solutions by how well

210
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,680
they remove co2 from the atmosphere then

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
we're going to be missing things such as

212
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
ecosystem failure uh you know mass

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
extinction events things like that

214
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
and not to mention the certification

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
uh

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,599
that are actually very problematic

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
quick question the interject

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
isn't the scale of the solution not

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
equally important as the complexity of

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
the solution

221
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
yes

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
okay so if you want to talk about scale

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
um

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
so

225
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,879
yeah sure uh but okay so

226
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
the certification globally it's about a

227
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,319
hundred and twenty thousand square

228
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,960
kilometers per year uh that's about uh

229
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
just

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,599
just slightly more land than iceland

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
it's also about three belgiums

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
uh we're running out of belgium's uh

233
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
uh

234
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
one switzerland yeah that's a good

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,159
metric and it's also going to annoy the

236
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
swiss so i like it um but

237
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
um so

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
that desertification isn't coming from

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,519
one source it isn't just the heating um

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,160
the vast majority of it is due to over

241
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
grazing or an agricultural uh over

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
extraction of nitrogen and nutrients so

243
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
there's a thing where like you can

244
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
actually catalog the

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,519
the causes and about half of them are

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
social and the other half are

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
somehow need an engineering solution

248
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
and as far as i can tell nobody's really

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
working on the engineering side of

250
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
things on a large scale

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
everybody's working everybody who's

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,519
working in this field is working on

253
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
trying to teach

254
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
farmers and other experts to be better

255
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
at uh doing their uh their thing

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
so

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
the two big anti-desertification

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
projects that are that are

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
kind of ongoing

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
one is in china the other is

261
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,320
the great green wall project in africa

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
that one's hardly started the chinese

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,240
one is actually going pretty well so

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
that's great um and the um but the

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
biggest success story that i can point

266
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
at is that um

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
in 19 in the 1950s iceland was a

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
complete wasteland and now it's only

269
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
partially a wasteland so you know we've

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
made progress

271
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,640
but

272
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
um

273
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
if i just quickly go back to the

274
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
policy side of things

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
and

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,519
yeah so

277
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
so i i'll i maintain that people

278
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
generally want to help

279
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
people want to fix this the fact that

280
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
we're all here is evidence of that and

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
the fact that there's events like

282
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
extinction rebellion and whatnot you

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
know

284
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
organizations

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
you know of all sorts is evidence of

286
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
that and if you talk to politicians even

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,600
they are kind of like yeah no we need to

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
do something

289
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
their failing is more that they don't

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,399
know exactly what to do

291
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
so bad policy which would be one element

292
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
of our uh cocktail

293
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,560
uh

294
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
bad policy comes from lack of

295
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,640
understanding it comes from insufficient

296
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
or incorrect information it comes from

297
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
conflicting priorities

298
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
and

299
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
often traditionalist arguments and then

300
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
sometimes political bad faith

301
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,440
now

302
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
having worked in politics for a few

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,160
years i can tell you political bad faith

304
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
is nowhere near as common as we would

305
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,680
like to believe

306
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
it's so easy to say oh that guy is an

307
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600


308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
and everything he says is just like

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
he's just

310
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
shilling for the something or other and

311
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
sure there are people who are like that

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
but most of them are not

313
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
and it's super helpful for any

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,079
conversation to assume some good faith

315
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,760
and and especially again here ignorance

316
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
and

317
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
the insufficient and incorrect

318
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,839
information is sufficient to explain

319
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,920
it another question here how does

320
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
identity politics figure in this

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,399
equation for you

322
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
now you're just trying to take us off

323
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
track

324
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,079
identity politics

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,760
is

326
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,079
largely getting in the way of solutions

327
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,440
uh so

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
one of the things that that has been

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
happening i'm not saying that identity

330
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,680
politics is always bad but it uh there

331
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
is an element of it which causes people

332
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,279
to um to kind of uh heighten the

333
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,079
otherness of of their adversaries and

334
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,680
especially when we're talking about like

335
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
the political right um

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,279
so

337
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
for instance there was a colleague of

338
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,959
mine in the in the icelandic parliament

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
uh from a

340
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,399
far right-wing party

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,880
um you know and generally i didn't

342
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,720
really like agree with him on a lot of

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,279
things but when he left parliament

344
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,920
politics he went to work for the un

345
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,639
convention on uh desertification uh

346
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,800
combating the certification because you

347
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
know he actually felt that was an

348
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
important thing

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,000
so you know there's some good there even

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,360
in in the far right people

351
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
you you have a

352
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,279
yeah i would like to yeah uh question on

353
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,240
the

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
on on policy uh i mean

355
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
there's many emerging economies uh which

356
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
will which will manifest themselves in

357
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
the upcoming years uh their needs are

358
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
probably more focused on you know

359
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
yeah

360
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,360
leveling the playing field getting

361
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
getting up there being competitive in in

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
the world market do you consider that

363
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,399
not a hazard to yeah to to uh also

364
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
combating climate change yes

365
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,160
uh absolutely so uh this is where i

366
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,279
mentioned com conflicting priorities so

367
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,279
uh when you hear of china uh saying oh

368
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,040
we're going to have to spin up this many

369
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,720
coal plants just to keep up with our

370
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
energy production needs

371
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
you know yes that's terrible and it's

372
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,519
terrifying and it's really

373
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,399
counterproductive but at the same time

374
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,519
like

375
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,760
you know and i i'm no fan of chinese

376
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,279
policy neither nationally or

377
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,839
internationally or whatever uh but they

378
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,240
are actually a country that has uh

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
defined very clear

380
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
goals and very ambitious goals with

381
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,600
regards to carbon reduction so

382
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
like there's one of those things where

383
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
yes what they're doing the you know more

384
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
power plants is actually bad

385
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
but at least they're explaining why

386
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
they're doing it and what their plan is

387
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,720
to stop doing it and so uh there's

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
something where one of the things that

389
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
we can do is

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
hopefully help develop better

391
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
technologies more technologies that can

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,639
make the transition faster and easier

393
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
so china at the moment just one moment

394
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
uh china at the moment is uh has the um

395
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
largest amount of uh solar panels in the

396
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
world like so they're doing the best on

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
that front well but we're giving a hard

398
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
time because they have a growing middle

399
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
class who want to have electricity in

400
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,639
their homes you know like i think we

401
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,040
should try to find find ways of being

402
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,199
helpful there rather than necessarily

403
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
always being in the attack mode the

404
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
other thing i'll say on that before i

405
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
hand mike to walter is

406
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
in international trade my favorite quote

407
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
of all time

408
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,360
comes from

409
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,079
the

410
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
indian negotiator at the

411
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
original gat

412
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
agreement

413
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
where they were talking about whether

414
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
there should be preferential treatment

415
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
for developing countries

416
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
and this guy said

417
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
um

418
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
let me get this right because it's it's

419
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
so nicely worded um

420
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,600
equity is no equality is equitable only

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
among equals

422
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,880
right equality is equitable only among

423
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,839
equals

424
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,040
um so

425
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
treating all countries uh the same way

426
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,199
and holding everybody to the same

427
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,480
standard is going to be very evil and

428
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
counterproductive and when we're looking

429
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,399
at countries like china and

430
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,040
india in particular that have a long way

431
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,279
to go in terms of energy production

432
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,680
capacity and just bringing their middle

433
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
class up to a better wealth and life

434
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
standard let's also bear in mind that

435
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
like the closest thing to we've had uh

436
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,880
recently to a uh serious mass death

437
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
event due to a wet bulb temperature

438
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
hitting 31 degrees celsius uh where it

439
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
becomes the air basically becomes

440
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
unsurvivable it's a it's a sauna where

441
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
people just die

442
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,880
that was in tamil nadu about a month ago

443
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,199
in in india they hit 29.7 degrees so

444
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,000
like

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
indians understand the need to fix this

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
so let's let's try to be nice and give

447
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,759
them a break but try and help everybody

448
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
along the way because turns out we all

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
share one atmosphere and you know we

450
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
definitely need to make progress but

451
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
let's let's try to

452
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
be equitable not just equal

453
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,079
yeah

454
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
and to follow up isn't there an

455
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
opportunity to just leapfrog fossil

456
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,360
fuels for especially for africa

457
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,959
by going straight to solar pv

458
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
yes and this is kind of where i wanted

459
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
to turn this into a conversation so

460
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,600
um what i

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,959
you know what i started with was this

462
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
quote from david wallace wells and and

463
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
his definition of

464
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,079
uh the

465
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
um let me find that wording again

466
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
um

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
the suicidal cocktail of sadistic policy

468
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
public indifference and catastrophic

469
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
luck okay

470
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
now um

471
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
just to like say regarding luck

472
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
luck is

473
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
actually just what we call a failure to

474
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,679
understand statistics right uh if we

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,360
understand statistics there is no luck

476
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,520
anymore there's just uh playing the game

477
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,039
correctly right

478
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,520
so i'd say let's turn this into a bit of

479
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
a conversation about things like

480
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
leapfrogging um you know

481
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
the the petrochemicals

482
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,679
about all of these different

483
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,039
technologies and all these different

484
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
methods that would help

485
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
but focus on how do we reduce public

486
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
indifference how do we avoid sadistic

487
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
policy and how do we

488
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
improve our understanding so that we

489
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
don't have to rely on on

490
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,200
not having catastrophically bad luck

491
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
right does that sound like a good plan

492
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,360
and uh if we do this correctly the the

493
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,240
way that the outcome of this uh comes is

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
i'd like it if we could take some notes

495
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
i don't know exactly how we can do that

496
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
yet um i mean we could use this i

497
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
suppose but um

498
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
but

499
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
uh

500
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,200
but

501
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
what yeah so the ask here is let's not

502
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
just be techno optimists on here because

503
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
let's also look at the politics and the

504
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,320
reality the real politics of people

505
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
having different constraints different

506
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
needs different

507
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
competing interests and let's try to be

508
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,120
humane about it because like look we're

509
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
all going to suffer if we this one

510
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,919
up so maybe we can like in a nice

511
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
friendly way come up with a set of good

512
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,440
policies good technologies and and so on

513
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
that don't assume that everybody is

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
going to be a like um

515
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,120
you know

516
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,919
a

517
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,360
bike riding vegan uh hug the gay whales

518
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
type of person like that would be great

519
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
but we're not going to get everybody in

520
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,240
the world to do that so yeah all right

521
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,679
question um like co2 reduction is is

522
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,600
important but i think the

523
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,480
the co2 we emit today affects the

524
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,880
climate in like 10 or 20 years from now

525
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
so so what we are suffering right now is

526
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
from cot of the past

527
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
so

528
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
how can you um

529
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
like c2 reduction right now won't

530
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
necessarily

531
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,520
prevent climate change on this moment

532
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,679
because it's already emitted

533
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,120
so how

534
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
would we

535
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
yeah is it necessary to reduce certain

536
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
to avoid climate change in in the future

537
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
yeah

538
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
so

539
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,880
okay so the the thermal buffers of the

540
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
planet like the atmosphere um so

541
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
yeah and the oceans the ocean is a much

542
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,600
bigger buffer but it's also much slower

543
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
moving um

544
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,240
uh

545
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,120
so

546
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
they they store uh heat but uh the the

547
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
co2 in the atmosphere now yes it's it's

548
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,120
old co2 that's um that's causing the

549
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
problem now but it's because it's been

550
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,559
accumulating over time so we're making

551
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,200
quick movements now can actually uh fix

552
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
things relatively quickly we don't

553
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,400
actually understand how quickly but um

554
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
so i'm not

555
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
super super concerned about that

556
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,400
but yeah so okay uh we got indifference

557
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,280
we got uh

558
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,440
ah

559
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
sadistic

560
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
policy

561
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,039
and we got um

562
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,720
bad luck

563
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
catastrophic look

564
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
okay so your task

565
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
let's fill these in with uh ways of

566
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,559
flipping these in our favor

567
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
right for all humanity

568
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
anybody want to start

569
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,820
a catastrophic look

570
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,039
[Music]

571
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,280
bad luck

572
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
[Music]

573
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
so for indifference i'm thinking

574
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,360
that

575
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,039
people should bear the consequences of

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
their own behavior in some kind of way

577
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
there should be like a feedback loop

578
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,439
like um

579
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
the time gets hot they will take a

580
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
holiday

581
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,039
so

582
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,480
yeah so in

583
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
using

584
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,520
economic incentives or regulatory

585
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,559
incentives oh yeah okay

586
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,799
so

587
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
good thing right do you know what i mean

588
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,000
yeah yeah

589
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,720
but uh but there is maybe uh tracking

590
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
externalities

591
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,440
like you know if we uh

592
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
if we look at like um you know

593
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,400
deforestation

594
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,000
on a large scale a lot of uh the reason

595
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
deforestation and like

596
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,880
you know certain other industries work

597
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,520
is because the industries themselves are

598
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,600
not made to pay for the externalities

599
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
the oil industry is uh the most

600
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
massively subsidized industry in the

601
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
world and that's not even counting the

602
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,679
externalities right

603
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,640
so

604
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,200
uh so externality

605
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,559
yeah

606
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
i was saying so to counter indifference

607
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
one of the things you can do is

608
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
internalizing the costs that are now

609
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
external to

610
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
so that you're actually paying for uh

611
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
the footprint of

612
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
the things you're using right

613
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,799
yeah and then also include

614
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,520
the

615
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
lesser known

616
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
parts of this cost like logistics and

617
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,440
storing stuff and

618
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
get get the whole chain of the product

619
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
that you're using

620
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
get it incorporated in these co2 tags

621
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
yep

622
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
so there's uh

623
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,159
work there being done on like uh

624
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
tracking you know smart smart logistics

625
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,320
chains that kind of thing so yeah um

626
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,039
i i put extra internalized externalities

627
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,760
under policy because it sounds

628
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
less of an issue about public

629
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,279
indifference and more about like making

630
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,120
sure that rules are good

631
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
yeah can we just actually

632
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,799
define indifference because

633
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,000
i think taxes and punishments as we want

634
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
to call them yes work on say companies

635
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,000
but

636
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
taxes on individuals to

637
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,960
combat indifference is regressive

638
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
so incentives on individuals as in us

639
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
are not so i wanted i want to define

640
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,080
what we're talking about when we talk

641
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
about indifference yeah

642
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
so uh

643
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,799
yeah so and uh and i think in some ways

644
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,279
this is kind of the pr aspect like you

645
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,960
know it's uh

646
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,480
so let's imagine um

647
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,159
we're talking about the public yeah

648
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,960
yeah can we shoot monroe makes it easier

649
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,799
if it just takes the person with the

650
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,600
microphone talks

651
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,159
yeah okay so um

652
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,279
let's let's take like i i want to

653
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,960
make a caricature

654
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,679
here for a moment like uh you know

655
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
imagine imagine the person who has

656
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,520
uh who is least concerned about climate

657
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
change of all people

658
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,400
right

659
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
now

660
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
i i think you all have roughly the same

661
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,840
idea uh it's going to be a white man

662
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
probably in his uh

663
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,640
50s 60s uh 70s 80s yeah

664
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,360
he's going to be you know reasonably not

665
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
necessarily wealthy but

666
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,360
sufficiently well off right

667
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,559
he's going to live in the west he's

668
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,200
going to possibly live in a rural area

669
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
and

670
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,159
his indifference where does it stem from

671
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,039
but

672
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,760
so

673
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,919
if if it doesn't affect him

674
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,760
so he doesn't care how do we make that

675
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
person care like i'm not saying force

676
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
him to care but like figure out a way to

677
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,320
assist that person in caring

678
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,039
and

679
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,440
so i i actually occasionally talk to

680
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,120
people like this and

681
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,320
uh what i find is that they don't they

682
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,000
it's not even that they

683
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
uh don't

684
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,640
uh

685
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,559
care per se it's that they just don't

686
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
believe that it's actually a problem and

687
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,840
you know

688
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,960
like i i heard this guy saying like um

689
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,679
yeah you know what even if this is real

690
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,520
what's greta tunberg going to do about

691
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
it and it's like come on you know this

692
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,720
is a adult guy you know he's supposed to

693
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,760
know better than you know but he really

694
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
uh simplified it down to this level

695
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
and i'm like no no look they're climate

696
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,279
scientists they actually know what

697
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,320
they're doing

698
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
um you know

699
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,080
this is real we've measured it

700
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
why don't you care and

701
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,679
so

702
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,360
what what kind of incentives would work

703
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
on that kind of person

704
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,640
you do you wanna

705
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,120
also i don't think this uh i don't see

706
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
where the basis that the idea that

707
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,159
penalizing

708
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
even regular people i mean obviously if

709
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,720
we you know quintuple the cop the price

710
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
of meat

711
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,080
uh this isn't really going to affect

712
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
people's like it's going to change the

713
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,080
cost of that you know if we can con

714
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,159
quintuple the cost of gasoline it will

715
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,320
have slightly more impact but it will

716
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
ultimately end up beneficial

717
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,039
that's an argument that comes from

718
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
privilege people need to be able to eat

719
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
and drive themselves around and do all

720
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
kinds of things punishing people for

721
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
those

722
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,919
for living their lives especially if

723
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,520
they're poor i think is extremely

724
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,600
regressive i specifically singled out

725
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,480
meat

726
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,799
yeah but

727
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
you said meat meat

728
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
yeah okay

729
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
um

730
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,960
okay so uh

731
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
should we talk about food for a moment

732
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,559
okay so global food production so it's

733
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
about 5.4 billion tons of meat it's

734
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,279
about 6.3 million billion tons of

735
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,679
vegetables a year a few hundred million

736
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
tons of fish

737
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,799
you know

738
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,640
and and then what

739
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
like

740
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,000
uh which part of the food system can we

741
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,919
can we actually optimize and again let's

742
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,520
take it through through this

743
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
do we have sadistic policy that's making

744
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,840
making our food systems

745
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,000
worse uh

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
yeah okay so what what do we do here

747
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,279
okay

748
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,000
so

749
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,880
okay you could do that um but could we

750
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,360
maybe uh also think about the way in

751
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,240
which

752
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,399
monocultures are extracting nitrogen

753
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,440
from soil in in unsustainable ways uh

754
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,720
how reliance on on

755
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,240
industrial fertilizers are causing

756
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,880
the the microbiomes in the soil to

757
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
basically not produce

758
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
not buying nitrogen right

759
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
so i think

760
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
just not subsidizing uh

761
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
stopping subsidizing the meat industry

762
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
alone is insufficient it's probably part

763
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,919
of the answer but what's a big answer

764
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,039
well i i think we have also to uh

765
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,360
um

766
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,320
the the the food for the animals is also

767
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
a big problem because uh the uh a lot of

768
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
times uh rainforests are cut because

769
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,080
they have to

770
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,679
uh to build that that kind of food uh

771
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,679
monocultures uh

772
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,159
somewhere in

773
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
southern america or somewhere and um

774
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,399
so uh i think uh probably we should

775
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,720
forbid to import that kind of stuff if

776
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,440
it's uh if it's a very uh

777
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,679
um

778
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,720
if it's produced in a way that

779
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,279
um that's very very bad for the for the

780
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,600
climate and for for the nature yeah

781
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,720
we'll do this

782
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
okay yeah so i i think um

783
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
just

784
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
even without addressing like the meat

785
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
industry and pointing the finger there

786
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
putting stuff local and making sure that

787
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
food for animals is produced locally you

788
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,880
have a closed loop especially also in

789
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
the netherlands we have this nitrogen

790
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
problem which is exactly this problem

791
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
it's

792
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,200
nitrogen that is harvested in brazil is

793
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
brought over

794
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,760
here and is added to the system and then

795
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
you you have an excess and then instead

796
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
of using that fertilizer you use

797
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
artificial fertilizer for growing the

798
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
crops that you'll eat so if you make any

799
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,240
kind of like

800
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,480
farming for animals also land bound and

801
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,399
say that the loops have have to be

802
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
closed the the cycle has to be closed uh

803
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
locally that is already a big improve a

804
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,520
systemic improvement uh apart from the

805
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,919
fact that you need to scale down a lot

806
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,090
of these uh things so

807
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,320
[Music]

808
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
yeah

809
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,919
i think the big issue here is

810
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,080
as you mentioned monoculture

811
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
crop growing but i don't think the

812
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
solution is involved in making sure that

813
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,200
the monoculture

814
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,279
the the crops grown for

815
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,200
animal feed are by definition going to

816
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,159
be cheap and the same and ubiquitous so

817
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
you're not going to solve that problem

818
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
by just

819
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
making it locally instead of

820
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,760
in other places and shipping it

821
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
so the the policy would need to be

822
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,159
specified towards

823
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,440
ensuring that

824
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,559
more varied and diverse crops are grown

825
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,159
in fields which is by definition not a

826
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,159
simple

827
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,840
policy to make

828
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,799
yeah so uh just to note uh we're using

829
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,519
these uh microphones as indicators of

830
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,159
who can talk partially because we're

831
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
using them to record for the stream but

832
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,919
uh when

833
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
it's not amplified in here so speak up

834
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,880
if you're uh talking um just to add to

835
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,799
that point um

836
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,039
the

837
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,399
so

838
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,440
there are definitely uh

839
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,919
one of the reasons we seem to be doing

840
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
monocultures on a large scale is because

841
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
all of the um so after the green

842
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,039
revolution we've had

843
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,960
much better access to industrial

844
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
fertilizers and been able to scale up

845
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
those processes and hyper optimize them

846
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
but now we're realizing that that was a

847
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,200
local optimization it was like an

848
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,559
optimization trap and maybe you know now

849
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,080
people are talking about things like

850
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,399
regenerative agriculture which is

851
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
fantastic but we don't know how to scale

852
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,080
that up yet so if anybody's got ideas

853
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
yeah so the monoculture when i think of

854
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,960
that i also think of monsanto who grow

855
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
seeds and

856
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
pesticides which only work together

857
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,000
and there's a lot of regulation to

858
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,919
protect their intellectual property

859
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,720
there's different ways of growing seeds

860
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
i think the netherlands is a is an

861
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
example of that but i'm not too keen on

862
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,640
the details where you can use each

863
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
other's seeds to

864
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,600
create new seeds again and there's a

865
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
like it's an open source model on on

866
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
seed creation and i think we could use

867
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,760
more of that too because i think

868
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
monocultures are due to companies like

869
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,399
monsanto

870
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,120
also fertilizers take about two percent

871
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,600
of the global energy use

872
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
i think it's

873
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,840
probably best to have the system uh

874
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,039
monetize

875
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,960
the guys that do the good things

876
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
and create a policy on that

877
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,640
so if you could do like a permaculture

878
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
food garden and you grow things there

879
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,399
you sell it from there then you get

880
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
subsidized and if you do it in a

881
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,200
less good way in a in a greenhouse large

882
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
greenhouse with heated with

883
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
russian gas and using industrial

884
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,240
fertilizers then these

885
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
also vegetables should be more expensive

886
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
more expensive than than the well-grown

887
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,919
ones

888
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,080
that's discussion all separately from

889
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,840
the meat but only the vegetables but

890
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,279
yeah i think that's a way to

891
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,039
incentivize

892
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,440
people to to buy the good stuff

893
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
but it doesn't answer the question or

894
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
scaling up

895
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,720
right yeah this is actually a really

896
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,000
important point that walter brings up uh

897
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
yeah

898
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,000
but uh so specifically one of the things

899
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,919
all of us rely on whether we are happy

900
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,199
to admit it or not is um like

901
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,079
we're getting foods on a regular basis

902
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,719
like i live in iceland like if if i were

903
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,480
only eating local food there it would

904
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,800
become very monotonous there would be no

905
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,719
avocados there would be very few berries

906
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
it would be you know like it would it

907
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
would not be a fun time

908
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,639
so much of the food that we eat is

909
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,040
reliant on global supply chains so i

910
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
think the next thing we should go to is

911
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,839
uh transportation uh because you know i

912
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,159
i do like this talk about the food

913
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,560
system but the other part of the other

914
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,159
side of the food system is the

915
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,760
distribution channels

916
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,119
and on that uh like you know we we have

917
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,239
shipping we have uh cargo freight on on

918
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,359
uh

919
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,119
trains and such we have aviation um uh

920
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,960
you know that always becomes a hot topic

921
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
but um

922
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,119
but yeah anybody else on agriculture

923
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,960
yeah okay uh yeah so uh recently there

924
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,640
was a report of a long-term study on

925
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,839
agriculture and especially fertilizer

926
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,960
use and

927
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,880
mixing some of the kind of things we

928
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,079
know from permaculture like

929
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,760
nitrogen binding

930
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,599
crops

931
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,760
cycling over fields together with using

932
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
manure

933
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
and

934
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,720
also mixing with

935
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,880
artificial fertilizers and the effect

936
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
was actually that this

937
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
improved

938
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
harvest from the current

939
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
mainstream big models so they're

940
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,839
definitely at least in some transition

941
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,000
uh hybrid models possible that have a

942
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
higher or similar yield to

943
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,240
what we now would call traditional

944
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,800
agriculture so there definitely

945
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,040
is uh promising research in that respect

946
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
what what is very important i think is

947
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,119
that the farmers get

948
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,200
get a fair price

949
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,119
for the products because

950
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,160
then they they also are uh capable to

951
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,640
uh to invest in new technologies and uh

952
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,520
to

953
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
perform with greenhouses to to use the

954
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,599
warmth from the summer

955
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,760
and and store it in earth and

956
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
get it back in the winter for example so

957
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,040
but now that it's not it's not possible

958
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,599
that they're really uh getting much too

959
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,880
low uh

960
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,440
price for the products

961
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,359
okay so made make food more expensive i

962
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,359
yeah i mean i don't disagree

963
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,160
with

964
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
this you know and this is a balancing

965
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
act

966
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,560
supermarkets

967
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,079
okay we can figure that one out

968
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,800
there's a few like there's i think two

969
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
more and then

970
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,200
trans transport will be here

971
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,040
i just think it raises an interesting

972
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
point that was raised earlier that i

973
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
think is central to the whole discussion

974
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
which is the fact that there needs to be

975
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,839
a massive price adjustment and a massive

976
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,640
negative externality price adjustment

977
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
happen for this whole thing to work

978
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
however

979
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,640
if we were to as you say make the

980
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,560
farmers earn the correct amount for the

981
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,119
crops if we were to stop subsidizing the

982
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,520
oil industry and stop subsidizing

983
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
um

984
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,160
all their industries

985
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,079
then people would have to start paying a

986
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,400
lot more for things that they're used to

987
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,079
not paying as much for which would

988
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,240
increase in inequality quite

989
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,880
significantly i believe so

990
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,640
in in the department of statistic

991
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
policies i think there needs to be some

992
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
way of

993
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,860
making the

994
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,200
[Music]

995
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
negative externalities that are

996
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
currently not being paid for

997
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,040
to be not paid for equally by everyone

998
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,960
that is the poorest

999
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
percentage of people do not need to pay

1000
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
the same amount for gas or other things

1001
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,800
such as those that have higher income or

1002
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,560
everybody pays the same amount but the

1003
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
money used from these

1004
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,720
raised taxes is used to subsidize the

1005
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,040
existence of those that cannot afford to

1006
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,920
live otherwise because we cannot simply

1007
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,040
eradicate the poorest part of the world

1008
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,240
and then

1009
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
expect to go on i mean that's not the

1010
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,640
way to be

1011
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
isn't it

1012
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
well

1013
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,799
he

1014
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,800
um i actually just wanted to mention a

1015
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,240
couple of good projects that i've heard

1016
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,760
of that are doing really cool

1017
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,720
development on uh helping farmers track

1018
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,800
the price throughout the entire supply

1019
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,040
chain and specifically on luxury crops

1020
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
like vetiver so food is one thing right

1021
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,440
we all need to eat food but a luxury

1022
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,000
crop like vetiver that makes perfume

1023
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
like that's a really amazing one to

1024
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
track through and incentivize the

1025
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
farmers to keep the veteran in the

1026
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
ground for longer

1027
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,240
because it's become a cash cash crop so

1028
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,839
they pull it out of the ground

1029
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,200
incentivizing them to keep it in the

1030
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,119
ground for longer increases the quality

1031
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,800
of the vetiver which also increases the

1032
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,680
price of a luxury product overall um but

1033
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,560
there's also certain like incentives and

1034
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,480
benefits to the soil as well so this is

1035
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,320
a haitian project that's doing really

1036
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,079
well so there are projects out there

1037
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,520
that are doing really cool stuff about

1038
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
helping farmers track the price just

1039
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,880
thought i'd kind of a little bit of good

1040
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,960
news out there

1041
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,119
yeah and that's actually a good point

1042
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,200
the the goal of the session was to be

1043
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
hopeful and and positive and i think we

1044
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,680
are generally going in that direction

1045
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,960
but i you know

1046
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
so projects like that are exactly the

1047
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,240
right kind of thing i definitely want to

1048
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,200
hear about a lot of them uh but i i

1049
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,920
think this framing is about like not

1050
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,000
just how do we hope blindly but how do

1051
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,800
we generate hopeful scenarios right

1052
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,160
so did you

1053
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,940
one of you had a

1054
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,039
[Music]

1055
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,920
sorry um well actually uh it ties in a

1056
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,680
bit with uh which was said before um

1057
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,119
that um

1058
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,079
pay the farmers better is is kind of a

1059
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,359
good idea

1060
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,520
but the reason why farmers are not

1061
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,440
feeling paid well

1062
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,200
is because of the entire financial

1063
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,319
structure

1064
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,960
around the industry right

1065
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,920
which is

1066
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
essentially driven by

1067
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,319
pure profit motives

1068
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,280
profit for the profit

1069
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,440
and i think

1070
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,960
as long as that is a driving factor

1071
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,440
of our food system

1072
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,000
or many other things as well probably

1073
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
that's never going to really get solved

1074
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,440
i think

1075
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,359
and then i'm going to jump in and kind

1076
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,680
of jump out of my role as facilitator as

1077
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
soon as you talk about profits for the

1078
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,599
people not profit for profit you end up

1079
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,359
having identity politics and roughly

1080
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,040
half of society will just tune out and

1081
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,640
say off hippie

1082
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,000
and yes and and that is not helpful on

1083
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,680
the indifference side of the equation

1084
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,280
i mean

1085
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,599
without without any other

1086
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
basically food production should the

1087
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,280
goal of food production should be food

1088
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
production not making a profit

1089
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
making a profit is a means to assure

1090
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,960
that food production

1091
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
so uh so i i'm loving how excited people

1092
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,560
are about things um uh

1093
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,240
one point on lesson and i'd like to move

1094
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,640
on to like transportation uh side of

1095
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,440
things a little bit uh but uh i put in

1096
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,800
land reform here and so have any of you

1097
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,480
read a book called how asia works

1098
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,079
okay so it's very good and one of the

1099
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,480
things that they point out there is

1100
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,440
that what if you look at the

1101
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
successful economies in asia they one of

1102
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
the things that unites them is that they

1103
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
all went through massive land reform

1104
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
after world war ii

1105
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
and what that did was it

1106
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
caused farmers and

1107
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
to generally have much less land

1108
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,319
and that led to them being way more

1109
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,160
productive on the land right and so

1110
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,480
maybe you know land reform and i mean

1111
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
this in the context of of agriculture

1112
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,520
but also

1113
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,319
how we treat urban environments how we

1114
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
how we organize land in general might be

1115
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,520
one of the things and of course as a

1116
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,680
you know recovering anarchist i uh i

1117
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,480
feel the need to point out the land is

1118
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,040
one of the grand the great monopolies

1119
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,599
that we need to be countering so

1120
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,079
but yeah urban stuff uh and

1121
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,839
transportation

1122
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
transportation exactly easy

1123
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,800
yes

1124
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
okay okay here we go okay so we talked

1125
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,760
about uh local production i'm from the

1126
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,119
fablab community i believe also in

1127
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,720
global design

1128
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,960
and so if we are

1129
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
setting up the sessions that we have

1130
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
here and we maybe have some politicians

1131
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,560
or a country

1132
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,000
that is open to experiment i would uh i

1133
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
would suggest global design

1134
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,000
and local production

1135
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,119
okay so yeah this is the old fablab

1136
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,720
mantra of uh

1137
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,200
design locally emerged globally

1138
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,880
and so i helped work on well i

1139
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,400
got the first fab labs in iceland

1140
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
started and uh

1141
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,200
yeah and uh managed to make the uh make

1142
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,480
it a

1143
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,200
policy in iceland that every secondary

1144
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,720
school should have a fab lab associated

1145
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
with it that was part of what my partner

1146
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,040
was doing so this is right i would like

1147
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,359
to go more into global design but you

1148
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,240
have a

1149
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
point yeah i was going to say helpful

1150
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,119
things about transport but now we're

1151
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,200
derailing into this conversation bring

1152
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,119
it um now i

1153
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,760
first want to respond to that remark

1154
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,079
fab labs are fantastic for prototyping

1155
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,440
stuff

1156
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,480
for

1157
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,000
anything that

1158
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,280
is at prices we've grown used to

1159
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
we have to go back and look at henry

1160
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,480
ford well henry ford was not even the

1161
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
inventor of mass production but he was

1162
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,160
the first to do it for

1163
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
let's say high-end consumer good like a

1164
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,119
car

1165
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,760
that is something fablabs cannot do for

1166
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
mass production you still need two parts

1167
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
of your questionnaires and that is you

1168
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,520
have your

1169
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,440
um

1170
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
you you have certain raw materials that

1171
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,400
you can only produce at scale you cannot

1172
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
have a steel mill in your fab lab if you

1173
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,760
want to use steel to produce anything

1174
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,280
or a paper mill or

1175
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,000
you could have a fab lab in a paper mill

1176
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,359
the paper mill itself is already an

1177
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,520
industrial scale operation

1178
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
at scale in and you want to do forestry

1179
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,760
at scale as well

1180
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,839
um too much in the weeds but

1181
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,000
yeah say again you're

1182
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,800
going on for too long okay

1183
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,240
i'm talking too much i i i i'll fear uh

1184
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,760
you have been waiting for this literally

1185
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,640
11 years to tell me um but the uh the

1186
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,800
other bit i want to hear back to

1187
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,839
um transports accept aviation and

1188
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,119
aviation is roughly two and a half

1189
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,599
percent of carbon emissions so as much

1190
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,760
as i hate bloody scribble and now

1191
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,720
everything

1192
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,240
related to that

1193
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,640
it is not our biggest problem

1194
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,680
shipping

1195
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,400
especially long distance shipping is

1196
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
nasty with bunker oil once you switch to

1197
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,680
lng and there are other options wind

1198
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,720
could easily be recast in

1199
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,880
relatively easily it's a but it's more

1200
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,079
of an engineering problem than a

1201
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,839
fundamentals and it has to do with

1202
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,200
certain incentives in the shipping

1203
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
industry that's not happened yet

1204
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,560
but the current supply chains that reach

1205
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,280
into east asia and back

1206
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,079
can be made carbon neutral without

1207
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,480
changing drastically the last mile

1208
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,359
shipping can be electrified the only

1209
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,599
hard nut really hard not to crack would

1210
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,160
be aviation but like i said aviation is

1211
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
in terms of transport

1212
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,599
more of a footnote than a major issue

1213
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,560
so

1214
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
and that's actually good news because

1215
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,680
the more you have the change in your

1216
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,920
supply chains in the way you work the

1217
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,800
more resistance you will encounter

1218
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,359
i i i would add to that that

1219
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,119
you know people like to complain about

1220
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,440
the aviation industry because everybody

1221
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,960
sees the planes in the sky and is very

1222
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,680
strongly connected with ideas about like

1223
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,720
um you know

1224
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
luxury and yeah but uh it is yeah around

1225
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,079
two percent to uh

1226
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,319
either side of the two percent mark

1227
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,240
and the aviation industry because

1228
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,599
they're always under this kind of

1229
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,520
criticism and scrutiny are actually

1230
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,839
trying to improve themselves so i i will

1231
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,359
kind of defend them a little bit not

1232
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,240
just because i like flying uh but um

1233
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,040
but

1234
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,000
you know i hate flying and i will still

1235
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,079
say it's relatively speaking a footnote

1236
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,040
but the uh that said you know i like it

1237
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,440
when we do when we're hard on people

1238
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,079
like in that way and like uh alice talk

1239
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,560
yesterday uh where she's just like

1240
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,119
trashing uh you know all sorts of things

1241
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,520
like that it's like you know even if i

1242
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,960
don't necessarily

1243
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
fully agree we need to apply that

1244
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
pressure right so um

1245
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,880
on that note um so i

1246
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,680
went to visit ulsan in korea a couple of

1247
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,560
years ago and there i visited the

1248
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
largest car factory in the world which

1249
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,079
spits out one new car every three

1250
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,319
seconds

1251
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,200
and

1252
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,680
next door to it is largest fish

1253
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,319
ship factory in the world and there i

1254
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,640
was visiting amongst others with uh with

1255
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,599
a guy who's the head of a very large

1256
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,920
international shipping corporation uh

1257
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,400
and they were laying up uh i think it

1258
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,760
was like 14 15 new ships cargo ships

1259
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,920
each of which was supposed to take 13

1260
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,480
000 container units

1261
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,000
and i asked the guy

1262
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,760
have you considered

1263
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,599
powering them by nuclear instead of

1264
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,559
diesel and it was like no why would we

1265
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,640
do that

1266
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,480
so how do we address this kind of

1267
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
indifference i mean you know and we've

1268
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,160
been very much on the policy side i

1269
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,319
think there might be a like a slight

1270
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,359
rules

1271
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,319
oriented thing here but like how do we

1272
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,720
make people who are at the top of the

1273
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,880
shipping industry go like hey maybe we

1274
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,720
ought to decarbonize our shipping fleet

1275
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,839
maybe internalize the cost of

1276
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,599
uh

1277
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,400
of of carbon energy into into into the

1278
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,839
energy price

1279
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,559
so

1280
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,000
it eventually all comes down to

1281
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,800
internalizing cost

1282
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
and it needs to be

1283
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,359
put in into financial in what

1284
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,720
what reaches people which is their

1285
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,920
finances

1286
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,440
yeah okay

1287
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,520
so we do have uh there's an

1288
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,079
international agreement thanks uh about

1289
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:42,960
um

1290
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,640
uh

1291
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,400
so using crude oil on ships in

1292
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
international waters so that's been

1293
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,000
progress uh

1294
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,359
that's now not allowed um whether people

1295
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,280
are actually enforcing it that's another

1296
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,000
question but um but that is one step

1297
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
towards internalizing those

1298
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,640
but

1299
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,079
so so just a a few random facts not not

1300
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,280
really uh

1301
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,640
anything

1302
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,720
useful so there is actually one nuclear

1303
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,640
powered shipping vessel operating the

1304
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,680
soviet russia has one but it doesn't um

1305
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,359
it's generally it's not allowed to go

1306
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,240
into port so it has this design where it

1307
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
can carry these light they call them

1308
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,559
lighters they're they're smaller ships

1309
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,480
that that can then it can lower and

1310
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,079
they're basically barges and somebody

1311
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,200
tows them into port but there's a bunch

1312
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,040
of legal complexities around that so

1313
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
that is solving that problem of having

1314
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,640
the shipping ship that doesn't actually

1315
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,720
go into the port and having that be a

1316
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,240
reasonable thing for people to do is how

1317
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
you would it's the main thing to get the

1318
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,480
nuclear working the other problem is is

1319
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,280
that the the shipping companies

1320
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,800
actually these giant container ships

1321
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,359
they don't build them to last that long

1322
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,720
um and if i the reactors like at least

1323
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
the military reactor like the reactors

1324
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
that the us military uses might last

1325
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,280
longer than the these ships i'm not sure

1326
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,640
so uh

1327
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,160
it

1328
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,680
obviously that should be fixed too but

1329
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,400
that's just stuff these are just

1330
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,720
all right thanks

1331
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,680
um your question about um how do we you

1332
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,359
know encourage

1333
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,680
the shipping guy to think differently

1334
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
i know a few of you here have heard me

1335
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,800
have these like signal rants in the

1336
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
morning um and i don't have an answer

1337
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,000
and i'm curious to see if the room has

1338
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,599
an answer just about how we encourage

1339
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,599
more long-term thinking because i think

1340
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,359
there is a lot of short-term thinking

1341
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,599
both in in terms of how we tackle

1342
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,119
climate change we're just in everything

1343
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,640
right like

1344
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,000
gas prices and all these things and

1345
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,920
we're not really encouraging long-term

1346
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,119
thinking to see seek those solutions

1347
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,800
um and i don't know what the answer is

1348
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,079
i'm really curious if anybody does

1349
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
because it's a grand frustration of mine

1350
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,480
one small thing if you were we're

1351
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,680
interested in making the nuclear

1352
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,520
shipping thing work

1353
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,000
france's france is a very has a nuclear

1354
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,680
industry that they really like and maybe

1355
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,440
you should try and get convince the

1356
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,480
french that they want to have a

1357
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,280
nationalized shipping fleet

1358
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,599
so if our if our solution to climate

1359
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,880
change is trust the french

1360
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,359
i'm

1361
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,960
a few random facts about nuclear

1362
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,720
shipping is stupid

1363
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
first of all yes first of all of course

1364
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,800
you need miniature reactors and the

1365
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,359
smaller reactor the higher grade

1366
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,599
the fuel is and it will basically be

1367
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,599
close to the weapons great that's one of

1368
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,760
the reasons well they have these lovely

1369
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,160
tiny nuclear reactors in submarines but

1370
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,400
they're all military submarines for

1371
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,480
nuclear proliferation purposes the idea

1372
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,640
of having liberian flagged

1373
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,559
container ships having

1374
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,359
a

1375
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,880
submarine

1376
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,760
in the great nuclear fuel on board

1377
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,839
i am not looking forward to that

1378
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,680
particular perspective that's with

1379
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,839
traditional reactors not like modern uh

1380
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,078
ceramic uh uh

1381
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,040
so

1382
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,920
pebble

1383
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,000
pebble or some bad reactors are actually

1384
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,920
a bloody dead end because pebble battery

1385
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,680
guys turn out to be worse than the

1386
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,280
previous generations

1387
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
okay they're really shy safety wise

1388
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,760
because they make cause the graphite the

1389
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,000
pebbles are made of graphite and the

1390
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
temperature shrinks and expands so they

1391
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,680
create graphite dust

1392
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,000
which is the least yeah

1393
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,680
lovable substrate

1394
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,839
yeah yeah

1395
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,520
yeah but basically long story short

1396
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,680
before i get to give to anger

1397
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
nuclear is shite in general especially

1398
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,680
at small scale

1399
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,599
i would say look into the figures for

1400
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
example two kites there's at least one

1401
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,119
hamburg startup

1402
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,119
you can already replace at up to six

1403
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,960
megawatt using massive kites that are

1404
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,119
automatically steered for the big

1405
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,920
container ships you need about 30

1406
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,000
megawatts and

1407
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,400
that's not a terrific big terribly big

1408
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
jump to go that from to go for wind when

1409
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
you're really offshore yeah

1410
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
okay yeah yeah yeah

1411
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,720
i agree with walter

1412
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,079
we should uh we should not

1413
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,280
run into

1414
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,119
uh using other non-renewables for

1415
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,440
shipping we should go to

1416
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,400
to renewable energy sources like like

1417
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,599
wind or

1418
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,079
even solar probably i don't know how

1419
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,119
good is it is possible on ships

1420
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,920
that probably has to be researched but i

1421
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,440
think wind

1422
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,240
will will certainly be uh

1423
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,319
possible

1424
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,400
okay um

1425
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,000
yeah i

1426
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
i'm slightly more optimistic about

1427
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,559
nuclear but uh i i do understand the

1428
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,040
drawbacks that are being mentioned

1429
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,240
um

1430
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,720
but yeah

1431
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,759
oh uh

1432
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,599
i was going to suggest that rather than

1433
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,400
the solution to to the shipping problem

1434
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,200
is

1435
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,880
don't ship stuff

1436
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,319
build it

1437
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,800
make it closer to where it's needed as

1438
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,520
much as possible

1439
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,200
like 3d printing very good idea

1440
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,400
no exactly

1441
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,599
and

1442
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,359
people aren't going to be happy with it

1443
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,800
but maybe 3d printed tomatoes one time i

1444
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,880
know i'm responding to something

1445
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,200
i heard here saying they're not made to

1446
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
last and

1447
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,839
that makes me think of planned

1448
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,839
obsolescence yeah

1449
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,960
companies

1450
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,720
companies profit

1451
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,680
from

1452
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,520
constantly having renewed

1453
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,040
consumer cycles

1454
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,000
and that seems to be a very hard issue

1455
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,240
to fix because how are you going to

1456
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,640
revamp the whole economic system in one

1457
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,520
go it's it all it all entails

1458
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,839
many other systems and uh it's just

1459
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,359
world reform actually what you need but

1460
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,200
i don't know how to solve it if anyone

1461
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,000
has as the slightest of ideas

1462
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,240
i would love to hear so yeah no this is

1463
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,960
a really good point and also i i

1464
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,440
discovered that i really rely on uh

1465
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,760
autocorrect when i uh you write the word

1466
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,440
obsolescence so

1467
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,680
uh sorry sorry but um

1468
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,720
uh but

1469
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,480
so one of the ways we deal with that is

1470
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,040
better a stronger consumer uh protection

1471
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,160
laws uh and in particular warranties

1472
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,880
right longer warranties basically uh

1473
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,200
force uh longer term uh things but um

1474
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,720
but one of the things that always

1475
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,640
happens and this is kind of like the

1476
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,319
trap function type thing is if you are

1477
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,240
if the warranty is required to be three

1478
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,480
years then all of the equipment all of

1479
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,760
the things are going to be designed to

1480
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,920
last three months three years in one day

1481
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,359
right

1482
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,599
and you'll be very skewed so they don't

1483
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,920
end up accidentally to you know breaking

1484
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,400
two years and uh

1485
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,680
three and twelve eleven months right um

1486
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
so the question is

1487
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,160
not just how do we lengthen warranties

1488
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,240
and that's something that should be

1489
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,920
relatively easy to advocate for in the

1490
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,960
european level european union loves

1491
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,720
messing around with consumer protection

1492
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
law but

1493
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,799
the other thing is how do you

1494
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,079
disincentivize this you know warranty

1495
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
length plus one day behavior

1496
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,400
and that's

1497
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,680
kind of

1498
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,040
partially belongs in the indifference

1499
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,400
category but

1500
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,960
and also how do you how you do how you

1501
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,839
how do you foster reuse repair uh

1502
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,440
recycle uh kind of behavior

1503
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,960
i mean

1504
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,400
could this be done with some kind of

1505
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,280
like tax policy that essentially was

1506
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,200
meant to like drive

1507
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,400
recycling and other things so

1508
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,440
essentially

1509
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,240
after the after the product line at some

1510
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,760
point the eu some eu thing says okay

1511
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,040
this product has

1512
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,079
has been eol we believe roughly speaking

1513
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,880
and so we're going to impose this tax

1514
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,359
and this tax on the manufacturer based

1515
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,760
on sort of how much was eoled when and

1516
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,440
blah blah blah is that at all saying

1517
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,799
no uh so actually i i kind of like the

1518
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,119
the direction you're going in here so

1519
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,799
the the good news was uh around um

1520
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,440
right to repair in europe uh somebody

1521
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,960
here probably knows the details this a

1522
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,200
lot better than i do but uh but the

1523
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,720
right to repair is actually making

1524
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,640
progress in a lot of places

1525
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,599
so that's good but regarding that idea

1526
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,960
so

1527
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,960
in

1528
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,160
there's a lot of places that still do

1529
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,640
like tax incentives for electric

1530
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,680
vehicles

1531
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,440
but um

1532
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,520
one idea that's come up is is kind of

1533
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
flipping the script on that and say

1534
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,799
rather

1535
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,880
let's pay people a higher amount of

1536
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,960
money to take older vehicles that

1537
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,920
pollute a lot out of the out of

1538
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,799
distribution like um you know

1539
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,799
basically make there be fewer

1540
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,640
bad vehicles on the road rather than

1541
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,520
paying further to be more supposedly

1542
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,119
good ones right

1543
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,920
so how about we do that on a slightly

1544
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,720
bigger scale and just start to provide

1545
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,960
uh tax incentives for

1546
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,599
uh using equipment

1547
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,319
for longer periods of time

1548
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,640
so we want to get rid of the old clunker

1549
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,799
cars that are polluting a lot

1550
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,599
but we probably want people to live in

1551
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,160
older houses because the most

1552
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,240
carbon efficient houses is the one

1553
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,359
that's already built right

1554
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,879
not necessarily okay yeah okay

1555
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,920
concrete one sport is a co2 absorbent

1556
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,440
the problem is the production of the

1557
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,200
cement beforehand

1558
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,680
my problem my the my cup season i will

1559
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,599
get back to the remarks just made before

1560
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,280
my scraps is about the house already

1561
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,079
built is the most carbon uh and it's

1562
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,160
actually not true because especially in

1563
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,400
the climates in at these latitudes you

1564
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,799
will burn so much fuel in heating the

1565
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,640
house that sometimes it's actually

1566
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,200
better to demolish it and replace it

1567
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,480
with a new net zero house

1568
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
as a general remark about tax incentives

1569
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,920
and so forth

1570
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,720
do realize when you make policy

1571
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,839
it's always best to make give tax

1572
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,760
incentives or

1573
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,680
penalize behavior

1574
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,440
at a essential place as possible so your

1575
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,720
supplier of your low quality plasticky

1576
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,760
goods

1577
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,640
will

1578
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,799
probably at the european level not be

1579
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,520
the manufacturer but an importer that's

1580
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
someone you can talk to but by the time

1581
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,000
that plasticky crappy product is at the

1582
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,079
ends of life the person holding it is a

1583
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,440
consumer

1584
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,119
and the manufacturer will be sitting

1585
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,720
somewhere in southeast asia because

1586
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,040
that's the world's workshop currently

1587
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,760
and therefore is out of reach for your

1588
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,839
so the moment you want to touch that

1589
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,920
supply that life cycle of the product is

1590
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,520
at the point of importation into the

1591
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,920
european union

1592
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,839
so

1593
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,319
yeah i have two comments but i think the

1594
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,880
the first one i have is still uh about

1595
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,559
the discussions five minutes ago about

1596
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,880
transport ships etc and the second one

1597
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,200
is about concrete i think if you think

1598
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,480
about the learn long term um

1599
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,160
somebody told me that concrete using

1600
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,359
concrete is um

1601
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,520
is yeah in beginning really really bad

1602
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,359
for the environment but if you use it

1603
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,280
more than 50 years it's even better to

1604
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,359
use concrete than than wood or something

1605
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,080
else

1606
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,159
[Music]

1607
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,839
[Music]

1608
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,319
is in many ways provided that this has

1609
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,839
been forested in in a sustainable way

1610
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,000
so assuming sustainable forestry

1611
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,200
practices

1612
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,040
wood is way better cement is really

1613
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,839
really shite because

1614
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,599
it's actually worse than steel per ton

1615
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,040
in terms of co2 emission

1616
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,200
but a lot of cement use could be

1617
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,119
replaced by boots

1618
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,960
so

1619
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,119
engineer engineerable though so more

1620
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,000
modern

1621
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,640
uh

1622
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,960
lumbers basically anything a few meters

1623
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,040
above ground level could

1624
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,119
easily even into a high rises there's

1625
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,240
currently

1626
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,119
a 80 meter tall building in norway which

1627
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,000
is made out of engineered lumber and

1628
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,680
we will probably see within the next

1629
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,640
decade

1630
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,200
wood buildings raising uh higher than

1631
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,880
100 meters

1632
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,680
so

1633
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,160
for uh for normal buildings for utility

1634
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,920
buildings slightly different or

1635
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,839
especially for civil works like viaducts

1636
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,280
and so on

1637
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,599
that is more out there but for

1638
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,760
housing and

1639
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,079
office buildings wood is a very

1640
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,839
interesting solution to construction

1641
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,119
materials

1642
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,799
maybe go

1643
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,200
have another idea for all products that

1644
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,839
actually uh are supplied with the energy

1645
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,079
label right now maybe

1646
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,000
put on the energy label the expected

1647
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,640
life cycle of this product also yeah and

1648
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,960
then if you put this expected life cycle

1649
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,039
the the customer knows what to expect

1650
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,280
and then also what the energy user or

1651
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,839
the co2 usage or whatever

1652
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,319
you can derive that from that and also

1653
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,760
maybe

1654
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,640
include some warranty statements in that

1655
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,400
so we have that on light bulbs but it

1656
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,599
would be nice to have it on everything

1657
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:10,799
else right

1658
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,359
so yeah could you pass up cars on

1659
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,078
washing machines

1660
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:17,760
i think

1661
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,480
we must think about which products to

1662
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,200
reuse which products to recycle

1663
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,280
and which products just to break down

1664
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,880
that

1665
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,440
for example uh furniture

1666
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,920
if some old people die or go to a

1667
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,240
nursery home or something and and there

1668
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,960
is a lot of furniture often very good we

1669
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,200
we can reuse that that's no uh that

1670
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,599
that's that doesn't consume any energy

1671
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,599
and it's better to reuse this

1672
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,119
but uh if it's a electronic uh

1673
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,640
uh probably

1674
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,520
the new the new um

1675
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,760
uh thing what would

1676
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,920
use much less energy so

1677
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,880
um it depends on on the live site you

1678
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,039
have to to look at the at the special um

1679
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,400
thing you

1680
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,520
uh you want to to recycle or anything

1681
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,520
but

1682
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,880
for example um mobile phones

1683
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,640
it's catastrophic

1684
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,520
how

1685
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,880
long the life cycle is

1686
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,880
but but you could you could uh you could

1687
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,280
recycle them but you should use them for

1688
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,799
much longer

1689
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,720
um on the other hand

1690
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,359
about houses well you have also new

1691
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,599
materials like uh

1692
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,160
very old materials in fact straw and

1693
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,960
clay to bow to to build houses so that

1694
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,880
that seems to be very

1695
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,119
energy efficient as well

1696
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,400
so we should

1697
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,680
use that much more

1698
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,240
i just would want to say a really quick

1699
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,359
note about

1700
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,000
concrete and renewable materials like

1701
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,280
the type of sand that we use for

1702
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,039
concrete we're rapidly running out of it

1703
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,480
um and it's finite so we can't kind of

1704
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,319
just grow it like we do with trees so

1705
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,160
that's just another reason to kind of

1706
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,760
just throw that out there

1707
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,640
so um could you so if instead of just

1708
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,799
labeling for life's life cycle you could

1709
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,039
augment the vat like you could have the

1710
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,680
vat increase with the shorter life cycle

1711
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,680
and then um

1712
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,440
okay and then there's there's another

1713
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,039
thing so

1714
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,680
it's very i mean phones are i'm not sure

1715
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,760
that's that big of a problem but it

1716
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,559
phones specifically because you know if

1717
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,079
they have a sim card in them you you

1718
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,520
could charge the you could make the

1719
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,680
carriers charge higher taxes if the

1720
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,280
phone is younger

1721
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,240
so

1722
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,000
yeah uh

1723
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,920
i i think things like that are very

1724
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,160
difficult and especially so one one

1725
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,680
thing i learned during my time in

1726
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,119
politics is uh that um tax authorities

1727
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,440
really really hate it when you mess with

1728
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,559
tax policy like um it's just complicated

1729
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,480
for them and i'm not saying we shouldn't

1730
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,240
do it but we need to be very specific in

1731
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,480
how um

1732
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,400
one note we've been going on for

1733
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,200
slightly over an hour uh

1734
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,359
we i think we have one more hour is that

1735
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,240
right yeah so i don't necessarily want

1736
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,599
us to use the full extra hour just for

1737
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,599
shits and giggles i think we need to be

1738
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,799
a little concrete but one thing is

1739
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,640
we've been very focused on the sadistic

1740
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,480
policy and actually how to make a less

1741
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,119
sadistic policy nobody has talked about

1742
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,440
how we improve our luck no and very

1743
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
little about the indifference except for

1744
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,680
the incentives i did actually uh write

1745
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,839
the life cycle expectations into there i

1746
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,119
think that's a really good way of

1747
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,079
powering uh like consumer sentiment uh

1748
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,640
and i wrote down conversations because

1749
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,799
conversations like this one are i think

1750
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,319
a massively good antidote to

1751
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,480
indifference but they

1752
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,640
only they sometimes end up preaching to

1753
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,359
the choir a bit so

1754
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,160
yeah so

1755
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,079
i wanted to comment a bit on the tax

1756
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,640
incentives because i think it's often

1757
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,160
overlooked especially also by

1758
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,559
politicians that well every tax

1759
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,960
incentives and etc uh

1760
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,480
drives like

1761
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
is counterproductive in that there's

1762
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,000
some kind of like pricing issue um both

1763
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,799
because it's more complex but also

1764
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,799
basically for instance with

1765
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,319
electric cars

1766
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,200
prices for electric cars in countries

1767
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,599
where their tax incentives are generally

1768
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,119
higher than in countries where there are

1769
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,359
no tax incentives because there's also a

1770
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,359
higher demand and etc and they can ask

1771
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,079
more so you actually what you're doing

1772
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,640
is subsidy you're not only giving money

1773
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,680
to consumers you're actually subsidizing

1774
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,079
uh producers and that could be okay but

1775
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,160
you should at least be aware that this

1776
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,160
is what hap what happens if you do these

1777
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,480
kind of incentives and then with other

1778
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,400
things like the kind of like incentives

1779
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,559
to do away with your very old polluting

1780
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,480
car what we've seen in the netherlands

1781
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,799
with uh things like that that happened

1782
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,400
like years ago is that

1783
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,480
that also didn't really work out in

1784
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,480
terms of uh

1785
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,440
overall pollution and landfill and etc

1786
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,240
so it is these are very complex things

1787
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,359
to steer in and usually you'll have psy

1788
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,720
economic

1789
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,319
side effects

1790
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,559
that are not one-to-one related to what

1791
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,359
you're trying to steer so usually other

1792
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,799
measures are

1793
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,760
preferable before you get to that

1794
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,000
um

1795
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,880
um

1796
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,319
also we can stand up and just uh you

1797
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,079
know if you want but

1798
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,240
uh

1799
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,920
i was first actually

1800
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
i would as a matter of combating

1801
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,359
indeference i would please please please

1802
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,400
please drop the bloody lingo of having

1803
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,599
to save the planet or the ecosystem or

1804
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,079
the lovely pandas the pandas

1805
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,839
need porno to reproduce their

1806
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,760
darwinistic failure

1807
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,839
 the pandas

1808
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,160
really

1809
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,760
and the whales and so on it's not it's

1810
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,960
this is not selling well outside your

1811
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,280
own little circles or maybe large

1812
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,119
circles i don't care about the size of

1813
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,480
your circles

1814
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,720
there is a massive circle that you need

1815
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,600
a massive bunch of circles that

1816
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,960
have difficulties making meet ends meets

1817
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,120
at the end of the month where fuel

1818
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,000
poverty will not be able to buy electric

1819
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,799
car until second-hand electric cars will

1820
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,198
become affordable in another decade or

1821
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,238
so

1822
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,399
um none of these people will be

1823
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,399
convinced by a need to save the planet

1824
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,120
if they have difficulties to have both

1825
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,279
to pay their rent and their energy bill

1826
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,679
at the end of the month in february it's

1827
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,839
about us it's about humanity it's about

1828
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,479
our children

1829
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,640
yes i have a comment about luck

1830
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,799
okay very good yes

1831
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,120
um you mentioned before

1832
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,520
that we just don't know

1833
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,359
how to fix it

1834
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,479
how to fix the problems right

1835
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,880
because it's a macro issue that involves

1836
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,520
every possible system in our entire

1837
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,120
biosphere

1838
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,839
and we need to understand that better

1839
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,679
so that we can plan accordingly not just

1840
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,679
to make individual changes to but to

1841
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,158
make changes that will cascade in our

1842
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,520
benefit

1843
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,238
so

1844
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,080
that's how we improve our luck

1845
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,880
we we research we plan

1846
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
multi-pronged attacks when we when we

1847
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,120
see an area that's going to fall

1848
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,759
and it will not support

1849
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,158
civilization living there anymore can we

1850
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,920
turn it into

1851
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,479
a green land that will

1852
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,439
continue to help us even as people move

1853
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,439
whatever it might be yeah

1854
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,080
yeah i agree so i mean we could even

1855
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,520
re-title these as uh care more make

1856
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,600
better decisions and learn

1857
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,199
right

1858
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,239
so um and and the learning is absolutely

1859
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,560
right i mean if if there's one aspect

1860
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,320
that i'm trying to tackle in my work

1861
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,400
it's really uh reducing the catastrophic

1862
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,360
luck

1863
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,480
uh if anything so i i do think i have a

1864
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,719
comment that at least

1865
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,480
maybe slightly long longer term on the

1866
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,560
catastrophic luck side

1867
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,920
um

1868
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,480
so sort of and so i'm certainly not

1869
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,520
going to be defending pandas uh but the

1870
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,280
um

1871
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,840
but the um

1872
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,000
so all technology and all evolution is

1873
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,480
basically path dependent you know if you

1874
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,640
have something you know we can know how

1875
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,640
to do it every species that we

1876
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,560
exterminate we learn

1877
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,800
we're losing we're losing knowledge

1878
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,520
and and this is going to impact what is

1879
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,760
possible for us in the future as a

1880
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,600
species so at some point it is better to

1881
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,800
you know

1882
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,120
if it's a choice between you know i mean

1883
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,199
if it's okay we're going to lose a lot

1884
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,360
of people but if it's a choice between

1885
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,320
you know

1886
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,000
at some point you don't you do want to

1887
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,760
conserve some of these

1888
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,080
a lot of these other species you know

1889
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,480
certainly biomes in the ground and bees

1890
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,199
and like this

1891
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,719
two things

1892
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,679
uh i think we should flip them

1893
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,360
so it's uh what was the indifference one

1894
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,440
was a care more learn

1895
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,880
and then make better decisions yes i

1896
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,360
agreed um and then regarding the pandas

1897
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,040
and all that it actually is just a

1898
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,239
really neat communications and

1899
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,080
behavioral psychology problem that has

1900
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,760
largely been solved um around ownership

1901
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,320
uh of a problem so

1902
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,840
they've done this research with just

1903
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,560
like charities around like children

1904
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,159
when we talk about our children rather

1905
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,320
than those children and their children

1906
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,000
people are more likely to donate money

1907
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,640
it's as seriously as simple as that

1908
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,520
okay

1909
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,560
um

1910
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,600
so i'm i'm a little bit stuck on how we

1911
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,960
progress because i feel like we've

1912
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,600
covered a lot of ground already i know a

1913
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,360
lot of you still have comments and i i

1914
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,320
want to uh try to get them but um what

1915
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,679
i'm thinking is

1916
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:02,800
um

1917
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,360
you know this is a hope session and i

1918
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,239
think

1919
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,239
you know what i set out to kind of try

1920
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,760
to get to is like okay you know the 1.5

1921
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,560
degree

1922
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,080
uh uh

1923
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,960
you know

1924
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,600
temperature raising situation that ship

1925
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
has sailed we might be able to get it

1926
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,920
back but probably not

1927
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,000
there is this catastrophic eight degree

1928
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,960
scenario uh how do we avoid that and you

1929
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,640
know so our cocktail um but

1930
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,760
um

1931
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,080
what i'd like you know

1932
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,880
so let's continue the conversation uh

1933
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,360
not necessarily for much longer you know

1934
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,400
let's maybe give it 20 minutes or so but

1935
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,239
let's try to

1936
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:47,440
uh also like if you've got any good

1937
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,960
examples of projects or or initiatives

1938
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,080
or new laws regulations or anything like

1939
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,480
that that's happening in your local area

1940
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,080
or something like that that you think

1941
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,679
other people should know about this

1942
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,040
would be a great time to hear about it

1943
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,880
because you know i feel like we're

1944
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,239
losing a little bit of momentum we're

1945
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,400
getting a little bit into the weeds and

1946
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,800
i you know i would love to you know have

1947
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,840
like 15 ideas to go and like search for

1948
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,159
on the internet when this is over okay

1949
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,600
so um you had a comment

1950
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,560
uh

1951
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,560
yeah just also on

1952
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,640
catastrophic luck

1953
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,000
i think it mostly also comes down to

1954
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,840
awareness because everyone has their

1955
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,080
equal part to play

1956
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,239
it's about wholeness it's about

1957
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,320
involving everything rethinking every

1958
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
system because it entails all these

1959
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,600
other systems

1960
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,760
all these systems are interdependent and

1961
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,679
uh i think we should

1962
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,000
uh spend a lot of time on awareness and

1963
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,080
education and uh with a particular

1964
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,320
interest in system thinking and systems

1965
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,560
dynamics because

1966
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,000
yeah

1967
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,040
they're all interwoven

1968
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,400
yep very good

1969
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,360
um so actually i work for a paper mill

1970
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,440
in uh in airbag

1971
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,560
um in airbag we have three paper mills

1972
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,280
um since 1661 around that time

1973
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,760
we also have our own

1974
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,800
water affluent plant

1975
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,000
and i i i find it i work already for 15

1976
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,120
years there

1977
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,920
and it's only recently now that the gas

1978
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,120
prices are humongous that we are really

1979
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,560
getting in trouble and pressure is

1980
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,320
really on

1981
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,400
but i find difficult and at the same

1982
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,760
time is maybe uh hopeful in that sense

1983
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,520
i want to refer back to the fab lab i'm

1984
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,480
sorry

1985
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,360
is that what i lack is is connected

1986
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,320
connectedness so we have this factory

1987
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,159
area in earbig

1988
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,040
and uh we are we're on our own almost it

1989
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,239
feels like

1990
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,520
um and and and yeah so holland is on its

1991
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,320
own as well a very small country only 25

1992
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,080
paper mills

1993
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,440
in germany you have over 300 paper mills

1994
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,440
but it seems like everybody is working

1995
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,239
on its own and i find that

1996
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,120
very

1997
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,040
depressing and at the same time i i'm

1998
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,719
from the fab lab community i know it's

1999
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,560
possible to start working together and

2000
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,600
so

2001
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,120
uh

2002
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,640
how can we do that

2003
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,610
that is my question

2004
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,520
[Music]

2005
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,600
so on that um

2006
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,280
there's i think a lot about um

2007
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,199
empowering people with information i

2008
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,800
know that's like a really

2009
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,120
popular thing to say right now but um i

2010
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,400
just want to talk about quickly about a

2011
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,840
project that i know of in south africa

2012
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,280
that is not climate related but i think

2013
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,280
kind of plays into this a little bit and

2014
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,679
it's um townships it turns out that um

2015
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:42,400
in

2016
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,880
cape town they have extremely good plat

2017
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,080
maps like they know where everything is

2018
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,080
which is surprising to some people so

2019
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,520
what these people in townships have done

2020
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,679
is gone hold on a second we have access

2021
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,000
to these plat maps we can understand

2022
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,080
what our towns are supposed to look like

2023
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,520
and they've started to do lots of really

2024
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,360
amazing community building around like

2025
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,280
installing lights and schools and things

2026
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,440
they're making their community safer so

2027
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,199
it's a lot of that kind of like

2028
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,040
information gathering information

2029
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,880
building and learning and then working

2030
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,800
with your community and whether that's

2031
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,480
really local within your town or your

2032
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,120
region or like whatever it is i think

2033
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
there's a way to build on to that so i

2034
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,000
think i think that's part of the answer

2035
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,600
if you're armed with information you can

2036
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,400
build community

2037
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,280
i think that sort of excites me but

2038
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,719
that's on the other end of the scale

2039
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,400
because it's not very local or low scale

2040
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,960
but basically currently every two

2041
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,880
three months there's another

2042
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,719
offshore floating wind concept being

2043
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,320
pushed out by the kind of industrial

2044
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,719
firms that can make that happen

2045
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,600
so i fully expect us to do that europe

2046
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,320
may be able to be ahead of the curve on

2047
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,640
electricity generation just based on

2048
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,239
offshore wind

2049
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,760
uh as in

2050
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,320
uh and but what's interesting is this is

2051
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,159
stuff that is

2052
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,600
specifically designed to become

2053
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,360
mass-produced

2054
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,560
um

2055
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,640
specifically to be designed to be

2056
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,320
relatively low-cost maintenance because

2057
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,679
offshore wind is more expensive than

2058
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,120
onshore wind because you have to

2059
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
helicopter in

2060
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,600
maintenance technicians

2061
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,000
or bring in expensive ships to make them

2062
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,880
et cetera this is all designed to be

2063
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,920
built in harbors

2064
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
brought into the ocean by tuck boats and

2065
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,239
then connected to local grades for

2066
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,560
hydrogen exercises this is all

2067
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,360
not there yet but this is something that

2068
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,600
is pretty viable to happen within the

2069
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,520
next decade

2070
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,000
and i'll shut up a little

2071
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,560
actually one thing uh just came to mind

2072
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,679
about uh you know the optimistic side um

2073
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:48,960
so

2074
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,520
there's at events like this we

2075
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,159
we have a slight tendency to be very

2076
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,799
shall we say

2077
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,960
suspicious of uh like capitalistic

2078
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,199
tendencies and like you know that kind

2079
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,800
of thing but

2080
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,120
it er it's interesting that like now

2081
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,880
we're in the middle of this like massive

2082
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,520
economic downturn uh pretty much hitting

2083
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,920
every country in the world pretty much

2084
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,920
like we're seeing double-digit inflation

2085
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,320
it's like everything's pretty bad

2086
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,400
one of the things that was happening

2087
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,960
back in like uh october november

2088
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,560
december is that

2089
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,960
basically like every single week there

2090
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,000
was a new uh venture capital fund

2091
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,960
established to fund climate tech

2092
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,520
research or climate uh uh climate

2093
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,840
technology of some kind or other

2094
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,719
um there's so much money sloshing about

2095
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,800
in the system for developing

2096
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,040
technologies to help with climate change

2097
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,520
that like it's it's kind of almost

2098
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,120
obnoxious at the moment

2099
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,320
um

2100
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,920
and one of the things that's really

2101
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,280
positive is

2102
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,280
now we're in this economic downturn and

2103
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,400
none of those funds has gone away

2104
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,239
um the investment rate might have slowed

2105
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,600
down a little bit

2106
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,760
but the the same amount of

2107
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,640
money is still available and so when i'm

2108
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,120
like thinking about the the overall big

2109
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,840
picture of like how we're gonna tackle

2110
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
this there's definitely a tendency to go

2111
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,679
like oh yeah we're gonna need a

2112
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,400
revolution and we're gonna need to

2113
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,360
re-structure everything and like uh but

2114
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,600
like humanity's been through a few hard

2115
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,239
places in the past one or two maybe

2116
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,120
and uh like yeah sometimes we have

2117
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,040
fundamentally restructured our system

2118
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,159
but often we've like just used systems

2119
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,000
that we already have in efficient ways

2120
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,719
and i think like uh when when it comes

2121
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,199
to the technologies that are emerging

2122
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,000
you know

2123
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,560
we have uh more and more carbon capture

2124
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,560
plants i actually don't really believe

2125
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,719
much in the idea of like

2126
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,239
like you know if you are trying to

2127
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,080
caption capture carbon from the

2128
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,480
atmosphere uh you need to

2129
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,520
um you're capturing about 300 grams per

2130
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,280
tonne of processed air i don't think

2131
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,320
that's very like you know

2132
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,600
scalable but hey you know like uh people

2133
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,840
are doing all sorts of cool stuff some

2134
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,920
of the projects are absolute

2135
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,639
but like there are such good projects in

2136
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,960
between that actually we're we're seeing

2137
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,880
progress uh the other thing is i

2138
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,520
mentioned earlier the um the great green

2139
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,120
wall project have all of you heard of

2140
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,639
that

2141
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,320
it's um so for a few who didn't seem to

2142
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,639
be nodding uh it's this idea that

2143
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,480
they're gonna

2144
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,600
like build like uh so grow a world

2145
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,280
wonder a a green belt right across the

2146
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,760
southern end of the sahara

2147
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,520
uh specifically to try and slow down the

2148
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,840
expansion of the sahara desert

2149
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,600
now

2150
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,800
deserts are problematic uh in some ways

2151
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,239
some of them are natural there's a

2152
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,800
natural desert i found out a few days

2153
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,000
ago in poland uh it's not very big but

2154
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,120
like there's a desert in poland

2155
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,520
yeah but um and sahara is um at least

2156
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,800
for our purposes nowadays uh natural and

2157
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,280
the amount of material from the sahara

2158
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,120
that feeds into the amazon is like huge

2159
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,040
and super important so we don't

2160
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,920
necessarily want to eliminate the sahara

2161
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,159
but managing to combat the certification

2162
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,960
on that scale is kind of mind-blowing uh

2163
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,440
so you know every effort that

2164
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,000
supports things like that i think will

2165
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,639
will make a huge impact so like yeah i

2166
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,320
just wanted to mention a few positive

2167
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,000
projects um

2168
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,679
anybody else got one

2169
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,199
yeah i think there's a bunch of uh

2170
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,040
agrovoltaics look really promising there

2171
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,880
seems to be a lot of investment in that

2172
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,639
because people in southern europe seem

2173
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,080
to be figuring out that they need to

2174
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,679
manage the humidity of their crops and

2175
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,679
it's useful for that yeah

2176
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,520
my i have a side quest at the moment

2177
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,480
that is around aggro photovoltaics

2178
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,880
and specifically in the context of

2179
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,719
developing countries so one of the

2180
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,679
things that happens uh for those not

2181
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,000
super into power grids um is

2182
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,679
uh so

2183
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,520
if you have countries with very

2184
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,239
underdeveloped power grids the the few

2185
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,840
locations where there is a power grid

2186
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,560
are typically close to the cities and

2187
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,560
the land are immediately around the city

2188
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,760
is where you're going to have the most

2189
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,480
contention or most com competition for

2190
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,120
for land because that's the best way to

2191
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,920
import food into the city and so what

2192
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,760
you want to do is you need more

2193
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,800
electricity but you can't take that land

2194
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,360
away from the agricultural use so by

2195
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,600
mixing those together uh building

2196
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,000
photovoltaics that are raised about four

2197
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,480
four to six meters above the agriculture

2198
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,840
land so you can still do farming

2199
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,679
underneath um

2200
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,600
it reduces the heat stress on the plants

2201
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,120
it reduces the evaporation of water

2202
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,960
while you know and makes it possible to

2203
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,920
grow things that um you

2204
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,400
might not be able to grow in a like much

2205
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,159
warmer environment

2206
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:00,960
but

2207
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,040
you know it's not perfect and we don't

2208
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,320
have good

2209
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,120
out-of-the-box models for it yet so

2210
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,280
but yeah it's it's super cool thanks for

2211
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,639
mentioning it

2212
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,800
huh

2213
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,239
yeah

2214
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,920
yeah

2215
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,800
all right

2216
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,440
um i'm super excited about meat

2217
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
replacements and general

2218
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,679
vegetarian-based

2219
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,199
options

2220
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,719
one of the founders of the vegetarian

2221
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,120
butcher dutch company now started the

2222
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,560
vegan cowboys

2223
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,800
and the company tries to create a yeast

2224
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,639
which can create milk directly from

2225
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,280
grass so you just cut out the whole cow

2226
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,560
in between oh that's amazing yeah

2227
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,719
that's super awesome

2228
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,040
compina the dutch dutch milk company

2229
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,800
said oh we're not afraid but i think

2230
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,400
they're afraid and

2231
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,639
i hope they're afraid because

2232
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,719
i i love cows

2233
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,360
i hope they can stay on this planet even

2234
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,400
after the dairy industry but they're not

2235
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,840
as efficient in creating

2236
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,880
milk horses are still around

2237
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,880
not as mining as in the 19th century but

2238
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,600
there's actually

2239
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,880
[Music]

2240
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,440
oh yep

2241
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,639
there's a canadian startup called

2242
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:20,320
carbocrete that sounds interesting

2243
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,800
they are working with the steel industry

2244
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,320
in canada and capturing their waste co2

2245
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,480
and shoving it into concrete instead of

2246
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,239
sand

2247
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,960
it is producing

2248
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,000
net

2249
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,239
uh negative carbon concrete

2250
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,159
okay

2251
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,679
though

2252
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,000
yeah uh i actually so steel mills are a

2253
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,760
pet peeve of mine because they produce

2254
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,960
about seven percent of all all co2 uh

2255
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,080
that's released and nobody ever

2256
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,600
complains about them you know because

2257
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,360
nobody sees steel mills they're just

2258
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,080
like they they're just there but uh yeah

2259
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,080
no that's that's super cool the all the

2260
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,239
big steel producers are looking into

2261
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,520
hydrogen based steel production for

2262
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,280
because steel production ultimately you

2263
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,600
see redux reaction you have to want to

2264
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,800
pull out the

2265
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,719
oxygen that is inside

2266
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,080
iron oxide and currently use syngas for

2267
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,679
that which you

2268
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,840
produce based on with coal but you can

2269
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,000
do it with hydrogen

2270
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,400
there is a viable way forward to

2271
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,840
close to net zero still in the

2272
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,040
close future yeah well on that note uh

2273
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,920
the aluminum industry uh so the way

2274
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,040
aluminum is uh so you take bauxite from

2275
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,199
the ground you process it it's actually

2276
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,520
a very horrible process that needs to be

2277
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,480
fixed with that it's uh lots of lye lots

2278
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,600
of like bad bases but when you get the

2279
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,199
aluminum diox

2280
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,000
or aluminum oxide uh

2281
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,560
powder essentially it needs to be you

2282
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,120
need to remove the oxygen from it and

2283
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,719
the way they do that is through

2284
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,320
electrolysis and uh so what has been

2285
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,480
done for pretty much you know the since

2286
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,199
the whole hero process was

2287
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:10,159
created is they use these uh giant um

2288
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,239
carbon based um

2289
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:16,960
uh electro so electrodes uh and uh the

2290
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,320
oxygen is being pulled to the carbon

2291
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,560
and then that releases the co2

2292
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,000
so it's a very co2 rich uh um

2293
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,239
uh and you know bad process so now uh

2294
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,600
some people

2295
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,360
in iceland incidentally

2296
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,360
have developed a

2297
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,000
a new type of electrode for

2298
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,120
aluminum smelting that is carbon neutral

2299
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,840
so i don't know if they've gotten into

2300
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
production yet but the testing's

2301
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,840
basically done so that's positive

2302
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,600
i think there are so many cool projects

2303
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,199
at the moment

2304
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,000
and

2305
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,639
two or three months ago i uh

2306
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,280
i saw that you can be a volunteer an ng

2307
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,360
coach

2308
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,960
within your uh

2309
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,840
city

2310
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,760
so what you do you you get a

2311
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,320
uh they they teach you first what you

2312
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,480
should do as a as a coach and then you

2313
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,920
go to people

2314
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,719
and then educate them like

2315
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,639
let's say uh turn out off the lights if

2316
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,360
you go uh go away

2317
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,880
uh but they also

2318
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,040
help you to find

2319
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,360
which areas in your house are

2320
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,719
uh

2321
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,880
coming through so

2322
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,600
i think that's it's not really cool but

2323
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,920
this will help so you go to people you

2324
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,679
make them aware and they they start

2325
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,360
thinking about okay

2326
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,960
if i

2327
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,760
if i be if i you smart

2328
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,320
small uh

2329
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,239
initiatives or

2330
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,440
steps that can save me money

2331
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,000
and maybe it will turn out that they

2332
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,560
to become

2333
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,120
i say

2334
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,000
they also provide us ideas back about

2335
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,040
about sustainability

2336
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,520
yeah cool

2337
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,960
so i think we're maybe done

2338
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,400
are we

2339
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,120
that's amazing there's a you know i mean

2340
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,639
okay it's been uh we

2341
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,639
we've it's been a rough session we've uh

2342
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,639
we've had to go through a lot of stuff

2343
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:21,520
right

2344
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,080
but we came into this with okay what are

2345
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,000
the conditions needed for everything to

2346
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,480
be be absolutely terrible and now we're

2347
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,239
kind of at a point where like we know

2348
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,679
what to do

2349
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,760
we we need to care more we need to learn

2350
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,920
more we need to have better make better

2351
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,520
decisions this is fantastic right

2352
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,600
we've heard about some cool projects

2353
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,199
we know that there are many more cool

2354
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,560
projects out there

2355
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,320
and i think you know if we go through

2356
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,480
the points here we want to improve the

2357
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,159
incentives but you know we need to have

2358
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,159
these conversations we need to

2359
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,639
experience connectedness and you know

2360
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,639
and train each other you know to your

2361
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,520
last point uh we need to like

2362
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,400
understand the life cycles of our things

2363
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,960
we need to improve learning and research

2364
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,159
and

2365
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,239
awareness around that introduce more

2366
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:10,480
systems thinking into the entire process

2367
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,040
thinking longer term uh as much as

2368
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,880
possible and then

2369
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,520
on the policy side or making decisions

2370
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,360
internalize the externalities i think we

2371
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,920
came back to that point about 15 times

2372
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,000
and like you know if we'd come back to

2373
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:24,639
it

2374
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,960
1500 more times it wouldn't have been

2375
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,239
less true so um you know we do have some

2376
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,800
some weeds here you know beat industry

2377
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,880
the aviation industry is not perfect

2378
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,360
shipping you know la la

2379
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,719
definitely need to fix some other

2380
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,040
cultures but we still like being able to

2381
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,920
get avocados in the polar regions right

2382
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,840
um you know but

2383
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,080
i love this one protect the poor like

2384
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,040
you know

2385
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,960
being being a little bit humane about

2386
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,120
the fact that there's a lot of countries

2387
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,520
where uh people are still struggling

2388
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,199
with the basic necessities of life and

2389
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,440
just being you know making sure that

2390
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,560
they don't get over by us being

2391
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,480
trying to save the planet because we

2392
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,000
save the planet but them over in

2393
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,520
the process then you know they might be

2394
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,520
incentivized to us over next time

2395
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,520
and you know it'll be it'll be nasty so

2396
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,920
let's protect everybody uh reform land

2397
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,320
and stop planned obs lessons and 15

2398
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,679
million other things that we might be

2399
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,520
able to do to improve our lives but you

2400
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,360
know what i'm pretty hopeful we're not

2401
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,000
it's not perfect it's going to be hard

2402
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,320
but we'll win okay

2403
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,400
you want a final point

2404
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,159
okay

2405
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,760
you briefly said you're a recovering

2406
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,510
anarchist

2407
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,679
[Laughter]

2408
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,280
can you talk to take

2409
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,159
this over

2410
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,800
oh okay can you can you talk about it

2411
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,880
okay uh so i normally don't

2412
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,080
manifest in public because it uh it

2413
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,280
confuses people a lot um the but

2414
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,880
generally if

2415
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,520
if i must label myself with some kind of

2416
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,560
uh political label i would say uh

2417
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,239
mutualist so

2418
01:30:58,239 --> 01:30:59,679
um like

2419
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,000
i believe in free markets and networks

2420
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,800
of exchange and and that kind of thing

2421
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,000
um you know but i also wanted to be

2422
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,239
voluntary and non-coercive and

2423
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:11,280
on a

2424
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,800
individual communal basis so you know

2425
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,440
and i actually so the book that um that

2426
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,960
ella was uh

2427
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,840
talking about yesterday um

2428
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,280
the dawn of everything

2429
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,080
um i think that the ideas that are

2430
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,600
presented in there about like a

2431
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
non-coercive society

2432
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,679
they fit very nicely with

2433
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,360
that kind of

2434
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,760
like mutualist political economy and and

2435
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,400
things like that but yeah this is off

2436
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,159
topic so maybe we can talk about it over

2437
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:41,600
a year later

2438
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,560
but does that answer your question

2439
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,679
okay okay uh yeah but i mean regardless

2440
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:49,280
of what our politics are or where we

2441
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,679
come from i you know

2442
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,440
does everybody roughly agree that we've

2443
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,880
made some progress in the direction of

2444
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,960
being hopeful

2445
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,760
okay perfect and my job here is done

2446
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,650
thank you very much see you at the bar

2447
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:06,860
