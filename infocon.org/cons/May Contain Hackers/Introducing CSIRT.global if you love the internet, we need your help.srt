[Music]

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,279
then next up is introducing csert.global

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,800
if you love the internet we need your

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
help so the internet is in a downward

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,880
spiral and there's a community to help

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,760
that

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,439
and with me on stage is edward ryuz who

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
is the global chairman of c-3 and he

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
will now take the stage please give him

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
a round of applause

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,030
[Applause]

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
thank you very much

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
on this wonderful evening

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
i will make it quick tonight so thank

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
you very much for being here i want to

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
introduce you to csert.global

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,879
it is a new foundation and we want to

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,960
explain what we're doing why we're doing

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
it why we believe that this is an

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
important job and that we want to ask

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
you for help as well

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
so first let me introduce myself nicely

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and i have been

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,360
on computer since 1985.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
i was quite young back then so i only

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,159
see

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
64 back then my first pc in 1991

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
i fried my first main board shortly

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,680
after that and started working it in

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,159
1996. now this all is a tremendously

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,680
long time ago

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
but what this means for me is that i was

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
here in computer science and computer

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,159
security

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
since before the internet came about

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
and i love the internet you know the

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
reason why i'm here i believe is also

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
that i love the internet very very much

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
so from the 90s i worked for various

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,040
companies

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,000
and

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,960
i started actually doing volunteer work

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
at divd

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
in 2021

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
shortly after victor haefers one of the

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
founders of the ivd rss

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,600
asked me to start csr.global which is in

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
essence an organization

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
wanting to do the same things as the avd

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
does but then internationally tremendous

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,599
honor for me

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
how could i say no i didn't and i'm i'm

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
here today

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
what i want to talk to you about today

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,680
very simple story really is as much as i

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
love the internet the internet has a lot

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
of problems i think the internet is in

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
dire straits

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
a group of volunteers

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
many of them are here today

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,840
at the front row

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,160
hello and are trying to do something

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
about this and they are tremendously

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
successful and very proud and honored to

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,160
be working with them

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
um but there is a problem because many

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,599
times they not only do research and find

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
vulnerabilities

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
they even scan the entire internet and

70
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
find where those problems actually are

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
but is that enough that is often not

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,519
enough sadly

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,640
and this is where

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
csr.global comes in

75
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
we try to take those findings and take

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
them across the home straight

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
because only knowing where it is and

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
what the problem is is not enough you

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
need to find an owner for a problem

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
who's willing to solve it

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
because if you don't the problem is

82
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,599
still there

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,080
and that requires a lot of work and

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
that's what we we're here for

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,239
let me first start with what i believe

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
are the biggest problems on the internet

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,920
i believe we have ttl problems

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
and it's not the ttl you might know

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,599
it is different kind of ttl

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,319
the first t stands for tech

91
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
the internet

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,879
is created by nice old wonderful

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,400
scientists confused all scientists maybe

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
who built this solely on trust

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
and that is fantastic

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,439
but once there are people on that same

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,760
network that we don't trust

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,599
there's no technology to actively

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,920
counter that the internet

100
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,599
has been suffering

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
from that building on trust and that old

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
school technology ever

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,358
into the 2020s now we all know

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
the symptoms of this we know we all know

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,199
we run ipv4 when ipv6 is already

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
decades available

107
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
and hypothetically way more secure at

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
least much more difficult to scan

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
but we don't use it

110
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
and a lot of software that we use on the

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
internet is built by for-profit

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
organizations with managers and

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
deadlines

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
time crunches software supply chains are

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,479
a mess

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
even if you know what kind of software

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
you use you don't know what's in it etc

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
etc and this means

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
that for example at the end of june

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,840
when i checked the cve database there

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,560
were 22

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,160
292 of them in there

123
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,840
and

124
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,479
147 of them had a score of 9 or higher

125
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
which means we need to do something

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
essentially right now

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
so add this to the facts

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
that scanning the internet takes

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
motivated individual

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
about three hours nowadays

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
you know it's the internet is not that

132
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
big if you consider

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
and whenever something happens like

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
exchange vulnerabilities or whatever

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
more than a hundred individual groups

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
start scanning

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,280
and are in a red race both the good guys

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
and the bad guys

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
trying to out scan each other in order

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
to find the problems the bad buyers guys

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
want to misuse them the good guys

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
want to disclose them

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,120
so the internet has technology problems

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
the second problem i believe is there on

145
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,919
the internet is trust

146
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,240
there is either too much

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
or too little trust

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
but there are seldom the right amount of

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,919
trust

150
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,080
at the right time

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
and this is a problem too at least this

152
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,919
is a problem for us

153
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
so look at these three little

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
photographs i'm showing you here we have

155
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
google

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
we have solar cells

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,280
and we have a hacker defacing my website

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,840
back in

159
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,319
2007. who of these three you reckon

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
wanted to help me

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
and you're right

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,479
it's not the first two ones

163
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,120
the first two ones we know now

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
right there's a lot of trust by the

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
general public in all kinds

166
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
of technology big tech we all trust

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,479
google

168
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
we point our dns servers to 8888

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
we trust our solar suppliers and we

170
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
trust their app

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
as divd is just close

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,280
not always a

173
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
smart thing to do but how what what else

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,960
can you do

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
and as a matter of fact this third

176
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
gentleman that defaced my website back

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
in 2007

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
he left a little message where

179
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,560
he could be reached on jabber

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
so i did i contacted him

181
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
and it was a brazilian gentleman and he

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
told me what was going on he told me

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
that i had a vulnerability in my open

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
ssl implementation in my apache web

185
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,360
server

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
so it's sometimes not always obvious who

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
you trust or who you can trust

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
i understand that very well

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
but one thing that's absolutely true

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,319
they're seldom the right kind of trust

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
at the right time

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in the right process

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
so trust is a big problem

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
and then the third ttl problem the l is

195
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
law

196
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
lawmakers

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
don't help us a lot

198
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
they are lagging by at least 10 years

199
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
and they're pretending like the internet

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
which is this big big

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
giant global community

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,919
is not

203
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,240
it's very difficult to geofence the

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
internet

205
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
but they still try to

206
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,039
and they're running their laws and

207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,319
they're building their laws and they're

208
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
building their alliances

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
based on borders

210
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
and this is seldomly aligns well to

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
something as fluid and transparent as

212
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
the internet

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,720
big tech have now more power and

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
leverage than governments

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,599
and you can say well you know

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
why should i care well they are not they

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,719
don't have a seat in the united nations

218
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,839
maybe they should have but they don't

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
they make their decisions without a lot

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
of check and balance and these decisions

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,880
impact us

222
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
and coordinated vulnerability

223
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
disclosures there's so many of them it's

224
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
treated super different across all of

225
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
the globe

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,360
so

227
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
i pulled the news item from from the

228
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,160
internet this says the department of

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
justice

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,320
will no longer prosecute ethical hackers

231
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
who try to test security

232
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,519
what do you reckon is the date of this

233
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
new item

234
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
what do you think this is a u.s news

235
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,240
item

236
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,399
how old is it

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
five years ten years

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,720
how about

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
five weeks

240
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
only five weeks ago they proposed a law

241
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
where ethical hackers

242
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,040
could not be prosecuted

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
and this is how vastly different

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
ethical hacking and coordinated

245
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,519
vulnerability disclosure is treated all

246
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
over the world

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
and that means

248
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
if we want to scale this process

249
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
globally

250
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
we need to deal with different kinds of

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
laws and jurisdictions

252
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
and that means that someone is going to

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
need to do a heck of a lot of boring

254
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
work

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
but by golly

256
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
we need to do it

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
otherwise this global process will not

258
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
kick off

259
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
in essence no one is responsible many

260
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
organizations take

261
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
part of the responsibility

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
but no one is responsible there is no

263
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,720
one responsible for the internet

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,839
so

265
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,399
the only thing you can do is taking a

266
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
little bit of responsibility in areas

267
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
where you believe you can take a

268
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,399
difference

269
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,480
and in 2019

270
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,640
a group of dutch volunteers probably

271
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
don't need to know and tell you who they

272
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
are but they're the dutch institute of

273
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
volume vulnerability disclosure led by

274
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
victor haefers a wonderful other people

275
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
osgrid osborough

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
chris von trov and many others they do

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
fantastic work i'm very proud to

278
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
volunteer with them today

279
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
they do fantastic research their two

280
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
outstanding processes

281
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,399
i would say is research their capability

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,279
to find and feel what is making a

283
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,000
difference in technology today and dive

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
into it

285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
like

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,720
the solar panels this is super super

287
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
relevant because in large parts of the

288
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,920
world

289
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,959
there is

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,000
a war going on which is impacting energy

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
consumption globally everyone wants to

292
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
dive into solar cells

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
but now we know that this isn't always

294
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
without risk for the end user

295
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
cassaya is another prime example of

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
where they felt something wasn't quite

297
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
right

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
they thought maybe those msps some of

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
them very small were using this software

300
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,399
to manage their many customers

301
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
gaining direct access to their customers

302
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,839
premises and doing all kinds of

303
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,680
administrative tasks

304
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
now of course when they found it was

305
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,120
very much

306
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
broken and there were a lot of leaks in

307
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,760
there

308
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
this was a huge huge thing

309
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
so they do fantastic research and

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
they're going to keep doing that

311
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
and globe caesar global's going to

312
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,079
benefit from that as well but the second

313
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
thing that they do very very well

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
they are one of those more than 100

315
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
organizations that scan the internet

316
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
within three hours after something is

317
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
happening

318
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
they not only scan but also the results

319
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
then get aggregated and run through an

320
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
inform process

321
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,760
so what they do essentially send abused

322
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
emails

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,800
and it is wonderful that they're doing

324
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
that they don't need to do that but they

325
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
do

326
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
because they're just wonderful people

327
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,519
they want to take responsibility

328
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
and they do it very very well

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
but informing can be very frustrating

330
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
which is why i created a little graph

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
for you

332
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
and this graph shows you the measured

333
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
response on for example i think with

334
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,639
exchange we sent something like 40 000

335
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,120
emails to abuse email addresses or

336
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
addresses we got out of the security.txt

337
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
and this is the measured response

338
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
about 1 in 200 emails

339
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
got a response saying oh wonderful thank

340
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
you so much

341
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,800
we love your work keep keep it going

342
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
another one in 200 said

343
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,279
go away you're trying to sell me

344
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
something or

345
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
i'll call my lawyer if you don't stop

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
hacking me

347
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
the other 99 percent silence

348
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
or bouncers

349
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,320
but that's how hard it is if you want to

350
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
automate

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
your warnings

352
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,880
which are fair and coming from a good

353
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,680
heart people should heed the warnings at

354
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
the same time they don't

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
so informing can be frustrating

356
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
and this is why we need to be global

357
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
because if people don't respond and they

358
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
don't act

359
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,399
on what we can

360
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
tell them the problem is still there the

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
internet's still vulnerable

362
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
speed is security and in order to be

363
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
more speedy we need to build two global

364
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,000
things the first is trust and the second

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
is an understanding of law

366
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
and acting

367
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
according to local ethics

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,760
and trust we believe we can build

369
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,120
with our chapter structure it's there to

370
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
respect and understand

371
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
and adapt to local culture

372
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,519
and we aim to build chapters wherever

373
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
they are needed

374
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,399
and allow for people to work

375
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
under the same principles the same code

376
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
of conduct

377
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
and the same values

378
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
as divd

379
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
but do it internationally within a

380
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
certain geographical

381
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
area

382
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
but we also need sector access because

383
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
every now and then taking a

384
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
vertical slice from a cake will yield

385
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
you way more surface instead of a

386
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
horizontal slice

387
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,839
so building bridges to sectors that need

388
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,279
us most

389
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,360
and finally we need to build relations

390
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
with people that can endorse us

391
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
we should not underestimate for example

392
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
how important it is

393
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
especially in the beginning when you got

394
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
a scanning email from divd

395
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
and people were asking

396
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
were these guys sending me all these

397
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
emails about hacking and all that kind

398
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,279
of stuff

399
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,440
when the government could tell them no

400
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
you can trust these people you know we

401
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,399
have absolutely

402
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
we have nothing to do with them but we

403
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
know them and you can trust them

404
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,480
so these endorsements and building this

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
trust and having someone who will vouch

406
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
for us

407
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
we need to find them as well

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
and in that way we can start filling in

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
the little

410
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
areas in the globe

411
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
so in readying for the future the divide

412
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
board

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
had a very uh forward-thinking plan and

414
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,279
they split up the initial foundation

415
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
into several foundations i think i'm

416
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
missing even two

417
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
i think i'm missing a club and i'm

418
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
missing um maybe another one but these

419
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
are essentially the or the new

420
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,959
foundations that are going to do it divd

421
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
will still be there

422
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
for the research and the scanning inform

423
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,279
process and csr.global

424
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,759
will be the organization responsible to

425
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
take it internationally

426
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
and then we have of course wonderful new

427
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,320
additions like the dvd academy and the

428
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
fund from where we can fund wonderful

429
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
new forward thinking projects

430
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,040
and within

431
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
are season.global so this is our

432
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
responsibility this is how building this

433
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,279
network works

434
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
so imagine there is a severe

435
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
vulnerability let's just say um it's

436
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
already out there it has a cv number

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,959
it's in the press whatever so

438
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,519
um first thing we do is we find if it's

439
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,160
scannable if it's scannable we do quick

440
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
research we create scripts and we start

441
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,360
scanning the entire ipv4 space that's

442
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,759
done pretty fast because there's only

443
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,359
4.29

444
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,559
billion

445
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,039
ip addresses which is not a lot really

446
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
not with our infrastructure

447
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
and then we try to map the results where

448
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
we get positive ones to automated emails

449
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
these emails then as we can see in the

450
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
graph are ignored

451
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,919
right and this is where caesar global

452
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
comes in we take the extra effort

453
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
we geographically

454
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,799
we send it to our chapter structure to

455
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,799
start spreading it locally

456
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,919
in individual geographical regions

457
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
and we take it through our partnerships

458
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
into different sectors for example

459
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,600
um could be we have been making friends

460
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
with the msp space

461
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
we have been making friends with the ngo

462
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
space

463
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,400
um and these affected parties then may

464
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
even call their search

465
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
their local source saying hey who are

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,679
these guys and they will then tell them

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
how you can trust cesaro global these

468
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
are good people you can trust their work

469
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
then more vulnerabilities are mitigated

470
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
and faster as well

471
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,200
this is the essentially the design

472
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,559
that we want to do

473
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
and it will make sure

474
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
that the giant

475
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,559
giant checkerboard that we're trying to

476
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,799
fill is the world relevant to ipv4 space

477
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,960
with chapters

478
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
and with sectors

479
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,039
and we won't rest

480
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
until we cover

481
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
the entire

482
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
checkerboard that is the world

483
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
which is 200 countries

484
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,480
and lord knows how many sectors

485
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,799
but building a global trusted cser

486
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,559
network is hard

487
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,880
we have been working quite hard at it

488
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
we're actually very proud we have

489
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
started our first

490
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,239
chapter in the uk

491
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,360
but we need of course help

492
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
this is where you come in

493
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
you get something as well

494
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
because i can tell you from experience

495
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
the experience of working with the

496
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
talented and passionate people is

497
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,919
something that will that will be very

498
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,360
very good for your soul and i can

499
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
recommend it to anyone but you will also

500
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
meet international new friends

501
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
and you will get support

502
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
and they will definitely help you be a

503
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
better person

504
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
and a better professional

505
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
this is the promise that caesar global

506
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
will make you

507
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
but what we ask is people who believe in

508
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,240
making the world a better place

509
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
willingness to invest time to fill that

510
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
darn matrix with us

511
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,760
and

512
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
we need people to agree with our core

513
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,880
values and code of conduct

514
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
that's very important but essentially we

515
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
need to conquer the world we need to do

516
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,799
it side by side

517
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
and we can't have differences about how

518
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
we do it

519
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
so

520
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
if this sparks your interest

521
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
there's many people you can get in touch

522
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,000

570
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
you just check rar databases for the

571
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
abuse contact for the ip address space

572
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,430
like aaron apnic ripe

573
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,600
[Music]

574
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,780
thanks leonardo you can have my micro

582
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,520
[Applause]

583
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
so in contacting people we use various

584
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,120
ways to track down contact information

585
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,240
abusing information for ip block is one

586
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
but preferably a last resort if you have

587
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
a domain name

588
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
from certificate or something we can of

589
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
course mail info ads

590
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
security ad etc at the domain if they

591
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
have a website we can scrape it for

592
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,000
security.text or some kind of privacy

593
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,159
contact and those are the various ways

594
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,799
we try to get in contact great thanks

595
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,799
another question is regarding threat

596
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,840
intel like how do you prioritize like

597
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,960
the cves if for example in nation states

598
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
is after one cv do you go after that or

599
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,400
is there any kind of protection

600
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,000
yeah yeah so um so we look generally at

601
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,480
risk at the highest amount of risk to

602
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,200
the largest group of people

603
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
we try also to be as apolitical as we

604
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
can in our decision making

605
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
so that's typically where we look at

606
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,679
so

607
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
it is a little bit of a an art if you

608
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
will

609
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
um it's super difficult if you look at

610
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
cves you know the first two pages all of

611
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
them have score 10

612
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
right so so where do you start

613
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,480
and and and this is really where the art

614
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,039
comes in sometimes there's a lot of work

615
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,360
being done already by vendors you know

616
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
they're on top of it they really you

617
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
know they they know what they're doing

618
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
you know even though it's super bad you

619
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
know let them have edits and sometimes

620
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
it's something that we think well we

621
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,279
think we think people are

622
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
really underestimating this one so we'll

623
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
invest in effort there it is an art yeah

624
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
thank you

625
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,000
are there any more questions

626
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
if that is not the case then i would

627
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,480
like to thank you for your talk and your

628
