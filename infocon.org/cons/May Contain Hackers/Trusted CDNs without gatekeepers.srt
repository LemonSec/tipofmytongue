2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
hello everyone as you can clearly see on

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,880
the screen

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,520
um the title of the talk is trusted cdns

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
without gatekeepers so i'll be talking

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
about web3 blockchain no i'm not no

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
there's not going to be any any mention

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,160
of blockchain

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,279
um

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,519
so uh trusted cdns without the

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,399
gatekeepers uh who am i uh my name is

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
mihao rishikovojniak

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
um

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,840
over the years i've i've been on all the

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
different sides of of tech and internet

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,760
i've been an activist i've been on the

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,480
policy side somewhat i've been

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
i handled tech support and information

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,199
security for uh journalists and others

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
at risk individuals

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
and i managed infrastructure and now i'm

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
doubling a little bit in in journalism

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
in tech journalism myself

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,120
but for the for the specific um

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
uh for this specific talk what is what

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
is probably most important is that i

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
i've been a uh

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
chief information security officer and

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
head of infrastructure at occrp anybody

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
remembers occrp

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
um the panama papers says more yeah

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
there we go that's yeah yeah so

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
not surprisingly websites hosted by

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
occrp tended to have very little traffic

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
and then suddenly very very very much

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,079
traffic

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
uh so that was an interesting uh

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
interesting thing that got me thinking

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
about um how how can we make websites

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
resilient how can we make websites you

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,520
know stay up and running

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
without relying on things like you know

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
cloudflare uh because cloudflare um

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
so um

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
i've given a talk two years ago at hope

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
2020 called censorship is no longer

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
interpreted as damage and what i said in

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
this talk uh are you looking at the

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
screens is it is it visible okay so

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
because there's going to be information

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,920
on the on the slides but i will be also

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,560
trying to say it all out loud so in that

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
talk i covered

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
the first part let's let's say of of

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
making websites resilient and

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
or my

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
my idea of making websites resilient and

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
that was a

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
focused on sane website setup uh right

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
don't have a wordpress with 50 plugins

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
because that will make you cry and this

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
will make your server cry and this will

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
make your visitors cry

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
caching and micro caching static site

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
generators

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
and coping with downtime when when that

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
happens so i would implore you to watch

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
that talk at some point but it's not

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
necessary to

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
have what have watched that talk to to

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,480
be able to uh

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,440
follow this talk uh but it's it it might

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,920
be useful uh on its um

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,319
on its own some of the things i will

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
repeat a little bit uh from that talk

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
here because they are relevant so

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
anybody here runs a website that every

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
now and then gets a bit of traffic that

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
makes the server go like

80
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,959
[Music]

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,840
okay

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,720
so uh my takeaway from from doing this

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
and and and having dealt with downtime

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
and all of that is that whatever it is

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,560
it is almost certainly not a ddos you

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
are almost certainly not dealing with

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
the ddos your website is down not

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
because of a ddos it is almost certainly

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,680
down because it's probably just organic

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
traffic that is hitting your uh your

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
dynamic cms

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
is the term dynamic cms

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,120
understandable i assume it is right so

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
it's things like wordpress right

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,599
data is in the in the database somewhere

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
then there's a bunch of code and for

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,000
every request roughly uh you get the

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
data gets pulled from the database you

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
know html gets rendered pushed to the

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
user right that's a lot of work

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,440
um

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
and and this means that there's uh you

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
would be amazed how few uh requests per

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,760
second the standard wordpress site can

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
handle right unless you you're doing

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
some fancy stuff like micro caching but

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
then of course there are the plugins uh

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,000
for cmss and i'm focusing on wordpress

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
because it's the most popular one and

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
and also it gave me the most grief

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
uh but things like over 90 90 wordpress

112
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
themes plugins backdoored in supply

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
chain attack right

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
uh yes that's that's what happens

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,160
because you have a plugin that somebody

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
wrote five years ago and then stopped

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
you know updating

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
uh and there's a bug or somebody sold

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
the plugin

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
to some other company that said hey

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
we're going to buy and support your

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
plugin here's some money thank you and

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,840
now they have supply chain attack

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
against any website using its plugin

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
great right

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
but thankfully you would not believe

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
there are plugins for fixing compromised

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
wordpress websites

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
don't

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
this is not the solution right uh just

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,199
make regular tested backups

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
another way of dealing with uh with uh

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,320
let's say uh website downtime mainly

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
when it's related to censorship right

135
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
mainly when there are some bad people on

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
the internet somewhere that decide you

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
know what people should not see your

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
website we don't like we don't like your

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
website and nobody should like your

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,960
website nobody

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
should see your website

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
is you know tor i2p these kinds of these

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
kinds of tools that give people like us

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
access to websites that other people

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
don't want us to have access to right

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
the problem with these tools these are

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
amazing tools and i love them fondly and

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
i use them all the time the problem with

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,039
them from the perspective of a person

150
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
running a popular ish news website is

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,479
that

152
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,360
it is

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,240
uh

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
unreasonable to expect that the

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
population of a whole country switches

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
to tor browser just to keep seeing your

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
website that's not going to happen

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
there's going to be a you know a bunch

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,639
of people who will who will do this and

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
i strongly strongly implore you to have

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
a you know

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
onion hidden service for your for your

163
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
website that's always a good idea just

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
just do it it's really not that much

165
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
work

166
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,560
but

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
but

168
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
making sure that your website is

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,039
available in places where it might be

170
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
censored is not a tor shaped problem tor

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,600
shape's problem is i want to have access

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,759
to a website that is censored it's not

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
i want my website to be accessible to

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
everyone uh for whom it is censored

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
right it's just the other side of the

176
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
coin

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
so yeah like website visitors or your

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
website visitors will not switch to

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
those tools uh on mass and the same goes

180
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
for brave same goes for the changing dns

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
settings all of this we've seen

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
situations where

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
changing dns settings did happen and

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
mass right but that is not something you

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
can really expect and rely on if you're

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,919
running a website uh that you want to

187
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
stay up uh in places like i don't know

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,560
azerbaijan right

189
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,919
so

190
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
then you know the the standard response

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,319
is well you can always use cloudflare

192
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
right cloudflare is great

193
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,199
and uh apparently about like 19 19 of

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,280
all websites think that this is a good

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,319
solution

196
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,960
and just by the by the virtue of that

197
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
number that tells me that this is not a

198
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,360
good solution right like centralizing

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,039
things giving 20 almost 20

200
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
of all websites to be controlled and man

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
in the middle by a single company

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
yeah i i don't think i don't think

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
that's a great solution i'm i'm sure

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
that cloudflare service is is great but

205
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,160
it's it's just it does it strikes me as

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
a little bit um

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,639
uh odd especially that those those

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
companies will drop your site like a hot

209
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,479
potato if it's just unconvenient for

210
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,919
them to continue hosting your site

211
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,639
and as as the ceo of cloudflare said

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
right after they took down daily stormer

213
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,759
um

214
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
a small number of companies will largely

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
determine what can and cannot be online

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
and as much as as i am the on the polar

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
opposite of political spectrum as from

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
the daily stormer uh i also find this

219
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
disturbing right this is too much power

220
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
for a private company to be able to say

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
we have you know almost 20

222
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,400
websites of like all of the whole

223
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
internet uh we can just decide which

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
ones stay up and which would go down

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
that's great right

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
um

227
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
so uh

228
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
we will have a talk uh hands up who will

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
have a talk with me boom these guys uh

230
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,039
in two hours at 4 p.m in envelope

231
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
not talk sorry workshop on making sense

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,639
of social media freedom speech freedom

233
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
of speech and fascists

234
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,000
and i do have opinions on the daily

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,160
stormer situation but this talk is not

236
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,599
about that the workshop will be more

237
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
about that so if if you want to have

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
this conversation let's have it there

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,960
um

240
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
today yeah 4 pm envelope

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,479
and so but the problem with centralizing

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,640
putting all of our eggs in in those few

243
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,039
few baskets like amazon aws

244
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,000
uh

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
cloudflare fastly akamai these guys

246
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
right it's not just that that the

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,399
decision that they might make right it's

248
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
not just like oh we don't like this

249
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
website we're gonna take you down

250
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
because they're too big an operation to

251
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
really care about most of those websites

252
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
uh but

253
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
the bigger the bigger problem is also

254
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
that all of those companies um

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
tend to go down on a regular basis

256
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,160
have you noticed this like so uh fastly

257
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,480
outage june 22nd to 2021 akamai a major

258
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
outage due to dns bugs uh it's never it

259
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
cannot be dns it's never dns it was dns

260
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,680
uh july 23rd last year

261
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
then amazon web services uh third outage

262
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
in a month december 22nd last year and

263
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
cloudflare outage june 21st

264
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
today right if you have if you happen to

265
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
use all four of them

266
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
right and i have seen websites that use

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
all four of them for some inexplicable

268
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
reason because it's just easier to you

269
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,600
know uh hotlink a a piece of javascript

270
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
from fastly and you know you have some

271
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,120
of your content on akamai and then you

272
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
have some your website is behind

273
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
cloudflare and then there's something on

274
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
cloudfront because somebody put it there

275
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
what are you what you're gonna do right

276
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
now you have all of those four companies

277
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,279
all of their infrastructure has to stay

278
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,080
up for your website to stay up and over

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,279
the last year

280
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
more than four times they went down

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
right so now you quadrupled your chance

282
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,519
that your website will be down and

283
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
um

284
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,959
yeah

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,399
and there's nothing really you can do

286
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,720
once once once it down like an outage

287
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
like this hits right because you don't

288
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
know how long it will be you don't know

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,320
how much energy you can

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
uh invest into this and because maybe

291
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
that will be up in five minutes or you

292
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
know three hours or it's a facebook

293
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
shaped uh

294
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
screw-up and you know

295
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
how long is the eight hours of global

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,160
outage that was fascinating

297
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,120
anyway

298
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,200
the point is people make mistakes

299
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
yes people make mistakes there should be

300
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
okay there

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,279
software has bugs and hardware fails and

302
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
monocultures are not resilient right uh

303
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,440
if you have if you have plenty of small

304
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
companies that handle a small part of of

305
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
the internet infrastructure then any

306
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,560
single one of them going down is not

307
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
that much of a deal right a person

308
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
making a mistake at like a small

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
provider somewhere yes some users will

310
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
lose access to the internet or some

311
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,040
websites will go down but it's not 20 of

312
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
the internet going down because somebody

313
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
made a mistake or some software had a

314
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
bug right where you put all your eggs in

315
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
in those few huge gigantic

316
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,440
enormous galaxy sized baskets

317
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
then a a

318
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,320
proper proper bug proper correct

319
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
correctly placed a mistake

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
will take 20 of the internet down and

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
that's kind of you know not really okay

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120
uh and then who here uses cloudflare

323
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,880
yes so if something goes pear-shaped uh

324
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
really pear-shaped uh switching from

325
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
cloudflare to

326
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
like to get your website off of

327
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,959
cloudflare can take up to 48 hours right

328
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,320
because you have to make you have to

329
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
move the ns records you have to move the

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
name servers somewhere else and ttl on

331
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
those is usually 24 hours

332
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
uh and then caching so

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,760
now you have now you now you have to

334
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
make a decision do you wait for

335
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
cloudflare to go up or you wait 48 hours

336
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
for your website to you know start uh

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
start working again

338
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,519
this is this is i find that problematic

339
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,639
right

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
on the other hand of course it would be

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
quite unreasonable to expect that every

342
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
news website or investigative journalism

343
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,440
outlet or or you know human rights

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
organization would roll

345
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
out their own self-hosted infrastructure

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
that would be the size of cloudflare so

347
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
that it would uh it could uh ingest or

348
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,600
handle huge spikes of traffic and

349
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
gigantic ddoses and all that that's not

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
going to happen right those

351
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
organizations are sadly

352
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
extremely underfunded they're running on

353
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
shoestring

354
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,240
budgets if there are any founders of

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
founders here please by all means fund

356
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
those organizations more especially

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
their their tech departments they really

358
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,320
really need this and funding tech uh

359
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
like infrastructure in those

360
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,800
organizations and information security

361
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
in those organizations somehow is not

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
considered sexy

363
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
whatever that means

364
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
please reconsider if if

365
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
if you have the the power to fund those

366
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,200
organizations a little bit better but

367
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,720
yes infrastructure is expensive and

368
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,279
no single organization will be able to

369
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
you know deploy a large enough

370
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,519
infrastructure to to be able to

371
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,760
withstand huge spikes of traffic on

372
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
their own this is just not not going to

373
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
happen hence we have cloudflares and

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,959
akamais of this world but maybe those

375
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,800
costs could be shared maybe we could

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
pool those resources right maybe we

377
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
could have

378
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
multiple organizations saying look we

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
have an infrastructure usually our

380
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,880
traffic is you know let's say 10 of our

381
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
of our capacity right uh so we have 90

382
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
margin in case our traffic goes up let's

383
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
say we have 10 of those organizations

384
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
pulling resources and saying

385
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
so now we suddenly have access to the

386
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
bandwidth of all of those organizations

387
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,680
if hits the fan on our website we

388
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
can rely on this bandwidth right

389
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,839
so that's kind of that's kind of the

390
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,720
idea that i have of trying to

391
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,839
create a

392
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
piece of software that would allow us to

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
build a community cdn

394
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
that multiple organizations could come

395
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
together and say you know use we're

396
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,120
using this software on our website and

397
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,760
if if our website goes you know if our

398
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
infrastructure goes down the website

399
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,440
will continue to stay up

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
thanks to the other organizations in our

401
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
little cluster in our little community

402
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,959
right and

403
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
the way it would have to work

404
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
is uh

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
pooling the infrastructure and resources

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
of multiple organizations

407
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,760
and originally no new infrastructure uh

408
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
uh investment should be necessary right

409
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
because that's not gonna happen you're

410
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
not gonna convince uh you know 10 ngos

411
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
like hey how about you invest a lot into

412
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,959
this shiny new thing to build this whole

413
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
new infrastructure that's not going to

414
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
happen right so this has to work on the

415
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
infrastructure they all they already

416
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
have if they're self-hosting right uh

417
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,880
there's there has to be minimal

418
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
organizational overhead no new entity or

419
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,040
organization or anything like that that

420
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
needs to be set up and saying okay we're

421
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,279
gonna you know set up a new organization

422
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
put all of our infrastructure budget in

423
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,959
that organization and that will

424
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
like uh handle the infrastructure needs

425
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
for all of those organizations the

426
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
cluster that's not gonna happen because

427
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,079
that's too much organizational overhead

428
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
right those organizations will not agree

429
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,519
uh

430
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
to to do this because it also gives away

431
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
a little bit of power it also gives away

432
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
a little bit of control and that's kind

433
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
of like

434
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,839
difficult

435
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,120
uh

436
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
this uh the thing that i'm thinking

437
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
about and i will start describing it in

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,600
a moment

439
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
would kick in only when a site is down

440
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
the reason why i think this is a good

441
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,000
thing and not everyone might agree the

442
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
reason why i think it's a good thing is

443
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
because you can tell all those let's say

444
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
10 organizations look we're building

445
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,440
this cluster this magical community cdn

446
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
cluster thing uh but until the websites

447
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
are running fine you will not have any

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
new bandwidth costs right no random band

449
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,320
no no random requests will start hitting

450
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
your infrastructure immediately it's

451
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
only where something when something is

452
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
actually happening

453
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
with with website of one of those

454
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
organizations where when when the

455
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,839
bandwidth of other organizations is

456
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
starting to be used right

457
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
uh no tls private keys shared and no

458
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
other kind of benevolent monster in the

459
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
middle situation right if you're using

460
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
cloudflare cloudflare sits like uh

461
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
terminates your tls uh so it can

462
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
technically see

463
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
your traffic and and all of this this is

464
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
not something that i would be okay with

465
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,160
and and many organizations that i'm

466
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
thinking about of like

467
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,199
suggesting that they should use this

468
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
kind of approach would also not be okay

469
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
with um

470
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
which is one of the reasons why some of

471
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,519
those organizations are just not using

472
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
cloudflare uh so i also want to avoid

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,880
this

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,639
monster in the middle situation

475
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
uh and it absolutely has to be

476
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
transparent for visitors in the sense of

477
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
no no uh special software or a special

478
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
setup needed on the part of visitors

479
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
right a person who had been visiting

480
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
your website should for them the website

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
should just work even if it doesn't uh i

482
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
know it sounds weird but trust me we're

483
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
going to get there right

484
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,639
and the reason why this is important is

485
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
what i said before right

486
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,920
millions of people in the country will

487
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,439
not download the tor browser millions of

488
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,720
people in the country will not download

489
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
your special snowflake solution to

490
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,400
whatever problem you're trying to to

491
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,720
solve you have to like

492
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,079
my my

493
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,880
my aim is to try to figure out a way uh

494
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,439
such that uh visitors don't have to do

495
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,039
anything right website admins deploy

496
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
this and visitors like okay yeah it

497
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,480
works oh it works a little bit slower i

498
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,679
wonder what's happening what's happening

499
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,880
is your website is down and now it's

500
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
pulling content from somewhere else but

501
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,840
the visitor is like yeah okay that just

502
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
works fine

503
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
there are quite a few assumptions here

504
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
uh so this will not work for certain

505
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
situations one of the assumptions is

506
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,600
that the visitors must be using modern

507
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,679
mainstream browsers because

508
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
i'm relying heavily on

509
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
modern

510
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,400
you know web

511
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
apis and stuff i will explain in a

512
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,559
moment and javascript has to be enabled

513
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
so again not everyone uh not everyone

514
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,039
will be happy right that's why i said

515
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,720
run an onion

516
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
onion hidden service for everyone who is

517
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
not happy with this setup because they

518
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,400
will probably have a tor browser already

519
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
and they will be very happy to use it

520
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
right

521
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
as i do

522
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,520
this

523
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
the solution that i'll be talking about

524
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
is not going to work for massively

525
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,799
dynamic web applications think facebook

526
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
or or twitter like twitter shaped things

527
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
right where the content just flows

528
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
constantly and and all of that right

529
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
this is uh this is more i'm focusing

530
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
more on

531
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,080
somewhat static sites think news sites

532
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
right where there's a

533
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
bit of content published every now and

534
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
then and every now and then of course

535
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,520
can be uh can be quite frequently it can

536
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,960
be you know many times a day or many

537
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,960
times an hour but the the let's say

538
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
the shape of content is kind of like

539
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
uh it can be approximated by a static

540
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
site right it can still be a dynamic

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
site can still you know do dynamic

542
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
things but you you should be able to

543
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,280
cache

544
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
a piece of content right as let's say

545
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
html html file or statify the site

546
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
somehow right

547
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,559
so so

548
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
yeah

549
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
obviously this has to work with any any

550
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,600
content type but currently huge files

551
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
are tricky for reasons that might become

552
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
obvious in a moment

553
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,360
uh and video streaming is really not a

554
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
thing with uh with with what i'm

555
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
building uh because i have to somehow

556
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,799
limit the the scope right there's

557
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
trying to do everything at the same time

558
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,760
is going to be

559
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
difficult and finally and i promise this

560
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
is the last slide about assumptions

561
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
it is not meant for sensitive content

562
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,240
this this this tool is meant for

563
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
the point of this tool is keeping public

564
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
content online it's not about you know

565
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
distributing sensitive content if you

566
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
need this kind of stuff again hidden

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
onion services like authorized hidden

568
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
onion services there's plenty of tools

569
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
for for for that kind of thing and it's

570
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,440
not meant for your

571
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
for any after login area of the website

572
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,280
so it's not meant to

573
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,080
keep your admin interface running it is

574
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
meant to keep your public site running

575
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
if like solutions for keeping the admin

576
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
interface running can be different there

577
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
you can have a special vpn or you know

578
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
all of these things and i'm happy to

579
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
talk about this uh you know after the

580
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
after the talk with with you if you if

581
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
you would like to to hear my my thoughts

582
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,679
about this uh but this specifically

583
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
focuses on the public side like a public

584
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
public content on your

585
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,960
uh

586
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
on your website uh and

587
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,159
splitting it this way also i feel has

588
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,400
security benefits right because if you

589
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
if you split it this way your public

590
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,159
site is public right but it has no way

591
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
of interfacing with the with the admin

592
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
uh interface that means that you know a

593
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,360
script kitty will not use a

594
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,840
wordpress bug to take over your site

595
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,720
right

596
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,799
but that's somewhat beside the point

597
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,400
okay

598
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
i mentioned same setup um

599
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,039
and and i will just go quickly through

600
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,240
this what this means to me as i

601
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
mentioned is limiting plugins and

602
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
complexity um

603
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
static site generators if it's something

604
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
that can work for you i would strongly

605
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,520
recommend this if you want your your

606
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
website to be you know uh

607
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
resilience to

608
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
reasonably high traffic caching and

609
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
micro caching i'm happy to talk about

610
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
this with with whoever wants to talk

611
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
about this after the after the talk

612
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,720
because that's a whole separate ball of

613
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
hairy things um

614
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
and and that's something i see in a lot

615
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,039
of websites that they us like they

616
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
configure their whatever wordpress or or

617
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
whatever cms they're running

618
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
they hard code the domain

619
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,600
right which means if you're a small news

620
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
organization somewhere in caucasus or or

621
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,400
or

622
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
or the balkans and you get blocked for

623
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
whatever reason

624
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,919
usually the easiest thing that comes to

625
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
your mind is oh we can just get a new

626
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
domain and

627
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,200
put our website on that domain right

628
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
send this to our

629
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,760
users oh we cannot because the cms

630
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
enforces the old domain

631
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
and now you have a bigger problem right

632
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
so thinking about this this is something

633
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
that i haven't noticed that many people

634
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,000
think about thinking about this when you

635
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
set up the website

636
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
is really important and just say you

637
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,720
know what i don't need to have the

638
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
domain hard-coded i don't i really

639
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,559
relative links are fine

640
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
right and that also means that if you

641
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,919
move to a different domain your website

642
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
will still work right which

643
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
yay

644
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,919
okay uh so

645
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,480
let's get to the interesting things when

646
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,720
the site goes down right we have a we

647
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,559
have you have a news website the the

648
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,799
website goes down let's say it's blocked

649
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,840
because

650
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,159
something

651
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,600
and

652
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
when this happens you are you have a

653
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,559
chicken and egg problem right let's say

654
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,159
you set up a separate domain your

655
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
website was you know sane

656
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,080
it works on the separate domain how do

657
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,919
you put this information out to the

658
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,559
users right the best way to inform your

659
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,559
visitors that there's a new domain would

660
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,280
be to use your website but your website

661
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,400
is down

662
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
it's kind of

663
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
difficult right so you can use social

664
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,559
media you can use all those things but

665
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
for a lot of users the default place

666
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
that they visit to get information from

667
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
your website or about your website is

668
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
your website so

669
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
chicken and egg

670
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
but we can try to fix this with service

671
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
workers anyone is familiar with service

672
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,280
workers

673
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
okay so service workers

674
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,760
uh are this uh is this web api that is

675
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,000
relatively new i would say five years

676
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
ish maybe in in

677
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,679
production state

678
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,799
and the idea is a website

679
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,720
uh sends a piece of code and tells the

680
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,159
browser when the visitor visits the

681
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,039
website hey from this point on this bit

682
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,000
of code

683
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
handles all of the requests that are

684
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,000
done in the context of this website all

685
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
of them right so all of the requests to

686
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
the domain and all of the requests that

687
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,960
in that originate from the loaded page

688
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
to any domain right

689
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,080
and this piece of code gets cached

690
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,840
and this piece of code the browser then

691
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,960
remembers

692
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
uh such that even if you close all the

693
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,240
tabs close the browser all of this

694
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
you

695
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,000
three weeks later you visit the site and

696
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
what happens is that this code is

697
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,440
brought up from the cache

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
handles your requests right what this

699
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
means is we can do

700
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
reasonably um interesting things because

701
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
yeah as i said once registered the

702
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
service worker kicks in the moment a

703
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,880
request is fired including before the

704
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
website is loaded as long as the service

705
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,039
worker had been loaded before right so

706
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
for anyone who had visited your site

707
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,840
once

708
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
this code is there it's already cached

709
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,799
it's going to run it's going to be there

710
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,760
for for a month or longer um and it will

711
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
handle all the requests right so this

712
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
allows us to you know obviously cache

713
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
the content in browser just say you know

714
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,320
if you pull this content cache it and

715
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,919
the next time the user loads this page

716
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
if the page is not working just show the

717
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,400
cached content but that's boring right

718
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,840
there plenty of people are doing that

719
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,600
already and that's kind of boring but

720
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
you can do what you can also do

721
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,720
uh is

722
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
you can pull the content from anywhere

723
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
else

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
this is your code you can just do fetch

725
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
requests anywhere else you can do

726
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,480
alternative endpoints meaning

727
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
your website is down a returning visitor

728
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
comes to your website right

729
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
service worker gets gets spun up and the

730
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
service worker says

731
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,000
uh

732
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
hold on the website is not is not

733
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,520
responding but i know that i can get

734
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
this content also from these

735
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
secondary domains so i'm just going to

736
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
pull this content from secondary domains

737
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,120
boom from the perspective of the user

738
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
the website just works it's maybe a

739
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,240
little bit slower because it has to

740
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
first figure out that the fetch request

741
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
to the original website doesn't work but

742
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,520
like okay half a second longer oh no

743
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,799
right

744
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,919
uh so this is this is uh what i would

745
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,440
have been working as a project called

746
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
lib resilient and maybe you can even see

747
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,360
the url there resilience.is

748
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
and

749
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
what it does is it it implements all of

750
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,080
the above right it implements the

751
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
service work it implements the plugins

752
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
for you know caching and pulling content

753
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,679
from random places

754
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,480
and

755
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
it has a configurable order of

756
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
operations uh which means we can do

757
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,679
something like this right we can say hey

758
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,240
once when you get a request for content

759
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,400
related to this website and coming from

760
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,039
the domain of this website please first

761
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
fetch to the from the original domain

762
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
right if that works great just cache

763
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
that content provide it to the user

764
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,520
we're done but if the if the fetch

765
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,799
doesn't work because the let's say the

766
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
backend domain the original domain is

767
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,640
down okay do we have it in cache maybe

768
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,679
we do great maybe we don't what do we do

769
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,679
we do we go to alternative end points

770
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,840
right we we say hey

771
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,679
okay fetch didn't work we didn't have a

772
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,640
cache

773
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,159
but i know that this content should be

774
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
available in these five different

775
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,279
endpoints so i'm going to just pull it

776
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,520
uh plum it from pub pilot from there

777
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
right and whichever succeeds first

778
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,640
the first successful remote fetch gets

779
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,200
cached and boom the user now has access

780
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,080
to this

781
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
uh content and again it just works the

782
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
the the visitor has no clue what was

783
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
happening

784
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,679
behind the scenes

785
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,840
and for example just just to throw it

786
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
out there possible alternative end

787
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,440
points you know way back machine right

788
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
if you if your website is on wayback

789
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
machine boom you have a alternative

790
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,720
endpoint for free

791
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
you can literally just fetch your

792
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
content from wayback machine great right

793
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
you can have

794
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,159
public folders on on major cloud

795
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,240
services they will hate you for this you

796
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
know one little trick to make cloud

797
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
services hate you

798
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
but it would work right you just fetch

799
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
from the public

800
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,159
public folder

801
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,240
uh and the user just

802
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
doesn't even have to think about this i

803
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
this is not my favorite way of doing

804
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
this but it is possible and of course

805
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
any https host uh you can push content

806
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
to really right so for example you could

807
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,679
push content to ipfs and fetch it from

808
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
ipss gateways

809
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,440
right boom

810
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
again you can rely on on infrastructure

811
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,039
of ipfs

812
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,000
to uh to fetch your content right

813
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,399
okay uh so

814
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,639
uh

815
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,559
multiple alternative endpoints can be

816
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
configured at the same time right so you

817
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
can have a configuration that says look

818
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,279
if the original domain is down you can

819
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,279
fetch it from here here here here or

820
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,240
here right and then a random every every

821
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,159
uh every request a random alternative

822
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,320
endpoint is is selected to pull content

823
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
from and several can be used

824
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,520
simultaneously so you can have an and

825
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,679
out of m situation of saying like i have

826
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,559
five configured try two of them randomly

827
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,320
just in case one of them will be down

828
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
right so you're uh you're making more

829
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,880
requests but you're also maximizing the

830
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
chance that even if one of the alternate

831
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
event points is down the user will still

832
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,279
get uh get the content

833
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,640
this is probably the question that you

834
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,399
have in your heads right now uh what

835
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,320
about like okay but those end points

836
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
have access to your content they can

837
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
modify this content they can be

838
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
malicious right oh no what do we do

839
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,559
about this uh sub resource integrity to

840
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,240
the rescue anyone here is familiar with

841
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
subresource integrity

842
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
okay so what subresource integrity does

843
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
is uh you have some kind of a resource

844
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,480
let's say a script that you're pulling

845
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
from let's say fastly because that's

846
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,159
what was made for it was made for those

847
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,679
large cdn's

848
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
and

849
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
the you you you use the link but you

850
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
also add the in the integrity hash so in

851
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,760
html is just like you know uh script you

852
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
know uh

853
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
ref uh blah blah blah and then integrity

854
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
equals there's a hash and the browser

855
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
what the browser does is it pulls the

856
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
content verifies the hash

857
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
before giving the content back to the to

858
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
the client side

859
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,399
right uh which means if you have the

860
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,240
hash of all the content

861
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,559
uh you don't have to care because if

862
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,320
somebody is maliciously modifying the

863
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
the stuff on the alternative endpoints

864
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
your browser will just say nope sorry

865
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,120
the hash doesn't match uh bye-bye right

866
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
but this again

867
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760
so but in html we can only set integrity

868
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,840
attributes on script and link elements

869
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
thankfully uh in javascript we can set

870
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
integrity hashes on any request and

871
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
because uh because we're doing this in

872
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
in javascript because it's a service

873
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,559
worker blah blah blah all of this we can

874
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
set integrity hashes on every request so

875
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
i tested this with video i tested this

876
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,159
with images i tested this with all sorts

877
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,080
of content and the browser just happily

878
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,399
says okay i'm pulling some content

879
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,240
hash match is great here you are or hash

880
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,840
doesn't matter well screw off right

881
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
and yes there's a there's already a

882
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,760
plugin for this in in in liv resilience

883
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
so that that's already implemented but

884
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
then

885
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
that's not that easy right but then how

886
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,799
can you distribute integrity hashes

887
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,559
safely without having to trust

888
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,799
alternative endpoint operators right

889
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,720
because you have the the the service

890
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
worker has to get those hashes somehow

891
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,880
it can either have them pre-configured

892
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,159
which is boring because now you cannot

893
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,880
push new content or it can have you can

894
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
pull them for example from those

895
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
alternative endpoints but we don't trust

896
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,279
those alternative endpoints that is the

897
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,440
whole point of distributing those hashes

898
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
what do we do what do we do asymmetric

899
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,440
crypto um right we can

900
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,679
another plugin already implemented

901
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
verifying uh fetched content using

902
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,919
signed integrity data right so what

903
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,279
happens is

904
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,039
initial setup of your website you

905
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,200
generate private and public key pair on

906
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
your server side

907
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
you configure the public the public key

908
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
in live resilience config and you use

909
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,919
the signed integrity plugin and the sign

910
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,159
integrity plugin during publishing what

911
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,159
you do is you publish you generate the

912
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,840
integrity hash of every piece of content

913
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
image whatever you're publishing

914
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,720
you put it in a java web token

915
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
magic magic magic uh

916
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
signed with the private key generated

917
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,600
before and you put the jwt

918
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
in a file available under whatever the

919
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,399
uri of the original content is dot

920
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,960
integrity right and this is what this is

921
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
what this plugin expects when it's

922
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
working in the service worker on the

923
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,360
client side

924
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,200
when it's fetching content let's say

925
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,519
it's fetching

926
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,120
favicon.ico right what it will do first

927
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
it will fetch favicon dot ico dot

928
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
integrity verify the signature get the

929
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,720
hash out of it

930
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,039
verify pull the pull the five icon dot

931
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,559
ico verify the hash boom uh it works or

932
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,640
or it doesn't work right so what this

933
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,799
means is we have a we can have content

934
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,720
delivery even or with the original

935
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
website is down thanks to service

936
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,039
workers

937
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,840
uh we can verify the fetched content uh

938
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
has not been tampered with thanks thanks

939
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
to suppressors integrity and the signed

940
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,240
integrity plugin and it all works on

941
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
regular browsers no special settings

942
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
necessary if you are using any of the

943
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,600
you know

944
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
modern browsers

945
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
all of this already works all the all

946
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,679
the plumbing is already there right

947
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,120
so what we can have exactly this imagine

948
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,519
10 organizations that say okay we're

949
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,039
going to deploy the brazilian on all our

950
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
websites and we're going to serve as

951
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,640
alternative endpoints for each other

952
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,440
right

953
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,240
you have a community cdn where no new

954
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
infrastructure needs to be deployed the

955
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
only cost is

956
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,960
uh is a storage space right because each

957
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
of those websites has to be mirrored on

958
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
each of those the organization's

959
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
infrastructures that's that's the only

960
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,360
thing

961
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,120
uh the the bandwidth costs kick in only

962
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
uh when one of the websites is down

963
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
right because with this config it's like

964
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,480
does the website work it works here's

965
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,080
your content if it doesn't work well

966
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
alternative endpoints right other orgs

967
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,000
infrastructures pooling right

968
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
you don't have to trust them that much

969
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,880
right because you can you you are

970
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,840
pushing

971
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
the content along with the integrity

972
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
files so the service worker will verify

973
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
this right so you don't even have to

974
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,159
trust those organizations like

975
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,159
to not modify your content you only have

976
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,720
to trust them in the sense that uh they

977
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
will not maliciously screw screw you up

978
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,720
in the sense of like deleting content or

979
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
anything like that but if it's a group

980
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,399
of organizations doing similar things

981
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
perhaps that's not an entirely

982
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
unreasonable assumption

983
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,080
and it is completely transparent for

984
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,880
visitors right so everything i promised

985
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,399
there you go on this black screen that

986
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,720
has nothing on it

987
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,039
so yeah a group of organizations running

988
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
its own their own hosting infrastructure

989
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,600
serving as alternative endpoints for for

990
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960
one another

991
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,559
i think i have about five minutes right

992
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,360
now

993
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
so and i have i think three slides

994
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,760
this is doable uh not mentioned here uh

995
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,839
configuration changes during downtime

996
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,918
right let's say your website is down and

997
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,839
you decided ah you i have to change

998
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,040
alternative endpoints some of those

999
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,280
organizations also went down or now

1000
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,599
don't want to don't want to deal with me

1001
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,199
i set up new alternative endpoints what

1002
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,119
do i do how do i tell the users who have

1003
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,679
already loaded the service worker uh

1004
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,639
that there are new alternative endpoints

1005
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,040
well if at least one alternative

1006
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,199
endpoint already configured works you

1007
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,520
just push a config update

1008
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,280
boom and this goes through the same

1009
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,199
plumbing as any other request because

1010
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,679
it's just config.json file so

1011
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,399
config.json.config.json.integrity

1012
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
boom any user who has

1013
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,079
visited your website before has the

1014
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,719
service worker loaded and

1015
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,159
as long as at least one of the alternate

1016
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,239
endpoints works already

1017
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,440
pulls in the update uh and and boom has

1018
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
access to the new alternative endpoints

1019
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,720
or the new uh config

1020
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,079
i have not talked about deployment and

1021
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,480
publishing pipeline uh because that

1022
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
depends very much on the setup of each

1023
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
website if you're using a static site

1024
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,760
there is going to be a bus script a make

1025
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,240
file a gitlab ci cd pipeline or

1026
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,520
something like that that pushes content

1027
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
to your site well we can just add some

1028
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
steps that pushes this content to ipfs

1029
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,599
or your friendly organizations or your

1030
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,480
whatever google drive and uh you know at

1031
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,160
the same time and and calculates the

1032
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,040
integrity files uh along along with that

1033
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,480
there is a faq can you read the link

1034
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
there there's going to be a more visible

1035
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,200
link

1036
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
at the end

1037
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
current status of the resilient code

1038
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
exists works and has

1039
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,800
decent code code test coverage um uh all

1040
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
of the plugins that uh that i was

1041
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,160
talking about today have 90 or more uh

1042
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,800
test coverage so uh yay

1043
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,640
documentation largely exists but

1044
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
definitely needs improvements

1045
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,079
if somebody wants to read through this

1046
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
and tell me oh no i don't understand how

1047
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,160
this works this is weird then i'm very

1048
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
happy to hear that and improve because

1049
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
when i write this documentation i'm all

1050
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
in my head i understand all of this i

1051
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
don't know which things might be

1052
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,839
completely weird or or surprising

1053
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
this has not yet been deployed in

1054
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,440
production on any large site but i have

1055
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,599
i know that i know of two reasonably

1056
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,680
large projects that are testing it and

1057
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,640
might might deploy it at some point but

1058
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
testing improvements ideas criticism all

1059
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,839
of this is very welcome please you know

1060
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,599
come at me

1061
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
and the project got a small grant from

1062
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,680
nlnet which i highly recommend those

1063
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
guys are also at mch and you should find

1064
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,200
them somewhere there

1065
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
uh somewhere there sorry uh and they

1066
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
have more money for interesting projects

1067
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
so you also should you know try uh try

1068
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,520
uh try uh with your project if you have

1069
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,560
a project

1070
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,280
possible next steps uh wordpress plugin

1071
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,040
because why would wordpress not why

1072
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,599
should wordpress not be able to uh to

1073
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,560
push

1074
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,079
stuff you know along with integrity

1075
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
files and all of this to some places uh

1076
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
that makes sense uh reverse proxies can

1077
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
be alternative endpoints i haven't used

1078
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
them i prefer the static approach i

1079
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
prefer the approach of here's content

1080
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,160
files because this decouples the

1081
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,920
alternative endpoints from your backend

1082
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
server uh meaning if you're using

1083
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
reverse proxies if your backend server

1084
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,960
is down your reverse proxies are

1085
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,400
probably also done or unless they do

1086
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
some interesting caching right but this

1087
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,760
is totally doable and totally crazy

1088
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,079
ideas and this is almost the last slide

1089
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,119
uh why not use ipns and ipfs as content

1090
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,720
transfer directly in the browser well

1091
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
there's a bug with ipns and i could i

1092
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
could rant about this over beer uh

1093
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,000
because it hasn't been fixed for three

1094
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,160
years uh but once they fix this bug we

1095
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
might be able to just use ipns ipfs

1096
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,720
directly without hitting uh

1097
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
ipfs gateways as

1098
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,640
alternate event points

1099
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,119
we could use i want to test web torrent

1100
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
as content the content transport again

1101
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,640
not alternative endpoints just a

1102
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
completely alternative transport uh

1103
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
plugin that just pulls stuff from from

1104
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,119
the cloud

1105
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,920
and merge requests are welcome and other

1106
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,079
non-standard decentralized weird uh

1107
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,160
fascinating transport plugins i'm all

1108
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,440
ears if anybody wants to talk to me

1109
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,200
about this and and figure out things to

1110
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
do together and the website is

1111
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,280
resilient.is there's a blog there's

1112
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,520
documentation there's code it's very

1113
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,240
simple website uh thank you questions

1114
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,900
woof i made it wow

1115
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:30,249
[Applause]

1116
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,359
you still had

1117
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,079
you still had you still had one minute

1118
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,560
awesome oh i'm sorry

1119
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
i could have spoken that tiny bit slower

1120
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,880
then yes

1121
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,480
but understandable all right we have

1122
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,280
questions microphone in the front please

1123
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,839
um any ideas about first-time visitors

1124
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,119
like how to solve this problem for

1125
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,839
first-time visitors no

1126
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,119
no but

1127
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,560
again from my experience of running

1128
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
these kinds of websites

1129
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
most of the visitors are first time are

1130
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,920
are returning visitors usually right and

1131
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,440
uh and so i

1132
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
i found a way to solve this problem i

1133
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,119
haven't found the way of solving the the

1134
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,800
first visitors problem because you have

1135
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,280
to load this code somehow right uh i

1136
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,119
would love to to have a way of um okay

1137
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,400
so let's say you have a static website

1138
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,839
let's say you have static website with

1139
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
relative links that means you can just

1140
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,040
zip it

1141
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,960
you can literally just distribute

1142
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
zips on on on uh thumb drives on the

1143
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,760
sneaker net right i would love to have a

1144
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
way of distributing this code with the

1145
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,000
zip and saying hey if you're if you're

1146
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,160
if you receive this zip to the zip file

1147
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
to

1148
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,560
experience this website click this and

1149
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,800
now you can go online and it will just

1150
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,560
pull stuff but that's not how this works

1151
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
unfortunately service workers can only

1152
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,560
be installed either from localhost or

1153
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,760
from https endpoints and and so if i

1154
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,119
find a way to

1155
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,520
you know go around this uh such that i

1156
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
can install a service worker in a user's

1157
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,320
browser from a zip file then

1158
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
awesome right but yeah that's that's a

1159
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,680
very very valid question

1160
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,560
so this will also break if we finally

1161
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,160
teach people to clear the browser

1162
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
and browser profiles i think we don't

1163
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,079
have to worry about that i don't think

1164
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,359
they will ever learn

1165
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,319
but yes uh this is this also used to not

1166
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,800
work in firefox private mode uh or

1167
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
incognito mode or whatever they call it

1168
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,520
this week

1169
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,720
but

1170
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
but uh i think they they enabled it

1171
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,119
right so yes there will be browsers and

1172
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,599
there will be configurations uh where

1173
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,079
this will not work for users

1174
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,000
i usually use my most of my browsers

1175
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
with javascript completely disabled so

1176
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,359
that would not work for me but also

1177
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,359
people who have javascript mostly

1178
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,760
disabled also probably have tor so yes

1179
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,520
onion tour sites on your like hidden

1180
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
services please

1181
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
yes

1182
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
first thanks for the talks

1183
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,160
and i didn't get one things the idea is

1184
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,880
that

1185
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
a group of organizations

1186
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,359
uh stay together and install and

1187
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
configure libra resilient

1188
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,480
to uh and so to have kind of many island

1189
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,680
where

1190
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,160
many different group organizations can

1191
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,599
pick up each other

1192
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
so yes so each website let's say you

1193
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,560
have 10 websites right each website has

1194
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
live resilient configured and has okay

1195
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,880
this is my main site but all of the

1196
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,400
other uh

1197
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,599
website like

1198
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,720
infrastructure of all the other

1199
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,560
organizations clear yeah

1200
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,960
the question is uh do the organization

1201
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
have to find each other

1202
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,319
uh somewhere i mean if i want to

1203
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,200
install

1204
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,520
libre resilient how can i find some

1205
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,599
other organization that want to rare

1206
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,359
with me so that's that's uh

1207
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,160
so

1208
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,040
live resilient itself uh is just install

1209
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
it on your uh on your website and you

1210
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
have to figure out where your

1211
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,200
alternative endpoints are and where

1212
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,720
you're pushing your code and all of this

1213
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
right this is up to the website admin to

1214
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,839
figure out what they can rely on as far

1215
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,040
as the alternative endpoints are

1216
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,640
concerned right

1217
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,920
but what i what i realized after i wrote

1218
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
most of this this code is okay but if we

1219
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
have a group of organizations they can

1220
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,319
rely on each other right they can they

1221
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,319
can pull their resources together using

1222
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,640
live resilient in a way that i don't

1223
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,319
think was possible before or i have not

1224
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,119
seen

1225
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,800
this kind of this kind of resource

1226
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,880
pooling which does not require either a

1227
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,079
separate entity or or some kind of tls

1228
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,040
private keys sharing situation or or

1229
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,880
anything like that right so that's

1230
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,560
that's the i think the the innovative

1231
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,640
part of of the talk right but yes for

1232
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,480
for lip resilient itself you just have

1233
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,079
to figure out your alternate points

1234
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,079
yourself

1235
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,800
i'm going to be a bit anti-http because

1236
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,599
i think it's tends to reinvent wheels

1237
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,520
all the time most other protocols use

1238
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
srv records for this purpose

1239
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,480
and i know the http workgroup in the

1240
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,119
ietf is working on a different record

1241
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,839
specifically for http which also allows

1242
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,000
you to prioritize where you come from

1243
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,640
and even segments of your website can be

1244
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,359
uh separately redirected

1245
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,079
so that there will be a general solution

1246
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,359
that might even be

1247
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,400
uh might even end up in browsers

1248
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,440
inshallah uh but it's not there yet uh

1249
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,880
there are things like out and you've

1250
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,119
seen defined sv records

1251
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,160
yeah yeah

1252
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,760
but the browsers will have to read them

1253
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960
and and and

1254
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
apply them right

1255
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,960
and it will still have to

1256
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,839
be specified such that it works kind of

1257
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,480
like hsts which is like these are the

1258
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,280
alternative endpoints uh

1259
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,200
cache this information for the next

1260
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,560
whatever

1261
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,760
and also this solution uh those headers

1262
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,720
you will not be able uh to update the

1263
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,160
configuration on the visitor browser uh

1264
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,480
unless your website is up

1265
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,839
right because you're not getting those

1266
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,160
headers as far as i understand

1267
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,720
uh your dns infrastructure needs to be

1268
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,640
open that's right your dns

1269
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,480
infrastructure needs to be open

1270
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,200
yeah yeah but uh what i've

1271
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,720
sorry yes you're right but what i've

1272
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,480
what i've seen is something called alt

1273
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,680
svc

1274
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,000
uh i can't remember what the acronym is

1275
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,560
for and that's an http header uh that

1276
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,280
specifies alternative endpoints kind of

1277
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
sort of sort of thing

1278
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,200
uh

1279
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
and and this could potentially be a

1280
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,680
solution like like this but again you

1281
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,839
would not be able to update the visitors

1282
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,720
uh

1283
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
config

1284
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,160
when your website is down right with

1285
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,240
with the dns i agree right but also with

1286
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
the dns if you're

1287
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,920
if your website is blocked then dns is

1288
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
probably blocked right and this doesn't

1289
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
rely on dns right because you've loaded

1290
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,280
the service worker the service worker

1291
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,040
has all the information it needs uh

1292
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,400
already right

1293
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
okay

1294
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,440
uh any more questions

1295
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,160
wow clearly a boring talk

1296
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,960
uh so there's another problem uh if one

1297
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,040
of the organizations in the circle gets

1298
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,119
compromised suddenly you have one

1299
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,440
organization that can push like militia

1300
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,359
malicious content

1301
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,079
to

1302
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,319
that gets hosted by everyone else no it

1303
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,319
cannot well it can cause it can push

1304
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,599
this content uh yes right but i would

1305
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,880
imagine that if you're running an

1306
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
organization that is part of this pool

1307
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,000
you would have a domain for your own

1308
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,920
stuff websites etc and you would have a

1309
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,520
separate domain

1310
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
uh for the for the alternate event point

1311
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,720
stuff right

1312
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,200
in this in this pool right so

1313
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,000
of course if i were running

1314
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,480
infrastructure of one of those

1315
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,079
organizations i would separate those

1316
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,319
things very well right because i don't

1317
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,680
know what's going to get pushed into

1318
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,400
this right but from the perspective of a

1319
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,720
of a website operator who's relying on

1320
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,000
those alternative endpoints the

1321
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,760
subresource integrity and signed

1322
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,359
integrity just solve this problem

1323
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
because if somebody pushes the

1324
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,920
you know modified malicious whatever

1325
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
code to their alternative endpoint that

1326
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,839
you're going to use

1327
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,160
it will they will not be able to sign

1328
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,880
the integrity package right so so

1329
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,400
the service workers just say oh that was

1330
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
some kind of a bug it doesn't matter

1331
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,560
yeah but there are some types of content

1332
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,200
that gets uh you can get a website down

1333
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,800
uh like uh police raid just uh by the

1334
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,240
presence of the fire oh yeah but but

1335
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,520
