3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,359

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,400

have started their badge

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
more or less the same

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
who didn't do anything with their badge

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
oh quite some

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,280
who

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
wants to do

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
something with their badge when they are

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
at home

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,840
wow

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
wow you're amazing

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
who has used something somebody else

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
wrote

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
wow you have quite a crowd are you ready

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,600
okay so you have the crowd for the badge

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
they are very interested to get more

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,839
about it have fun with the batch team

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
thank you

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
all right

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
um we're here with three now i hope the

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
others will join us before the end

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
because of course

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,119
we want to thank everyone

31
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,000
and

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
i would like to start with this little

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
throwback to the last

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
badge talk because

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,880
this over engineering is a way of life

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,680
yeah the last time this was the second

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
cost fallacy as a way of life

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
so

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,399
this may be an improvement

40
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,040
in this talk we would like to take you

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
in a little journey uh through well how

42
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
we came to be here with this device

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,640
um

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,879
a little bit of history on

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,840
well how did badges even come to be and

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
what was there before

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
what we managed to deliver

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
how we managed to deliver that and the

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
challenges on the way

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
some challenges we experienced

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
throughout the end of our journey

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
and also what does the future hold

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
because this is a pretty cool device but

54
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
i mean if the camp ends does the badge

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
adventure end

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,200
and finally some

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
some shout outs to cool things we saw

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
happen with the badge during camp

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
so

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,319
i think you all have this device

61
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
i don't see everyone wearing one

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,599
where are your badges

63
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,239
yeah okay it's raining that's a good

64
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,360
excuse

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
fair enough

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
but of course

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
this badge is not your ordinary

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
conference badge i mean i think you all

69
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
know

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
this

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
for example

72
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
everybody who's been to normal

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
conferences

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
would have seen something like this it

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
can be a credit sized car a credit card

76
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,400
sized badge or something else but it

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
always has

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
your name on it and maybe the company

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
you work for or the organization you're

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
attached to

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
and it gives people an introduction to

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
you

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
which lowers the threshold to talk to

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,599
you which is nice if you want to network

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,360
of course

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,319
but how did we get from there

87
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
to here

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,519
well actually

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
it may surprise you

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,760
because

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
of course there are a lot of differences

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
a lot more components we have batteries

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,959
and

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
lots of chips on it and

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
proto area

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,239
it all started here in 2006 at defcon

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,760
14.

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
this badge

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,639
it didn't it was as fancy as what we

100
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
know now for badges

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
but

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
defcon had badges

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
with distinctions between categories of

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
visitors i think some of you will know

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
and they wanted to reduce counterfeiting

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
of badges so they designed something

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
that was hard to copy at least in the

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
time span needed to to do so

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
so they made a badge with a little

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
microcontroller on it a button and two

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
leds that would blink in a pseudo random

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
pattern

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
and there were different versions for

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,840
visitors for vips for organization etc

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
and then the next year

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
it evolved to this it suddenly had a

117
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
display

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
and

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
this could display your own text it had

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
a couple of touch buttons um

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
these

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
are touch buttons

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,479
and had a battery that lasted long

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
enough to last a conference this was a

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,759
do-it-yourself matrix display consisting

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
of a couple of

127
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,280
smd leds

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
and so this was kind of the first batch

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
with with real display

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
then the year after suddenly it had

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,919
badge to batch communications and sd

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
card reader on the back

133
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
uh people were hoping for the first

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
batch to batch worms during this defcon

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,919
and then

136
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
two years later it jumped to europe as

137
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
far as we could figure out so don't pin

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
me on this but as far as we could figure

139
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
out this was the first

140
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
european event badge

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
electronic hackable event badge

142
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
it's a display you could play games on

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,639
it it had easter eggs it was hackable it

144
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
had badge to batch communications via

145
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,479
leds

146
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
so this this actually already looks a

147
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
lot like

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,560
what we know today as badges

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
then the fancy badge pandemic started a

150
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
lot more fun than the other pandemics

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
you may know of

152
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,680
first in 2011 i think we had the rocket

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
2012 tilde

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
from emf

155
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,360
the radio 2015 2016 we had this a new

156
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
version of tilde also from emf and then

157
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,600
2017

158
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,318
the xiao badge

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
and this was the first

160
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
event badge for this dutch series of

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,319
quadrennial hacker events

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
and we are really proud of it and also

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
set an example and the direction of

164
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,080
where we

165
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,599
apparently could go

166
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
because this badge uh of course it's a

167
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
it's a nice piece of kit it looks looks

168
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
good

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
it has a cool display which stays on if

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,880
the power goes out etc

171
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
this display made it very well readable

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,759
in direct sunlight so it was actually

173
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
very usable as a badge

174
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
um and it's it's

175
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
run adrenal micro python so the menus

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
and all apps uh they were written in

177
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
micropython

178
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,919
which means

179
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
it's really easy to make apps for it

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
this was also um amplified through the

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,919
hatchery which is which was created for

182
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,400
this badge they actually where you can

183
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
submit your own little python eggs or

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,919
apps

185
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
and share them with everyone else people

186
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,199
can download them on their badge by the

187
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
hatchery client on their badge

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
it has a serial ui which means you can

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,840
connect it to your computer

190
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
via usb and then program on it

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
via usb via the serial interface and

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
this makes it really easy to develop and

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
prototype whatever you want to make

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
so basically what what this badge did

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
was it brought app development and

196
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
micropython to the masses

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
which is pretty cool for something

198
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
that's only intended to you know show

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
your name

200
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
only intended quote unquote

201
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
so

202
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,759
then the question came around hacker

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
hotel 2020

204
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,639
what can we possibly do

205
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,800
that will be even cooler than

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
a micro python e-paper badge

207
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
well

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
we wanted to do something with fpga

209
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,080
development

210
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,880
[Applause]

211
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
because fpgas are

212
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,120
kind of like

213
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
magic smoke which you can manipulate

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,519
using bit streams

215
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
i won't go into the two technical

216
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
details right now but

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
if you can do stuff with fpgas that is a

218
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
really powerful tool in developing for

219
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,000
all kinds of devices and applications

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
we wanted it to be usable after the

221
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,399
event

222
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
because uh if you have a badge that is

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
that becomes e-waste after the event

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
that's not very sustainable

225
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
and also

226
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
well

227
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,279
why not make something that actually

228
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
lasts that you can use that that's fun

229
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
that adds value as for example a tool

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
for radio

231
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
applications or

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,399
visualization

233
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,959
that has educational value like teaching

234
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,040
teaching people micropython or fpga

235
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
development

236
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
and we also wanted to reuse and grow

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
this the chat 2017 ecosystem where you

238
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
can share your apps and let other people

239
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920
partake in all the fun things you make

240
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
so these were our goals as we set out to

241
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
create a new badge

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
and i would say we were pretty

243
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
successful

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
because we delivered a working badge at

245
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
the start of camp we didn't need to do

246
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
last minute soldering sweatshops or

247
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
flashing

248
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
more over 100 apps were created and

249
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
published at camp

250
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
and at least 1600 badges probably more

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
but the stats were reset somewhere

252
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
between yesterday and today

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,920
were actually activated and connected to

254
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
wifi at the event which is

255
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
half

256
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
that's pretty good for for an event

257
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
badge like this

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
and finally we were able to

259
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
introduce or at least give access to

260
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
fpga development to a lot of hackers

261
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
because all 3 200 visitors of this event

262
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
have received this device and even if

263
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
they decided to enjoy the camp and go to

264
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
talks and not fill with our badge

265
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,279
at camp

266
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,880
the tool chain

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
that has been built around this badge

268
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
and everything else will be available

269
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
after camp it will be improved after

270
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,600
camp so people can still use it and

271
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
learn from it and share it

272
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
when you go home in a day or a week

273
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
oh hi everyone of course we did last

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
minute things so i'm gonna try to do a

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,480
presentation here and no guarantees

276
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,079
so when we started this journey um

277
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,200
we had the shab edge uh we knew what why

278
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
we built that we saw the emf 2016

279
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
basically this is amazing we want one

280
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
too so we made a badge a nice square not

281
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,560
much artwork but functional with an

282
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,079
e-ink screen

283
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
that's also his biggest limitation

284
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,399
right you can't really play games on it

285
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,680
it's a bit slow

286
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
but people still made a lot of fun stuff

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for it so when we started prototyping

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,079
this new badge uh one of the first

289
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,600
things we did was we got rid of the ink

290
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
screen and went back to the screen that

291
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
emf used on their badge

292
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
color fast you can play games on this

293
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
we added

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
an fpga because

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
we want to introduce people to new

296
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
technical challenges

297
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
and we added an stm32

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
because we wanted the usb connects to be

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
more than just a serial connection we

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
wanted people to be able to use it from

301
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
a web browser via web usb use tools to

302
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
upload apps in an easy way

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
we partially succeeded doing that and

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,240
the hardware is there so uh

305
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
this is not what you got

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
you got a way more fancy badge right

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
it's not a square

308
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
because we are just engineers right we

309
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
know how to do cool hardware but we

310
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
don't know how to do

311
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
an actually cool badge so

312
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
we come to contact with tilde industries

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
thank you nicolette for doing an amazing

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
job

315
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
on

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
getting a an actual badge a piece of art

317
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
that you can wear with

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,040
pride it's

319
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
a long journey towards

320
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
actually getting a badge done as you can

321
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
see here we went to many design

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
iterations

323
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
and we almost settled on this one on the

324
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
left

325
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,639
and then we decided no we actually want

326
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
to be able to play games on it so we

327
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
made it into sort of game boy like thing

328
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
but still you can see the process of

329
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,279
going from a square to through many

330
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,639
iterations towards what you have

331
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
around your neck today

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
i also want to give a shout out to

333
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,279
people who

334
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
joined us virtually

335
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,639
we have

336
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
i hope i say this correctly

337
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
uri

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
who makes the vocv simulator he can

339
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,839
actually fully simulate an esp32 not not

340
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,680
just microphones and not just the upper

341
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
level things though you can fully

342
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
simulate

343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,440
uh an esp32 in the web browser using

344
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,639
javascript

345
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
and

346
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
for this event he made a virtual version

347
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
of the badge so people people could

348
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
experiment with it program for it even

349
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
before it has all started

350
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
awesome work

351
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
and i also want to give a shout out to

352
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
carlos who uh joined us a little bit

353
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600
later almost when the event just started

354
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
he showed up and said

355
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,480
i got a cool thing got ice studio

356
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,440
so

357
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
we tried to introduce people to fpgas

358
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,199
but then you have to install tool chains

359
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
and you have to do fiery log which is a

360
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
completely new language for most

361
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
this tool

362
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
which now has support for the mch 2022

363
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
badge allows you to drag and drop blocks

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
of logic and connect them in a graphical

365
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
way it's really cool be sure to check it

366
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,199
out

367
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
and and of course nothing's perfect i

368
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,040
mean the badges work so we got quite far

369
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
but a lot of you might have experienced

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
the red kite of death as we call it just

371
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,160
a badge that does nothing with a

372
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,279
blinking

373
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
red led

374
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
we actually managed to put the wrong

375
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
logo in the sponsor's wheel sorry let us

376
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,880
we fixed that in the ota update

377
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,839
and

378
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,600
we actually had some major problems with

379
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
the battery charging circuit

380
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,399
so

381
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
yeah let me explain what happened with

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
the red kite of death

383
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,120
um

384
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
apparently when you have crystals they

385
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
need load capacitors and those load

386
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
capacitors make sure they start up

387
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
correctly that they can get going

388
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
and um when you specify a bill of

389
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,160
materials for your chinese partners be

390
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
sure to specify what load capacitance

391
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
you need

392
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,199
um

393
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,560
i didn't

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
luckily i wasn't the only one we

395
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
actually found out that adafruit made

396
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,120
the same mistake

397
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
so

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
um they actually already patched this in

399
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,079
the sdk you put a little bit of extra

400
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,160
delay in the boot loader so before it

401
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
starts trying to access the flash chip

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
it it waits a while and that fixes

403
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,480
everything

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
so if any of you have intermittent

405
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
failures with the beds not starting the

406
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
kite turning red

407
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
please tell us come to the badge then

408
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,759
we'll also publish a file that you can

409
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,399
drag and drop onto a usb drive that

410
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,759
appears when you put the batch into

411
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,120
bootloader mode

412
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
that will also fix the problem for

413
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
people who will find out about this

414
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,758
after the event

415
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
yeah it's always in the details right

416
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
so again details

417
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
instead of using a an ideal diode which

418
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,519
prevents

419
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
current from flowing back into the

420
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,839
battery from your system bus

421
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,800
um

422
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
instead of making that fi with passive

423
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
components i thought well we can do this

424
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
more fancy we can get chips for that now

425
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,440
so i found this really cool chip

426
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,199
uh which on the front page of the

427
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
datasheet says oh it has reverse

428
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
blocking it doesn't let current through

429
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
in uh in the reverse direction

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
yeah problem is on page seven it

431
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,640
actually says only when the chip is

432
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
disabled

433
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
so make sure you check that we only

434
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,000
figured out that we actually were

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
putting five volts on the battery like a

436
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,880
couple of weeks before we started

437
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,310
production that's not nice

438
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,480
[Laughter]

439
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,119
and actually how did that happen well on

440
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,960
the prototypes we actually made sure to

441
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
disable this chip

442
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
and we put a little circuit in place

443
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
with a transistor that was turned on uh

444
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
when you plugged in usb

445
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
and key night people might spot the

446
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
mistake i made there i uh should have

447
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
put a 10k resistor

448
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
in

449
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
in series with the usb voltage so that

450
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
it actually acted as a voltage divider i

451
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
didn't and i only noticed this

452
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,280
afterwards of course

453
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
so yeah the result was some leakage

454
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
voltage from the diode could actually

455
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
cause the chip to turn off so your badge

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
would wouldn't work on battery

457
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,400
and yeah we figured this out thought

458
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
well okay it all seems fine when you

459
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
connect it

460
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,000
without this extra circuit so we just

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
removed it that's why you now no longer

462
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
have the bypass diode

463
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
because

464
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,039
well current can flow and reverse

465
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
through this chip

466
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
don't do what i did

467
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,440
so the one warning

468
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
that i give to all of you is don't touch

469
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,799
the battery chip if you've been charging

470
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,240
your badge for a while it gets quite hot

471
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,960
otherwise everything worked out

472
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
and

473
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
as you saw in our early design the

474
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
prototype we used an scm-32

475
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
and we used a some extra chips like i o

476
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,280
expanders and uh a fancy deck chip for

477
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
the um

478
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
for the audio

479
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,760
and none of those were available anymore

480
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,400
the chip shortage was of course a major

481
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
thing for every electronics designer and

482
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,240
luckily

483
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,039
we got most of the the more rare chips

484
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,799
the the microcontrollers the special

485
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,080
stuff the fpga from our sponsors so

486
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,600
a huge

487
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
thanks to those people who made sure we

488
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,039
actually got the parts

489
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
but yeah we couldn't get everything so

490
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
we had to do some last minute changes we

491
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
switched to the amazing rp 2040

492
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
processor by raspberry pi

493
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
so actually the co-processor that does

494
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
some board management things is actually

495
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,320
very powerful

496
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,200
and

497
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
i've heard some people

498
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
working on a way to actually get more

499
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
firmware into the flash of the rp2040 so

500
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
that you can do more than just code

501
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
processor work on it so uh look forward

502
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
to that

503
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
and i will now hand the microphone to

504
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,799
julian who's going to tell you about the

505
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,840
software challenges

506
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
yes thank you

507
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,080
there is

508
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,919
a lot of software that had to be made to

509
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,440
make this badge possible of course

510
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,159
among which is graphics because i just

511
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,640
wasn't satisfied with what we had so oh

512
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
you know just casually rewrite the

513
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,039
entire thing in a year no big

514
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
so

515
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
there are there's a new graphics library

516
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
which is

517
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,360
i hope people find it cool and not

518
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,480
confusing

519
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,159
i tried to make it not

520
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,280
uh the

521
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
drivers for various bits of hardware

522
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,799
were actually um

523
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,159
mostly

524
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
rewritten as well because there did

525
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
exist uh drivers but most of them were

526
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,799
proprietary blob form

527
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,919
and we didn't like that very much

528
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
so

529
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
one of the drivers i think it was the

530
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,280
bno sensor was like only a few weeks

531
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
before camp actually a fully working

532
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,640
driver

533
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,760
and i was watching that and i was going

534
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
like oh no this sensor isn't going to be

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,919
usable

536
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
um

537
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,799
the native apps which are running

538
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,679
on the esp32 i think actually turned out

539
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
really great

540
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
someone called

541
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
sprite dm

542
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,799
made the pocket sprite

543
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,520
little game boy sized thing

544
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
which

545
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
had esp32 multi-boot

546
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,760
and it didn't really look like it

547
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
but um

548
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,360
i don't know who that was it wasn't you

549
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,039
someone here

550
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,159
probably renzo was like esp32 multi-boot

551
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
we need that um

552
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
so we got in contact with spy tm and

553
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,039
adapted uh his code

554
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,799
there were some fixes

555
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
uh turn it into a component so now

556
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
anyone that wants to

557
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,559
multi-boot on an esp32 can import

558
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
the app fs components

559
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,799
and just

560
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,919
boot multiple firmwares from one esp

561
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,960
there were also some software fixed

562
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
hardware problems happening but those

563
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
aren't

564
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,520
too interesting

565
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,880
there was a software bug in esp-idfv3

566
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,559
which is what

567
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
the sha badge used to run

568
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
which basically made sbi completely

569
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
useless

570
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
now we haven't gone into detail about

571
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
the design just yet

572
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,840
but the fpga is connected to the

573
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,760
esp32 with spi

574
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
which means that the only way to use it

575
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
if is if

576
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
spi actually works properly

577
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,760
and that meant

578
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
porting

579
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,720
all of micro python from esp-idf version

580
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,320
3 to esp-idf version 4.

581
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
i still don't know how they managed to

582
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
do it but it worked out in the end

583
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
uh yes

584
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
all right so now you know how we got

585
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960
here uh or at least

586
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
the

587
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,720
the red the red line

588
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,400
how did we get here

589
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,559
and now this question where do we go

590
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,080
from here because

591
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
as i said before

592
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
you don't want your badge to be trash

593
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
after the event

594
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,679
so first of all um

595
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,480
our our web development team

596
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
have already been working on a new

597
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,480
version of the hatchery with an improved

598
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
ui and

599
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
improved architecture overall

600
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,720
and the goal i mean i'm not promising

601
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
that this is what it's going to look

602
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,520
like

603
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,400
but our goal is to make the hatchery an

604
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,880
online ide for your badge so you plug in

605
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
your badge you can type your code in

606
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,279
your browser run it on your badge and

607
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
upload to the hatchery all from the same

608
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,559
environment

609
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,799
this would of course make it really easy

610
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,360
to experiment to try new things

611
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
and most of all

612
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
to just have fun and

613
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
get an entry into this role of app

614
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,520
development

615
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
because if you don't need 10 different

616
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
tools and you don't need to install all

617
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
kinds of tool chains and programs to

618
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
actually build stuff for your badge and

619
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,559
you can just do it from your browser

620
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,600
which is enabled by web usb

621
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,120
then of course more people are going to

622
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,239
do it which is what we want

623
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
and then the same goes for the fpga

624
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,000
carlos

625
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,679
who has been working like a madman for

626
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,400
the last weeks to get us examples and

627
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
native support for the badge

628
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
in the software practice eye studio is

629
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
still working on more examples

630
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
with also with support for the display

631
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
to enable people to just drag and drop

632
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,679
their logic and to explore

633
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,400
what the potential of fpga of an fpga

634
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,600
actually is

635
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,840
because

636
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,520
this program allows you to drag and drop

637
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,600
but also to view the verilog that it

638
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
produces

639
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,159
and

640
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
to edit that

641
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,039
so

642
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
it's both compatible with total

643
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
beginners

644
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
and with more advanced users who know

645
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,279
verilog and who want to expand the

646
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,919
functionality of existing blocks or of

647
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,559
their designs

648
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
and then there's also a human factor

649
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
very important because

650
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,559
this is a project we all do for fun

651
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,559
um

652
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,400
it's very it has turned out it's very

653
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,480
important to set clear expectations

654
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
because

655
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,039
well we all do it for fun but

656
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,799
what you can do for fun how far that

657
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,240
drives you

658
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
that differs very much from person to

659
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,760
person

660
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
and this has caused earlier projects

661
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
people burning out or

662
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
not sleeping the nights before the event

663
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,400
because stuff had to be done last minute

664
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
or

665
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
people rage quitting because

666
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
things didn't go as smoothly as we would

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
have wanted and this project

668
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
again wasn't perfect

669
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,480
but we think it's really important to

670
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,840
stress that

671
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
it's not only technical

672
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,559
skills you need to function in a team

673
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
like this because of course we want to

674
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
we want to build cool stuff but we also

675
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
want to have fun we want to keep

676
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
everybody happy

677
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
and we want

678
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,600
all team members to be able to enjoy the

679
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,678
result and not be hindered by

680
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
well things that weren't as they

681
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
expected

682
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,760
then of course with clear expectations

683
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,919
also comes clear communication um

684
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
i guess that's logical

685
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,919
having a roomy planning i can really

686
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,559
advise this this project ran

687
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,919
from

688
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,799
about february of 2020

689
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,679
until today and it's still running so we

690
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,520
had two and a half years to develop this

691
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,559
badge

692
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
and still

693
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
some things like the web development

694
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,640
part had to happen last minute

695
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,520
so

696
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,159
if you want to have badge in three years

697
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,200
please start now

698
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
because if you have a roomy planning

699
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,679
then there is space to to reinvent to

700
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,720
really

701
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
let everybody contribute and if you want

702
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,200
to cram everything into a year of work

703
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,799
then the scope of people who will be

704
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
available to help with that level of

705
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
dedication will be really limited of

706
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
course

707
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
and finally keep the vibes positive

708
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
because

709
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,279
if people are having fun they will do

710
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,720
they will go to great lengths to

711
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,840
contribute

712
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,880
um

713
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,039
i mean we had a couple of people swoop

714
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,080
in

715
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,279
at the last minute to help us with

716
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,039
documentation and preparing workshops we

717
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,559
had a guy from spain

718
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
join us online because he wanted to

719
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,679
add native support for our project to

720
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
his software package and it all happens

721
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
because we are all enthusiastic about

722
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,520
what we're doing because

723
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
we have made something cool and we want

724
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
to share it and we want to help other

725
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,640
people also

726
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
if possible profit from that success

727
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
because we are hoping to give i studio a

728
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,880
kick into

729
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
you know popularity

730
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,360
by having it

731
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,600
work with our badge and also we want

732
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
it's it's a double-sided uh win-win

733
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
situation

734
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,879
then

735
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,559
okay well fun i can do this section i

736
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,840
didn't know that

737
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
we we saw a lot of awesome stuff

738
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
happening at on the field

739
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,399
you saw people with

740
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,720
extra big antennas because of course you

741
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,880
need good wi-fi reception

742
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,799
he saw someone with a

743
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,480
co2 sensor like a big external um

744
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,399
co2 sensor connected to the p-mod

745
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
connector of the fpga we just casually

746
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
said yeah i made a big stream that like

747
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,200
converts from a uart to spi so you can

748
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,080
read it on the esp32 like okay

749
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,919
awesome

750
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,679
a great job there

751
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,919
people made a case for the badge

752
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,320
and there was a knob for the joystick

753
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,240
really cool makes your badge look way

754
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
more fancy i highly recommend you search

755
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,200
for this

756
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,360
case and uh the joystick knob and

757
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
everything on thingiverse or wherever

758
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,640
people publish things nowadays um

759
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
you'll find it

760
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
and um

761
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
i also want to give a shout out to a

762
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,039
really cool talk that we uh we saw

763
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,279
about fault injection look that one up

764
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
if you weren't there it's probably

765
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
streamed online as well

766
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
they used our badge as a target for

767
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,799
fault injection and uh specifically

768
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,559
they got really cool results with the

769
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
fpga mandelbrot app

770
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
so normally you can like zoom in on

771
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
very cool repeating patterns

772
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
and by

773
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,360
applying electromagnetic pulses to the

774
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
right places on the back of the badge

775
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,720
they actually got completely random

776
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
structures out of it so that's really

777
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
cool and the app still worked so you

778
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
could browse through these completely

779
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,080
random

780
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,919
randomly generated

781
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,320
well things

782
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,000
yeah and i actually have no idea what

783
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,200
genu taylor is so rene

784
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
yeah so this is a project that was

785
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,039
brought to our attention i think

786
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,039
yesterday

787
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
um someone

788
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,440
built support for

789
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,919
uh juno gnu

790
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
dollar i'm not sure how to pronounce it

791
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,600
payments which are device 2 device

792
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,760
payments over nfc

793
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,720
um

794
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,600
this is a as far as you know

795
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
a payment system that allows people to

796
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,440
pay anonymously but not untraceably

797
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
and

798
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,360
this could mean

799
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
i mean i'm not doing and making any

800
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
promises

801
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,799
but it could mean that in the future we

802
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,840
might see

803
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,320
for example support for badge-to-badge

804
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
payments

805
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,120
via nfc because this is an open source

806
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240
project

807
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,399
and of course it would be fun

808
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
if you could securely

809
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,840
and safely

810
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,600
give people money if you think their

811
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
work is cool or if you think their app

812
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
is cool

813
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,559
without anything outside of your badge

814
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,840
we just thought that was a cool project

815
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
no guarantees

816
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,440
no guarantees

817
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,720
so

818
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,440
this was our last slide

819
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
and before we go to the q a i would just

820
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,159
like to thank everybody who contributed

821
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,720

i am not going to

823
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,960

824
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,000

29 people strong

837
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,880

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
yes thank you first

857
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
for giving us the talk and for working

858
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,200
on this

859
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
device so long and for

860
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,159
giving it to us or to play around with

861
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,760
yes other questions if you have

862
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,960
questions please go to the microphones

863
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
first question please

864
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
hello so

865
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,679
i've really enjoyed

866
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,919
tinkering around with the bats

867
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,159
and i was wondering

868
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,000
how did the process go from the share

869
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,640
2017 batch team to the current team

870
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,279
what kind of handover was there

871
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,480
how did the exchange of ideas go

872
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,080
can you explain something about it

873
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
thanks for the one question i hope we

874
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
wouldn't get but

875
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,359
i want to give a shout out to sebastian

876
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,639
who did an amazing job managing the team

877
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,359
and uh i really hope we're gonna do a

878
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
clip math or a beer together soon but

879
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,800
lots of things happen there and um

880
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
well some things we're not proud of but

881
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
the end result is here

882
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
thanks

883
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,918
yeah this is exactly why we included the

884
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,159
human factor into the presentation

885
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,199
because

886
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,359
this team has had a lot of adventures

887
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,079
and uh for some people it meant at some

888
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,520
point they didn't want to

889
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,879
be here anymore

890
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,440
uh in the team

891
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
and we want to improve on that and we

892
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,440
have had some changes in the team and we

893
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,079
are

894
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,440
keeping

895
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,280
looking forward trying to improve our

896
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,119
vibes trying to improve the way we work

897
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,160
together

898
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,839
because as the complexity of these

899
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,520
badges go up

900
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,599
the need for professionalism and also

901
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,400
for

902
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,960
keeping it all together and fun

903
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,359
is growing so

904
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,119
um

905
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,640
yeah it is it's

906
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
it's kind of a separate adventure from

907
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,480
the technical stuff and it also means

908
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
that the team is very fluid so every

909
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,839
event has its own team

910
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,460
does anyone have a like a bug zapper

911
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,760
[Music]

912
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,119
um

913
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,079
but yeah it's i i think for this event

914
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,119
um

915
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,680
development went a lot more smoothly in

916
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,320
terms of uh well hr

917
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
compared to previous events

918
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,960
thank you for this answer

919
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,760
next question please

920
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,160
information for follow-up

921
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,440
at multiboot i heard something like

922
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
application

923
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,400
file system

924
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,839
is that correct

925
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,119
so with afs i will find more information

926
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,520
on it

927
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,119
if you look at that github there is a

928
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,040
repository called esp component ffs

929
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
that contains everything you need

930
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,480
including a little instruction on how to

931
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,720
apply the change to the bootloader in

932
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,640
your project

933
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,720
and it should allow you to load files

934
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,040
into a special file system

935
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
that automatically aligns all the

936
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,839
firmwares correctly

937
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,160
and you can then call a

938
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,240
function to tell the bootloader to boot

939
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
into that firmware

940
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,119
this was all written by yaroon sprite

941
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,680
well most people you probably know

942
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
he made the pocket sprite

943
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,599
we just made sure it works on the latest

944
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,359
development environment

945
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
so

946
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,160
thanks

947
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,759
thank you next question please

948
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,440
fpgas were famously sort of closed

949
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,079
environments until the

950
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,160
lattice chip got basically reverse

951
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
engineered as far as i know lettuce has

952
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,880
never sort of publicly

953
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
even acknowledged the existence of this

954
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
whole open tool chain

955
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,560
do you have any experience with people

956
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,400
from lattice about what they think about

957
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,119
the the whole process

958
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,280
no

959
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,640
well i don't know the details but they

960
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,480
seem to be a little bit divided even

961
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,040
inside the company and the badge is also

962
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
fully compatible with their proprietary

963
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
tools which will probably result in more

964
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,079
compact designs and

965
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,280
faster routing or something but

966
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,800
we had a lot of fun with the open source

967
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,040
stuff on this because well we're hackers

968
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
right

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
and also

970
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
um i'm not going to name names because i

971
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
don't want these people to be flooded

972
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
with requests but we had some help

973
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,599
getting lettuce to sponsor us for this

974
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,560
badge

975
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,240
by someone who already had good contact

976
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
with them and was collaborating

977
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
collaborating with them on multiple

978
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,078
projects so

979
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,599
shout out to this amazing person i'm

980
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,520
sure you know who you are

981
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,560
if you're if you're hearing this

982
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
next question please

983
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
hi

984
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
do you have any plans to backboard some

985
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,440
features to the shower badge for example

986
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
the appffs

987
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,919
yes

988
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,760
we are looking to improve backwards

989
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,320
compatibility with the sha badge

990
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
for this event we focused on getting

991
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,400
everything to work in the first place

992
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
and but yeah we do have plans to make

993
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,440
sure as many apps as possible from the

994
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
shabbat will also work on this patch but

995
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
of course there's different peripherals

996
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,760
different display stack

997
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,400
so

998
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
we can't guarantee everything will work

999
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
but we are doing our best

1000
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,079
thank you

1001
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,839
thank you we have

1002
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,400
at least two more questions so

1003
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,880
does that also mean that if i

1004
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,920
spent a lot of time in making the next

1005
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,720
killer batch app that

1006
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,880
there is a high probability that it also

1007
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,920
will work on the next patch

1008
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,040
there's no way we can guarantee that but

1009
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
i mean when we asked espressif hey

1010
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
espressif would you like to sponsor us

1011
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
we couldn't even finish the sentence and

1012
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,560
they already sent over boxes of chips so

1013
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
i really hope they'll sponsor us again

1014
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,240
if they do and yes

1015
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
next question please

1016
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,400
hi i'm i'm a bad person i use windows

1017
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,040
and closed software

1018
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,359
so i can confirm that the the lattice

1019
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,680
radiant works on on the back so you can

1020
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,160
use the closed uh toolset

1021
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,760
um also as a bad person i connected my

1022
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
badge to my windows machine and i got a

1023
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
nice pop-up saying oh microsoft edge

1024
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
detected a batch here's where you can

1025
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,359
get the documentation what was that

1026
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,980
a lot of pain

1027
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,680
[Laughter]

1028
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,150
[Music]

[Applause]

1032
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,160
go for it you didn't show the fancy hdmi

1033
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,480
stuff

1034
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,319
um

1035
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,720
i blame it on the guy who planned the

1036
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,440
preparation for this talk

1037
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,839
which is me

1038
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,680
we tried to just have a lot of fun at

1039
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
camp we wanted to prepare the batch dog

1040
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,920
and show some slides from the badge

1041
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,240
but hey

1042
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,280
i mean

1043
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,760
didn't this work

1044
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
yeah okay so uh it's a good point he's

1045
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,000
mentioning it um using the fpga

1046
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
someone here i think it was sylvain

1047
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,359
right

1048
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,319
made in made a bit big stream which

1049
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,720
allows us to duplicate the display on

1050
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,480
the badge to an hdmi output using a pmod

1051
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,760
module

1052
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
so

1053
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
we would have been able to show some

1054
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,720
slides from the badge on this screen and

1055
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
of course it's useful it's useful for

1056
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,640
demos for anything you would like to do

1057

of interest and it's okay if you don't

1077
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,359
want to tell me but what's the cost

1078
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,720
price of one badge

1079
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,319
ball parking

1080
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,560
uh with with or without sponsored

1081
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,720
components

1082
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
oh that's a good question

1083
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,839
let's say without if i would want to

1084
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,880
make this

1085
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
just

1086
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,240
i think without sponsored components we

1087
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,200
would land at around uh

1088
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,720
18 to 20 euros a piece

1089
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,440
i think it's more like 20 years after

1090
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,000
sponsoring it's you're holding a 50-year

1091
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,520
device in your hands here and it's just

1092
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
cost price there's a lot of really cool

1093
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,560
