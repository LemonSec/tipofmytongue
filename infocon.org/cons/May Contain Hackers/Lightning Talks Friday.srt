00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,039
hello my name is sebastian i'm a

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
developer here in in taller i've been

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
working here for like two years ago i

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,600
wanted to show you something that i

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
built

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,320
for a talk

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,359
um

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,960
you might know tyler because he's

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
already been presented here in in this

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
kind of event so

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
but if you don't

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
you want to remember that there is an

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,239
exchange

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
uh that where we can withdraw money with

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
our wallet that we can install in um

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
as a web extension

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
or as a mobile and mobile software here

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,360
in android

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
and we can use the wallet to withdraw

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
money and pay to oh to our merchants

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
that has

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,079
back office installed and the merchant

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
can do the deposit of the money and

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
the feature the most nice feature that i

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
have is it is completely private uh i

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
have privacy for the one who uses the

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,439
wallet so

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
no leaving the exchange or the merchant

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,360
can um

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
stop the people for using the money

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,559
um

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
it is not a uses

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
it is not built using cryptocurrency

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
it's a digital

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
payment system that is used token token

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,159
based

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
payment

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
and what i built here is a device that

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
uses a cash validator

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
uh convert the the

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
signal to your usb serial

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
and there is a server that

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
listen to to this information

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,880
so

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
whenever i

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
go send money to here it will say okay

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,560
you have 20 dollars or 20 euros to pick

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
up

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and then we can scan it using our

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
web extension or using the mobile device

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,119
to

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,920
fill up the our wallet with the money

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,399
essentially where we are trying to do

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,720
here is like when you go to buy some

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
coins to play in an arcade machine so

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
after having the money in the wallet

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
i can scan another qr code that will

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
talk to the payment listener

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
and you will send the information to the

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,160
arcade machine

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,120
and to play the game

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
so

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,959
we can have this

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
let me for example show you this is the

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
arcade tyler pickup

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
there is no money yet

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
i'll start it again so if i reload there

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
is no money and then i'm going to insert

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
here

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
some money

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,959
it is validating the cash so if i send

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
some dollars here it won't read it i'm

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,879
going to going back

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
so now the server has

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,920
20 bucks

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,159
if i go to this page you

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,480
it will redirect me to collect the the

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
tip

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
and i going i when i open the wallet you

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,159
see there it has detected that is this

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
page has a

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,560
taller

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
tipping protocol

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,760
so when i open the page

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
the wallet will get the information

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,879
and i will be able to accept uh the

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
tipping from the merchant

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
right now i don't have any balance but

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
when i set the tip here

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,440
you will see

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,879
my my money in the wallet

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,840
after

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
picking up the money the there is no

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
more money here in the server and then i

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
can go to pay

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
um

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
i can go to pay

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
on a machine i can

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,400
scan a qr code or go to the url i'm

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
going to show you here through the web

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
extension i'm going to the archive okay

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
teller pay going to show me another qr

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,238
code to make the payment and when i

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
use my wallet to pay

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,279
it will represent all the information to

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,280
repay as you can see it's really fast

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
and after paying

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
it should be running

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
i forgot to to run the notification

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,359
then start the game

112
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,680
so well what i have here is a

113
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
little validator that is

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
always watching the

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
the money pick it up from the

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
from the machine and then another

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
service

118
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
here that is

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
checking the merchant again

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
where

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
the payment is made

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
and after

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
the found a complete payment it runs the

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
game

125
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,320
so

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
that's it that's the talk

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,960
hope you like

128
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
does anyone have any questions

129
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
at all so i've got one so for

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
with security in the system yeah

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
with the qr codes is there any

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
extra security on top of that or do you

133
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
have a password to access the wallet or

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
no the idea here is that

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880
the exchange is the one who holds

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,759
assets or holds the money and is the one

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
who's printing the

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
the coins to the wallet so when the

139
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
wallet go to the exchange asks for the

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
money the

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
the money is already saved

142
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
into the wallet in the world extension

143
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,720
or in my phone

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
so it's like it's more like cash it's

145
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
not that you have an account somewhere

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
and you need your password or your

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
account to to save your money there so

148
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
if your phone died would you yes exactly

149
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
you you have a gap that's why you have

150
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,759
this feature here to the back of of your

151
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,120
wallet

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,199
and yes definitely if you lost your

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
money in the real world you also lose

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
your

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
if you lose your wallet in your material

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
you also lost your money so and you you

157
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
gave the example of an arcade has it

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
been used in that scenario or what

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
scenarios has it really been used well

160
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,919
this is recently built just like two

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
weeks ago so

162
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
but that's the idea that's the idea you

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
can use it and

164
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,520
in the arcade system and as you saw is

165
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,199
really

166
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
fast so there is no

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
long transaction delayed or long

168
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,440
transaction cost because it's a service

169
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
running in a server and nothing tomorrow

170
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,440
there is no proof of work or performance

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
what made you design the system what was

172
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
your thinking when you

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,639
invented it

174
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
what i was saying thinking using

175
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
like this like fast pace what made you

176
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,319
come up with it just the speed was that

177
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
the idea yeah that's just the

178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
demonstration

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
okay all right

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
sorry anyone else got any questions or

181
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,560
anything

182
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
it's um was there a follow-on part for

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
the talk

184
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
so part two

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
it's um this is

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
you're both on the same project is that

187
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
right no not well yes also but not this

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
time oh okay

189
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
it's your friends you know each other

190
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,840
yes oh okay fine cool

191
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,479
sorry

192
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,400
thanks so we'll just do quick changeover

193
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
i meant to ask actually those money

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
detection machines can you hack those

195
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
are there ways to get around those

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
whether you've got 20 years and you

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,479
haven't well how do they work actually

198
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,919
what how do those actually work

199
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,360
detecting the money

200
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
well this because um the cash machines

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
yes

202
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,039
we'll pass on to christian to tell us

203
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,399
tell us more on the same related

204
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,719
subjects so take it away thanks

205
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,000
well

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
oh well wait for this week can we turn

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,839
the microphone on the back

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
of the front

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
okay

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
um well the last question we had was

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
okay what if you lose your wallet and

212
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
his answer was you have a backup right

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
um and then the next question is well if

214
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
you have a backup how do you encrypt

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,839
your backup

216
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
right

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
and then the next question is okay

218
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
encrypt your backup with a key and what

219
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
if you lose your key

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
right that's my talk

221
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
so

222
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
and i'm going to give you a

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
demonstration of gnu anastasis

224
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,839
which is a

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
well rather new new package

226
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
and so this is the idea you start by

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
you know

228
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
identifying yourself and before you can

229
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
identify yourself you have to tell me

230
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
who you are where you live because we're

231
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
going to ask yourself a bunch of very

232
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
personal questions because this is a

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
privacy project

234
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
i know i know it doesn't make sense

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
right well the personal information we

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
ask you for is going to stay on your

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
computer and we want to use this to

238
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
derive an identity and encrypt

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
information with it

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
not the main information but some

241
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,760
information now for this demonstration

242
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
i'm going to live in test land

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,959
and

244
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
well well whatever my my name is going

245
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
to be max or something like that

246
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
um and in test land uh well usually we

247
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
would ask for your social security

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,959
number your tax payer identification

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,040
number stuff like that in test land

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,600
we're going to ask for your prime number

251
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
two because it's an odd one

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
and your square number right pick one is

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,279
that okay

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
so again think of this being high

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
entropy information that not everybody

256
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,959
has because we kind of have two

257
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
adversary models one that knows stuff

258
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
about you and one who doesn't and the

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
adversary who doesn't know all of this

260
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
information about you has no chance of

261
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,560
getting anything

262
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,839
anyway

263
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
so the next step

264
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,680
is making sure okay we don't forget this

265
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
um i am sure

266
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,760
is to configure authentication methods

267
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
and so you can pick the usual one send

268
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
me an sms with the pin code send me an

269
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
email

270
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,079
use totp

271
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,680
is this your phone

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
does it have to dp or just on it i can't

273
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
unlock it anyway he trusts me very well

274
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,479
he left his phone

275
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
and you can also send physical mail but

276
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
i'm going to stick to security questions

277
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
simply because

278
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
the rest is a bit more involved and i'm

279
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,959
going to have very simple security

280
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
questions here you know first question

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,240
first answer don't use those

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
now the system requires me to put in

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
multiple factors for authentication but

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
i can do the same ones multiple times so

285
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
i'm going to be again very creative q2

286
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
a2

287
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,600
right

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
and maybe do a third one for good

289
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,279
measure um

290
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,399
yeah i really can't type with this

291
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,600
microphone in my hand so i'm going to

292
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
keep it very short

293
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
okay three top security questions i

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
recommend highly

295
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
the next thing is you the system will

296
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
distribute your key shares across

297
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
multiple providers and now here you can

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
kind of configure your recovery policy

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
so by default if you have put in three

300
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
it suggests two out of three but you can

301
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,200
also say no i want all three or one out

302
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
of three and you can also specify at

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
which providers they're going to be

304
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
stored in this case the providers i've

305
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
got running for the demonstration

306
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,519
purposes are the data loss in

307
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
corporations

308
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
again in practice we have actual

309
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
providers that run this system

310
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,040
in various locations in various

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
jurisdictions

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,079
i'm happy with this default policy for

313
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
now now i can name my secret

314
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
whatever mch

315
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
what is the good secret for mch i don't

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,839
know 2022 not very creative okay

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,720
and

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,680
now i've made my backup

319
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,399
and again the different companies have

320
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
stored different shares of the secret

321
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
right none of them has access to

322
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,399
everything and they're additionally

323
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
encrypted with information derived by my

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,360
identity which also serves like an

325
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
account identifier

326
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,800
now if i come if i go and say i've

327
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,959
forgotten what year it is

328
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,360
i can recover the secret

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
again i have to say where i am

330
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
because i didn't restart the application

331
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
just remembered at least this form

332
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
otherwise you have to re-enter it of

333
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
course

334
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,720
now you can get a list of all the things

335
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
you've backed up at all of these

336
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,839
providers it basically went already in

337
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
the background and asked all these

338
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
providers hey do you have backups for

339
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,399
this user identity

340
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
right i can pick based on the secret

341
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
name only have one here which one to

342
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
recover

343
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
now i have to solve the security puzzles

344
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
and basically tells me we've got three

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,000
policies solve one of them so for

346
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,519
example i could say okay i can solve

347
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,480
this one

348
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
a1

349
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
and now i've solved parts for these two

350
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
policies

351
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
or i could solve q3

352
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
a2

353
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
oh that was wrong right

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
now if i do this too many times it

355
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
actually locks me out

356
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
correct answer was a3

357
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,839
and it has reassembled the secret 2022

358
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
so

359
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,839
multi-party backup the providers learn

360
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
very little

361
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,360
effectively only actually things like

362
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,560
your email address your sms number

363
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
during recovery with free software

364
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,000
available from gnu

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,560
thank you

366
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,040
[Applause]

367
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,079
hey does anyone have any questions there

368
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,120
so

369
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,720
oh yes we do have some so right

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
so for others that work with like phones

371
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
and

372
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,480
mail recovery is it like

373
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
external party

374
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,199
from phone and

375
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
an email and maybe

376
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
snail mail is there an

377
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
external party that

378
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,240
you need to rely on yeah all of the the

379
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
key shares are always stored at a

380
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
provider and that provider will send you

381
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,279
the email or the sms

382
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
we also have another method implemented

383
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
where you have to send me money that's

384
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
the business model you authenticate by

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
being able to send from your bank

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,519
account to me one euro then i believe

387
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
it's you with the right wire subject but

388
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
of course you rely on email providers or

389
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,320
phone system right

390
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
but in the case of security question or

391
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,040
t otp of course not really

392
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
what kind of encryption

393
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
is used at these data providers

394
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
uh there's multiple layers of symmetric

395
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,880
encryption

396
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
uh the first one is basically use your

397
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
user identity to encrypt both uh the in

398
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
the key share

399
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,639
that that you have

400
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
which again is itself used to

401
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
be encrypt part of the key that is

402
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
actually the secrets actually stored um

403
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
then we have another layer around it

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
which encrypts the authentication

405
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,040
information so that that only becomes

406
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,399
available during recovery for the

407
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,959
provider but it's mostly aes gcm

408
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,720
encryption symmetric encryption

409
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,399
we use of course uh

410
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
uh i think that's the script so pbkdf

411
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
hash function make it more expensive and

412
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
we hash the user attributes

413
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
but there's no asymmetric encryption

414
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
required here the only asymmetric part

415
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
is we sign

416
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
the uploads so if you upload multiple

417
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
secrets we know it's coming from the

418
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,599
right account so to speak

419
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
somebody did that answer your question

420
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
do each of these data providers have the

421
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
same data no they all have completely

422
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
different data each provider has a

423
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
public salt and so we even make sure

424
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
that when we identify identify the

425
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,519
account the accounts look different at

426
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,040
the different providers and they have

427
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
different key shares so of course also

428
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
the things that they're storing is

429
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
completely different but they can't even

430
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
say that tell that they're serving

431
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,199
serving the same user except if they

432
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
lock ip addresses and say oh it's the

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,759
same guy who's coming from the same

434
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,160
address

435
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
i have a question too

436
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
could you technically design the

437
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,160
encryption in a way so that the password

438
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
is never known by the provider and just

439
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,759
you use the answer as the decryption key

440
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
and if the output has the right format

441
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,959
then

442
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,560
technically the provider would never

443
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
have to know the answer he doesn't so

444
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
what we we do all of this so the the in

445
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
fact the password is hashed in two ways

446
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,759
one is used to also decrypt the

447
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,079
decryption key locally so and the

448
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,600
provider doesn't learn that and the

449
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
other one is the password is hashed with

450
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
a strong salt so it's against brute

451
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,519
forcing and then that

452
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,279
hash with a strong salt hash is sent to

453
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,120
the provider so the provider never

454
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
learns the actual passphrase but a good

455
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
question

456
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,279
i actually have a question that goes in

457
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,519
the same direction is there just simply

458
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
a white paper detailing all that linked

459
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
there is a bachelor's thesis detailing

460
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,240
all of that which won the information

461
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
security society award of switzerland in

462
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,959
2021

463
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,480
so bachelor's thesis not a white paper

464
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
okay thank you and how you defined it

465
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
uh you would find the bachelor thesis in

466
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
the git repository

467
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,359
and on anastasis.lu

468
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
it should be linked somewhere

469
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,000
okay hopefully i find it thanks

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,559
so cool okay do somebody have a question

471
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,919
on this side

472
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
or is that being answered oh yes here we

473
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,080
are

474
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
so currently you have about six

475
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
providers where to store information or

476
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
currently we have

477
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
three providers in operation

478
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
a fourth provider is in the i'm setting

479
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
it up but taking some time

480
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,720
we have six different authentication

481
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
methods implemented

482
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
five of which are operation the sixth

483
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
one is waiting for the bank to give us

484
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
the account details so we can actually

485
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
do the bank authentication it works in a

486
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
test setup but not in production yet the

487
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
six authentication method but we have

488
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
currently three providers

489
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,039
if you're interested in running another

490
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,840
one please contact me

491
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,799
what about a blockchain like bitcoin

492
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,840
what

493
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,960
a blockchain why would you need a

494
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
blockchain for this well it's all about

495
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
storing data somewhere right and

496
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
no because you don't want the data to be

497
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
necessarily public now in our case if

498
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,799
the provider were compromising the

499
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
provider's database finds itself on the

500
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
internet you're still luck because he's

501
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
only having key shares right and it's

502
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
additionally encrypted but you still

503
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
don't want this data to be public

504
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
because if i compromise enough providers

505
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
which hopefully is difficult enough

506
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
because enough of them and there are

507
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
around the planet and maybe they don't

508
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
know everything about me but basically i

509
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
can bypass the authentication if i

510
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,840
compromise the provider so this data

511
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,280
should not be public that's sort of the

512
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,799
providers

513
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,440
so so you are dependent on the provider

514
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,640
adhering to some form of security

515
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
we are adhering to a sufficient subset

516
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,039
of the providers being both available

517
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
and not disclosing the information

518
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,960
and

519
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
against a strong adversary who knows

520
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
your name your social security number

521
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,600
and the other information on the first

522
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,799
screen

523
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
clear thank you

524
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,280
so if if a few providers fail is there a

525
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
risk that the system loses your

526
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,559
passwords

527
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,080
uh well the system doesn't have your

528
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
password so you can't lose your

529
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
passwords but it might lose your stored

530
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,000
secrets uh if but it depends on your

531
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
policy right if you decided any one of

532
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
the providers is enough then only one

533
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,760
provider needs to survive if you said

534
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
i've distributed to three providers and

535
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
i need information from all three then

536
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
one of them failing and you're done but

537
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,840
it's freely configurable

538
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
actually i think i just answered my

539
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
question i was going to ask if it made

540
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
any sense to have a have anything air

541
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
gapped at the providers but i guess the

542
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,080
answer is no they can just use a data

543
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
diode or something internally

544
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
yeah i think as a provider you probably

545
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
want to also serve the customers when

546
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,159
they are really in urgent need for the

547
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,600
data quickly and that's i don't think

548
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
there's a gap need here no

549
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,679
i i noticed there was an expiry date on

550
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,799
some of the

551
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,520
secrets why would you want that

552
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,840
uh there's an expiry date mostly because

553
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
the providers might not want to commit

554
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
to storing things forever and we

555
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,039
actually have built the toddler system

556
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,400
as a payment system into it so the

557
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,919
providers could ask for your money to

558
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,120
store stuff

559
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
and if you promised to store stuff

560
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
forever well the price would have to be

561
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,000
infinite right but if you say i'm going

562
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
to store your key shares for five years

563
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,679
you can calculate how much it's going to

564
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,960
cost of course you'll be wrong with the

565
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,159
inflation but

566
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,520
at least you have a chance of making a

567
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
business of running the service

568
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
and at the same time i also go and say

569
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,080
well we don't have a deletion capability

570
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
because we said well if somebody could

571
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,840
delete my key shares that might also be

572
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
just as bad as you know keeping them

573
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
right so

574
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
but having an expiration we tell the

575
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
user upfront you know this will be kept

576
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
for five years and then you might want

577
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
to do a re-upload and partially you

578
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,240
might not have the same phone number you

579
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,080
might not have the same physical address

580
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,520
so your authentication methods might

581
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
change so it's a good thing to tell

582
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
users don't do the backup once and

583
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,919
forget about it for the rest of your

584
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,880
life

585
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
the the the providers of holding the

586
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
secrets

587
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,440
if one

588
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
goes out of business or goes bust is it

589
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,559
like a raid system where you can

590
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,919
reallocate that

591
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
to a to another one does that rebuild

592
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
elsewhere automatically

593
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
if the provider is willing to hand over

594
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,120
his database to

595
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
another operator then it would be

596
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
possible if one was compromised or if he

597
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
can't again compromise there's two

598
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
different ways if he loses the data

599
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
then you can't hand it over to somebody

600
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
else right if the data is public well

601
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,159
you can keep operating and give it to

602
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,600
the legitimate users and you just have

603
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,159
to hope that not enough are compromised

604
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,640
for your actual secrets to become known

605
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,799
and is the system in full production now

606
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
is it something that people can use or

607
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
is it just in development right now

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
we believe it can be used but we're in

609
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
the test phase because we're still

610
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
playing around with the user attributes

611
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,919
we're collecting for different countries

612
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,840
the validations and getting some let's

613
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
say initial production experience so we

614
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
don't recommend using it production we

615
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
recommend trying it out and telling us

616
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
what's wrong so people can sign up try

617
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,480
it be beat assessed it already works we

618
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,840
have also a web user interface that you

619
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
can use we have the gtk's interface so

620
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
it works

621
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,679
but

622
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,159
it just works right as in we've just

623
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,840
made it work uh and so

624
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
maybe let's

625
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,039
not do

626
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,200
the five billion dollar bitcoin wallet

627
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
in this tomorrow you know as the only

628
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
way of keeping it secret i would be a

629
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,320
bit worried

630
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
but you can use it and there are not

631
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
really any significant notebooks

632
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,120
okay

633
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,960
cool great thank you very much everyone

634
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,950
so well thank you thanks for the talk

635
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,729
[Applause]

636
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,039
so with

637
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,840

651
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,679

656
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,840
oh it's working okay yeah my name is

657
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
jeff burgess i i um i i work on various

658
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
things i i actually have worked on tyler

659
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,159
before that's why i came and found them

660
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,640
but um the uh

661
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,840
so there's a um so tyler you tyler uses

662
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,520
these blind signatures this is this the

663
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,039
thing that you're

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
hearing about is so the person who signs

665
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
the thing doesn't doesn't know who

666
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,679
doesn't know what they're signing which

667
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,760
is an interesting prop which is a

668
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,320
a useful thing and there's a a number of

669
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
things um

670
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
well maybe maybe i don't want to run off

671
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
in that direction but there's a

672
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,039
there's a number of things that people

673
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
have done with blind signatures where

674
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
you can sort of issue them once and then

675
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,480
and then redeem them many times things

676
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
like this so

677
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,480
uh what i want to tell you about is an

678
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
interesting construction that we came

679
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,039
out uh came up with for doing things at

680
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,640
my current job

681
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,799
it's what um we're calling a ring vrf

682
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
so um

683
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
a vrf stands for verifiable random

684
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,360
function it's everybody here people here

685
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,720
kind of know what a hash function does

686
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
or what a mac is so it's like you you

687
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
it's a function that we believe it's

688
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
kind of a random function

689
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
and and you have uh like

690
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
a key to it and when you put something

691
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,240
into the function

692
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
then then the thing that pops out the

693
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,039
other side looks fairly random rel you

694
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
know um and this key defines which

695
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,279
function from this family of of

696
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,760
functions you're taking okay

697
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
um

698
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
so that's a symmetric cryptographic

699
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,760
construction and you can you can have an

700
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,919
asymmetric one where this is a public or

701
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
this is a public key system so what this

702
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,799
means is that um

703
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
if it's my if it's my function if i know

704
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,760
the secret then um then i can evaluate

705
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
the function and nobody else can

706
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
and but also there's a signature-like

707
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
component which means i can sign

708
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,840
that i

709
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
that that

710
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,440
i can i can produce a signature that

711
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,480
proves

712
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
a particular evaluation of this function

713
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,919
and it doesn't leak anything about any

714
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,600
other evaluations

715
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
okay kind of a nice kind of a

716
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
interesting kind of construction we use

717
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,120
them a lot in um

718
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,640
they're used a lot in certain kinds of

719
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
distributed systems

720
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
fancy new blockchains proof-of-stake

721
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
things uh they're also used in their

722
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
 they should be being used in dns

723
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
sec but they're not yet it's been around

724
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
for a while that proposal

725
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
um anyway the um

726
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
okay so so this thing is these guys are

727
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
signatures you sign something with them

728
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
uh there's another there's also another

729
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,159
kind of signature called a ring

730
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
signature which is that um

731
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
i have a set of people and i just proved

732
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
that one of the guys in the set signed

733
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
and there's okay there's a bunch of

734
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,960
different types of ring signatures

735
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
really really lots of them

736
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
and but one of them people here have

737
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,360
probably heard of zcash

738
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
so z cash is a is a kind of a funky ring

739
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,840
signature where the ring is all of the

740
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,520
keys that have appeared in the chain in

741
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
the past that's a way to think about it

742
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
and so it has this way it keeps growing

743
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
this ring and then when you sign with

744
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,000
one of these utxo keys you can spend the

745
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
money okay

746
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
um

747
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
so so what we needed for something was

748
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
we needed this ring vr vrf for for for a

749
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,799
for a certain protocol we were building

750
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,240
and so what is it it's just a ring

751
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
signature that's also a vrf so you sign

752
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,919
so each key each real key defines some

753
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,760
pseudorandom function

754
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
and and there's a ring which we can keep

755
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
growing and you can sign something with

756
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
it

757
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
uh with one of the keys and with one of

758
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,159
these keys in the ring and what what

759
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,559
that does is that it just proves that

760
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,559
one of the functions in the this is the

761
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,320
evaluate an evaluation of one of the

762
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
functions in the ring

763
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
pretty handy okay so where the idea for

764
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
this thing came from it actually came

765
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
from um this uh from a guy at ap uh the

766
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,600
the

767
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
well i'm the first person who came up

768
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,159
with the term ringvrf but it came

769
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,559
from some work by brian the idea for

770
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,320
doing this came from some work by brian

771
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,840
ford epfl

772
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,440
which says which it basically um

773
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,919
he wants to have an identity system

774
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,880
where you you have

775
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
you have uh

776
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,919
um ids that are issued either well he

777
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,520
wants to do it in a very anarchist way

778
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,799
but you could also have them just be

779
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
government issued so you have these ids

780
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,840
that are say government issued and what

781
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
you do is when you

782
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
when you swipe you tap your card on

783
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,399
something

784
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
it evaluates this this pseudorandom

785
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,039
function and it tell proves to the thing

786
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
that you're where you're tapping your

787
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,600
card

788
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
that you have that you that you've

789
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
evaluated this function correctly

790
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,919
now okay what's that useful for well it

791
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,679
means like you have a very ephemeral id

792
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
i can say look my identity for getting

793
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
into this club today is this or look my

794
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
identity on your particular website i

795
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,000
put in twitter into the or whatever into

796
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
the uh into the random function and my

797
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,559
id that pops out the other side is my

798
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
identity on twitter so what this proves

799
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
is that there's only one me on twitter

800
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,520
or there's only one me going into this

801
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
club today or whatever

802
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
so there's another thing that's very

803
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
useful that you can do with this that is

804
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,840
identity

805
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,720
you can use it for rationing so if you

806
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,080
in france right now we have a mustard

807
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,279
shortage we're about to have a lot of

808
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,200
fuel shortages in europe

809
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,039
you can have you can literally have an

810
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,799
eu ration card

811
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,200
which said which would say

812
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,240
here look i'm i'm an eu i'm an eu

813
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,440
resident

814
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,159
i i want to buy this thing today and

815
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
here's my right to buy mustard today

816
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,559
and you can

817
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
do it on you know you can do it by month

818
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
you can do it a number of times in a day

819
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
whatever they're all unlinkable anyway

820
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
there's a variety of nifty tricks you

821
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
can play with this

822
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
that's this primitive another trick you

823
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,919
can play with a lot of these vrf

824
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,360
protocols can be represented as games

825
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
you can also play cards against humanity

826
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
but that's another within a

827
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,080
decentralized way but that's another

828
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,279
thing i'll talk about another time

829
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,840
ah

830
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,039
so we've got some questions

831
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,320
i have just a short question you said

832
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
that uh it you can with the ha with the

833
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,840
hash definitely proved that someone

834
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
or you can authenticate them as

835
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,799
themselves

836
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,240
but isn't it

837
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,000
technically possible i mean it doesn't

838
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
fit for the analogy

839
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,880
but uh

840
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
that a hash collision could cause two

841
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,840
people

842
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,399
appearing like the same person

843
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,279
yeah well this is um

844
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,720
these hashes are large so so so the the

845
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
there there are 256 bits but the

846
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
elliptic curve only really has 128 bits

847
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,799
of security if somebody wanted to create

848
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
a collision by designing their keys they

849
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
could do it but you can't really do with

850
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
only 128 bits of security but you can't

851
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,000
really break that so you can't even if

852
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
you wanted to to have really different

853
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,360
keys that collided you can't

854
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,919
oh i've got a question over here as well

855
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,039
hi can you just talk a bit about the r

856
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,399
in vrf like verifiable randomness like

857
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,000
can you talk about an application where

858
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,760
that randomness is important and where

859
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,600
it comes from so a lot okay a lot of

860
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,960
times when we're using like in a

861
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,159
cryptographic protocol when we're

862
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
describing a hash function we use what's

863
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,360
called a prf which stands for

864
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
pseudorandom function and the definition

865
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
is basically that we have

866
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,519
a family of functions and we imagine

867
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,519
that we're picking one at random and we

868
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,120
and then we make certain statements

869
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,799
about this okay

870
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
um a vrf is a signature

871
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,679
that i mean there's a formal definition

872
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
we could i can drag out but there's it's

873
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
a signature that essentially

874
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
it has these pseudorandomness properties

875
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,799
and it also also has um

876
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,440
this a bit this fact that you can

877
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
that the the public key

878
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
uniquely determines which prf is running

879
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
or which of these which element of the

880
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
pseudorandom function family is being

881
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,200
picked and that um

882
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,399
and then the

883
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,240
the signature part is you're proving the

884
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
evaluation of this function

885
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
this did that make sense but where do

886
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,080
you get the random randomness from like

887
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
i'm the person you're proving the

888
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,039
randomness always has to be coming there

889
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,320
always has to be something in the well

890
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
the the really the randomness is coming

891
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
from the key

892
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,720
but which is picking which at which

893
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,799
function in this random this family of

894
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,080
random functions but um sorry for

895
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,159
trying to lean for this way in the

896
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
cryptographic language a bit but um

897
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,200
really your

898
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,480
um the real randomness is the key so

899
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,399
which is why i can do something like

900
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,360
twitter

901
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,760
you know on the 14th of july

902
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,919
as my input and claim that the output

903
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,000
that comes out is random is because the

904
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,039
key is really the source of the

905
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,880
randomness however

906
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
um there are a number of applications

907
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,799
including this cards against humanity

908
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,399
thing that i was talking about where you

909
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,640
it's that's not enough you also need the

910
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
ram um so for the identity application

911
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,559
that's enough there's a number of other

912
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,840
applications where you need the

913
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
randomness that you actually need some

914
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
randomness coming in on the things so in

915
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,480
particular if you wanted to any time

916
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
where you're afraid of the users picking

917
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,240
their key to brute force something then

918
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
you need the input to be random and you

919
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,799
need it to be made up afterwards and so

920
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,880
for example if you've paid any attention

921
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
proof of strike blockchains uh aurebor's

922
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
prowess uses that and they have to have

923
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,279
the randomness that goes to the input to

924
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,600
the thing come after all of the keys

925
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,080
said hey we're staking

926
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
thanks

927
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
uh i've got a question so yeah do you

928
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,240
see mainstream um password managers

929
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,760
embodying some of this technology over

930
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,360
time so

931
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,000
um so there's so the vrs there's a

932
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,480
construct a lot of the pake app if

933
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
you've heard of these like uh password

934
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,159
authenticated key so the thing i'm

935
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,080
talking about um wouldn't really be for

936
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,360
password managers i haven't thought

937
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,919
about that um there's a when you talk

938
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,399
about um pake systems which is like

939
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,480
password authenticated key exchanges

940
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,919
they tend to use a primitive that is

941
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
somewhat similar to this but a little

942
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,240
bit different

943
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
great thanks

944
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,679
so we've got a couple of announcements

945
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,840
so

946
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
yeah

947
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
thank you very much

948
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,020
and

949
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,919
[Applause]

950
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
that's certainly well deserved uh hi i'm

951
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,240
trovf i'm one of the guys who are

952
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
actually running the lightning talks and

953
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,679
we are actually looking for speakers so

954
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,440
if you've got a topic then you think

955
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
that's interesting you got unfinished

956
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
unfinished research that you want to

957
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
share or talk about think about it

958
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,040
getting up here is not really difficult

959
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,879
you can or

960
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,320
you don't have to

961
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
have slides so

962
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,639
just get up here and talk um i don't

963
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,879
have any slides with the name just

964
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,000
google lightning talks mch you'll find

965
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,599
the page where you can submit all the

966
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,960
information

967
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
or you can find me or

968
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
some of the other people around the

969
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
ruffle village thank you

970
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,110
[Applause]

971
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,599
yeah

972
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,680
so i was asked to do the ending of this

973
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,640
i'm the co-herald of him

974
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,839
so i have a few things to ask you may uh

975
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,839
first of all is to drink a lot of water

976
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,920
but i think he told that

977
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,000
uh he told you that already

978
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,560
um the second thing is please consider

979
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,040
becoming an angel like

980
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,119
we two are angels we are doing this

981
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
right now and any angel who does a shift

982
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,320
can get an angel shirt that's

983
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,560
this that's not an angel shirt as you

984
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
can probably see

985
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,320
and uh angels who do parking or trash

986
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
they will get a patch

987
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,040
it's probably not that well visible

988
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,240
that's the trash angel patch

989
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,440
and there is an angel for parking they

990
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,680
also get their patch and you can keep it

991
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,520
afterwards and it's just a nice moment

992
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
show

993
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,200
and i have another little thing

994
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,000
all scattered over the camping field are

995
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,839
field phones

996
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,720
these are the ones with the hand cranks

997
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,599
just feel free to uh to use them we can

998
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,680
connect you to anyone on the field if

999
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,920
you could select their deck number

1000
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
or you can connect it to the info desk

1001
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,000
or anywhere else so

1002
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,599
have a nice day and

1003
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,500
be nice to each other

1004
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,199
[Applause]
