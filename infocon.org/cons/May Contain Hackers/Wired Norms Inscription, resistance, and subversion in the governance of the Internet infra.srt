2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
welcome everybody

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
tonight this first night

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,800
we have someone here

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
who is going to introduce us to how to

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
inscript resist and subverse

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
in the governance of the internet

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
infrastructure i hope at least i'm quite

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
interested

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,520
in what nielsen uber has to tell us here

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,719
because um we might not be afraid you

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
told us that we'll not have to be afraid

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
about your talk

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,399
so keep your weapons down um

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,320
keep your phones open

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
and

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
i give you the word thank you give a

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,160
warm welcome to niels

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,120
let's go i am super excited to be here

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
today with you on uh on mch and i'm

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
wired up like beyonce so uh let's hope i

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
can give you the

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
that you are looking for tonight so

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
thanks so much for being on your first

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
night and chose not to be dancing but to

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
actually think and talk about the

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,600
governance of the internet

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,159
infrastructure i got a little test here

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,360
on the screen

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,119
and that says that the internet

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,000
architecture social technical imaginary

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
guides facilitates and legitimates the

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
internet infrastructure but actually the

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
infrastructural norms serve to evaluate

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
and instruct the governance of the

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,799
internet

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
right now you don't understand what this

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
means by the end of the talk you will so

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
let's run that test again by the end and

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
then we'll see where we are and if i've

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,079
succeeded

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
i'm neil stenover i'm a postdoctoral

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
researcher at the university of

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,880
amsterdam

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
and we'll talk to you about my phd

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,680
thesis

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
and it's very cool that i'm talking

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
about this here

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
because this work actually started at

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
home

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
and that's where i met some of the

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
people that i'm still doing the research

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
now with so that's something i'm very

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,599
excited about

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
the work continued at shaw

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
and now i'm presenting it to you at mch

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
so that is great

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,319
i got five of the copies of my book for

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,280
you so if you actually like it

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,680
come and pick it up who wants a book

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
yes can someone distribute it thank you

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
so

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
then you got a way to read it and book

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
the pdf is in the description so you can

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,599
read it that way as well

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,120
and at the end of the talk i got a fun

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
announcement for the future

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,840
so i look at communication

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
infrastructures

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
and i do that because i think that

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
changes to the globalizing world are

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,200
being written not in the language of law

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
and diplomacy but rather in the language

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
of infrastructure

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
and if infrastructure is the language of

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
the changes then standards are its

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
grammar and that's why i look also at

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
the standard setting of the internet

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
and when i talk about the internet

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
infrastructure and its governance i

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
explicitly look at the interconnection

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,760
and physical layer of the internet

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,400
the physical layer are all the antennas

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,120
satellites cables and routers and the

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,959
interconnection layers are actually what

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
make it into one network

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
and this happens in institutions of

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
three and four letters such as the ietf

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,959
icann rers ieee 3gpp and itu

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
but this is not a new thing

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
communication infrastructures have been

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
around for the longest time

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
around

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159
in the 19th century the british had a

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,000
telegraph line that covered all of the

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
world

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
and that was important because it

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
changed the british empire

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
from a colonial

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
to an imperial power

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
it allowed the british to have

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
control

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
directly from london

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,519
over an uh empire that vastly expanded

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
topological means

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
a topographical means and they

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
controlled it through topological means

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
through a network

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
communication networks are always a

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,720
proxy for power and are intrinsically

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
linked with militarism and colonialism

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
the telegraph as i said changed

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,400
colonialism to imperialism by

114
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
establishing centers of power

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
so

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,759
networks established new centers of

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,040
power

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
and in war for instance the first world

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
war the first thing that happened was

120
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,199
that the allies cut the connections of

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
the uh of the german telegraph lines

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
now in ukraine we see again that

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
infrastructure is an object of attacks

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
however

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
there is a difference right now

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
because all parties seek to make the

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
network function not only for them but

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
still connected into this global network

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
this says something about the meaning of

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
the internet

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
we now live in late capitalism

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
where countries were ready to shut off

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
networks of capital

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
such as swift

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
but they were not ready to impose

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
sanctions on the internet infrastructure

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
so what this means that internet and

138
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,120
communication infrastructures are

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
foundational for how the whole world is

140
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
run so it's probably very important that

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
we look at how these networks are

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
governed because that also says

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
something about how the world works

144
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
and infrastructures are always

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,680
relational

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,919
they are not just the physical things

147
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
the things that we can kick

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,919
but there are also the standards the

149
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,280
agreements the labors and institution

150
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,000
that make them function

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
and when we talk about networks

152
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,919
we do not we should not think about that

153
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
global network as one thing

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
because something can be a global

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
network and we can be very different in

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
different localities

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
so we should listen to people on

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
different parts of the world such as the

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
great thinker in ukraine svetlana

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
matayenko who is working and writing in

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
ukraine right now please follow and

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
follow her work

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
but it also means we should think about

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
people who have other practices and

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
languages for instance ramsey nasser

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
once wrote a programming language in

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,280
arabic

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
and he called it engineering performance

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
art

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
and i asked him why ramsay do you call

171
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
this engineering performance art why is

172
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,479
it not just engineering well he said

173
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
because it will never work

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
because the internet structurally

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
rejects

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,280
everything that's not in a latin

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
language

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,120
that means that the earliest application

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
of the internet or one of the first

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,560
email

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,880
works perfectly for many of us

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
but if you if your name is in a

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,199
non-latin language friends if you're

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
chinese

185
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
and you cannot have an email address

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
with your own name in your own script

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
that means that that global internet is

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
very different for other people

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
in different in different areas with

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
different languages and it can also make

191
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,639
few people at home but it can also

192
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,360
exclude people and it does this all the

193
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
time

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
so submarine cables now connect the

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
whole world but if we actually look at

196
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,720
how it's ordered

197
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
it provides a particular ordering of

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
power extraction and control that

199
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
reproduce power

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
uh repressive power structures as they

201
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
exist and reinforce power structures as

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
they have existed over the centuries

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
so in this first part of the talk i'm

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,879
going to cover a part

205
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
that was uh

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
that looks at specifically at the

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
internet engineering task force

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
so the internet engineering task force

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
is one of the oldest bodies that produce

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
the internet and you might know it from

211
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
rfcs who of you has ever read an rfc

212
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
right so then you know that if you start

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
that an rfc is an abbreviation for a

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,479
request for comments but if you start

215
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
commenting once it's an rfc you're

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
actually too late

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
because then it's already a foundational

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,520
document but previously it's called an

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
internet draft

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
and when it's an internet draft

221
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,759
in people from the internet engineering

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
task force discuss how it works over

223
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
mailing lists this is a photo of the

224
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,679
internet engineering task force in uh

225
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
uh in toronto canada

226
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,080
and this was actually right before the

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
meeting during the meeting where they

228
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
decided that the internet engineering

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,440
task force could not have a meeting in

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
india because the infrastructure there

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
was too bad

232
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
and what then happened was that the

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,240
power went off

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
and what was so funny that the meeting

235
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
just continued in the glow of all the

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
screens of the laptops and no one

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
actually

238
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,279
gave gave even a small hiccup

239
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
so this also shows ironically that it's

240
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
the people

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
that make the infrastructure work on

242
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
what they expect it to work and how they

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,200
expect to do business

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
so to do this it's important to

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
understand

246
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
how this work is guided and for that i

247
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,200
use i borrow a term from a sociology

248
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
from science and technology studies it's

249
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
called a socio-technical imaginary and a

250
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
socio-technical imaginary is a vision of

251
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
how something should work that brings

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
people together to create something

253
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
and the electronic super highway is an

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,560
example of such a thing

255
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
so what is so interesting about the ietf

256
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
is that it produces these rfcs and

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
they've done it since the end of the 60s

258
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
in the same format

259
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
and all the debates happen on mailing

260
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
lists which is great for researchers

261
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
such as me because it allows us to do

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,959
computational analysis of all their

263
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
conversations but also to analyze all

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
the archives of all the discussions of

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
how the internet is works what are the

266
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
rules of the road

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,640
so i did a qualitative anal a

268
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
quantitative analysis of all rfcs a

269
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,880
qualitative analysis of 50 rfcs

270
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
qualitative and quantitative analysis of

271
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
mailing lists a total of 35 gigabytes

272
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,320
and almost 2 million emails of 955 email

273
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
lists and participate participant

274
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
observation during four years and 11

275
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
meetings of the ietf

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,560
so

277
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,079
what i thought

278
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
what i would find there was many

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,399
different socio-technical imaginaries of

280
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
what people thought the internet would

281
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,800
be

282
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
what it would be for them

283
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
but what i found is actually there were

284
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
three things that they all said that the

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
internet was three foundational

286
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
principles

287
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,160
the first one was the end-to-end

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
principle

289
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
and the end-to-end principle says that

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
intelligence in the network is at the

291
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
edges the network only exists for

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
datagram transport that it has low

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
complexity and high robustness

294
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
but at the same time when you look at an

295
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,640
rfc

296
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,040
1958 this end-to-end principle is not

297
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
just a technical principle

298
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,399
because read with me here

299
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
the community believes that the goal is

300
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,360
connectivity the tool is the internet

301
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
protocol and intelligence is end to end

302
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,880
rather than hidden in the network

303
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
and while doing

304
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
participant observation you find many

305
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,200
different ways where values and ideals

306
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,399
are stored

307
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
one of them is on t-shirts

308
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
many of you will be wearing t-shirts

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
which communicate ideas and identities

310
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,959
and here it also shows that this is also

311
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,279
inherently political and this is then

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,720
also shown again in another rfc

313
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,480
3935 and it says the internet isn't

314
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,760
value neutral and neither is the ietf

315
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
we want the internet to be useful for

316
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
communities that share our commitment to

317
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
openness and fairness we embrace

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
technical concepts such as decentralized

319
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,560
control edge user empowerment and

320
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
sharing of resources because those

321
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,399
concept resonates with the core values

322
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,959
of the ietf community these concepts

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
have little to do with the technology

324
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
that's possible and much to do with the

325
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
technology we choose to create

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
this sounds more

327
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,040
like the manifesto of a group of

328
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,480
anarcho-syndicalists than a standard

329
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
body of multinational corporations that

330
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
run the internet

331
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
right

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
so that's a funny thing to find so let's

333
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,519
see how that works out

334
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
so there's the second principle of

335
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,839
permissionless innovation and i cannot

336
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,360
reiterate enough

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
almost every interviewee said these were

338
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
the main things so permission innovation

339
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
permissionless innovation says that

340
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,279
there should be no barriers to the

341
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
deployment of new protocols there should

342
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
be no need to negotiate with entities in

343
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
the middle of the network

344
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
and this is probably a response to the

345
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
telco era where in the telco era

346
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
intelligence was in the network and the

347
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
endnotes were dumb

348
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,000
uh the endnotes were dumb and the

349
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
network was smart but now in the

350
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,200
internet it was turned around and in the

351
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
network was made dumb just to transport

352
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,480
packets and the end points were smart

353
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
but it was also a response arguably to

354
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
the accessible use policy of the arpanet

355
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,959
and the nsf net that said that no

356
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,040
commercial traffic was allowed on the

357
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
internet so up to the early 90s no

358
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
commercial traffic was allowed on the

359
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
internet so if everyone ever anyone ever

360
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
tells you that the internet is a product

361
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
of companies and capitalism it's not

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
true it was publicly funded made at

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,560
universities and with government money

364
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
but in the 90s this changed

365
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,360
the third principle was that of openness

366
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
and that has three parts

367
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
network openness that any endpoint on

368
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
the internet should be reachable for any

369
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
other end point and that new endpoints

370
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
can be added

371
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,000
they should consist of open standards

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
that are voluntary and freely accessible

373
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
and of open governance that's

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
transparent open participation and have

375
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
open archives exactly the principles

376
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,079
that allows me to research it today

377
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
and that then results in very

378
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
interesting

379
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,839
configurations such as this the

380
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,560
unofficial motto of the ietf which as we

381
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
reject kings and presidents and voting

382
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
we believe in rough consensus and

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
running code

384
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,079
and this was an ex very explicit

385
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,880
reference to the international

386
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,560
telecommunications union that has that

387
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
has governed previous networks such as

388
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,160
the telegraph tv and spectrum

389
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
that does voting and that is governed by

390
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,920
countries no the ietf would do so based

391
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,800
on rough consensus and running codes

392
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
does anyone know how rough consensus is

393
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
established in the itf

394
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,880
it is indeed humming so if we want to

395
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
decide about the length of an ip header

396
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,880
and it would one should say 128 they'll

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
say 265 and i would be a working group

398
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,600
chair if you believe the header should

399
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,160
be 128 bits please hum now

400
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
you got the concept right so that is

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
quite amazing that this is how the

402
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,839
internet is governed and how the

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
decision making is designed right

404
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,399
so the work of sandra brahman shows that

405
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,800
explicit discussions about rights and

406
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
freedoms as we've seen in these rfcs as

407
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
well as social impact of technologies

408
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
have featured in rfcs since their

409
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
beginnings

410
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
so now we take a step take a step back

411
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
earlier i already gave it away

412
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
if we need to pinpoint

413
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,759
the start of the internet

414
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
what event would it be

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
what is this

416
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
sputnik the lounge of sputnik satellites

417
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
in october 1957 by the soviet union

418
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
it emitted what time magazine would call

419
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
those chilling beeps

420
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
beep

421
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,880
beep

422
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
beep

423
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
this device that was exactly my weight

424
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
and it was shot into the into the

425
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
atmosphere

426
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,279
and that was actually there

427
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,000
was a symbol of the technological and

428
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
scientific advancement of the soviet

429
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,959
union over all civilizations on the

430
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,720
planet and that instilled enormous fear

431
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
in other countries

432
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,639
this led the u.s to invest in a network

433
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,440
that could resist a nuclear strike

434
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,079
and that caused the distributed nature

435
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,399
of the internet

436
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,440
so in the end of the 80s and early 90s

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
what happened

438
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
the fall of the berlin wall right so

439
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
that's when the u.s government seeded

440
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
direct control over the arpanets the nsf

441
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
nets the es net and it led to the

442
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,679
establishment of commercial internet

443
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,880
exchanges

444
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
and to the formal institutionalization

445
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,959
of the internet governance regime that

446
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
we know now such as the internet

447
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
engineering task force the internet

448
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
society and regional internet registries

449
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
but at one of these first meetings of

450
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
the internet engineering task force

451
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
a german

452
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
statistician

453
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
raised his hand somehow the

454
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
statisticians are almost always german i

455
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
don't know why but he said if we

456
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
continue

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
handing out ip addresses

458
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
at this rate

459
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,880
within three years we cannot add new

460
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
devices to the network anymore

461
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
and that would be a great problem

462
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
because then the internet could not live

463
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,919
up to the concept of uh of openness

464
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,240
anymore right because new endpoints

465
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
could not be added to the network so

466
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,919
what happened

467
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,240
the introduction of network address

468
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
translation

469
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,840
this meant that routers would have a

470
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,480
public ip address but that but that

471
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
there were inter private ip addresses

472
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
that would be shared over several

473
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
devices

474
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,600
what happened as well there were

475
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,160
increasing security considerations the

476
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
internet was no longer comprised of

477
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
trusted actors so firewalls were

478
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
instated and there was a perceived need

479
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
from network operators to differentiate

480
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
business models and provide quality of

481
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
service caching and prioritization of

482
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
services

483
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,559
so a lot of networks started to do a lot

484
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
of bad things to the network they were

485
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,559
not just solving ip but they were adding

486
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,720
control inside the network

487
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
and this rise of the middle box added

488
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,520
functionality to the network not at the

489
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
edges of the network but in the network

490
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
itself

491
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
and this led already in the beginning to

492
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,600
an ossification of the network

493
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
so in this introduction of

494
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,000
directionality of not boxes which caused

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,640
not all endpoints to be able to connect

496
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
to all other end points directly

497
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,679
introduce a direct directionality which

498
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,679
created two classes clients and servers

499
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,880
users

500
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
and producers

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
and that made the importance of servers

502
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,520
way more important than that of other

503
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,919
devices this device

504
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
has way more capacity than any web

505
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
server had for the longest time on the

506
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,320
internet but still we cannot simply host

507
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
a website on this because it's not

508
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
reachable because of carrier grade nuts

509
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
and this created a new affordance

510
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,640
structure in the internet architecture

511
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
and an example of this is tls 1.3 so

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
you're all familiar with transport layer

513
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
security that's allowing for the s in

514
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,679
https the most used secured

515
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
encryption algorithm on the internet

516
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,520
but in the development of tls 1.3

517
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,799
they came across a big problem

518
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,679
people were experimenting with tls 1.3

519
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
but it wouldn't work on the network

520
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
why not

521
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
because all these middle boxes were

522
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
expecting only tls 1.2

523
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,120
they did not know what tls 1.3 was so

524
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
they would simply drop the packets of

525
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,520
tls 1.3

526
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,240
so

527
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,200
tls 1.3 to be deployed now needs to lie

528
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,360
to all the routers in the middle by

529
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,880
saying actually i'm tls 1.2 but then

530
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
when it reaches the end point it says oh

531
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
sorry i'm actually tls 1.3 but i had to

532
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
lie to the network

533
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
this means

534
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
that if we want to design the network of

535
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
the future it needs to look like the

536
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
past

537
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
this is the result of middle boxes and

538
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
ossification of the network

539
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
but tls 1.3 was actually still quite a

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
success

541
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
and this cannot be said for the stream

542
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,559
control transmission protocol

543
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,360
the

544
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,080
stream control transmission protocol was

545
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,760
supposed to be a more efficient

546
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
replacement for tcp

547
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
had multiple streams multiple

548
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
transmission paths no head of blocking

549
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
and it's actually described in 39 rfcs

550
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
and it worked perfectly in the lab but

551
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
was blocked by almost all nets

552
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,280
and this means it never really reliably

553
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
worked on the internet it worked in

554
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
almost it works on pretty much all telco

555
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
systems but it never works on the

556
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,360
internet

557
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
so the first rfc of satp was

558
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
published in april 2002

559
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
and the last rfc was published in

560
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
november 2017

561
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,799
and people indeed blamed the network for

562
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,000
this

563
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,480
but someone swift in to solve the

564
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,440
problem through the rise of quick the

565
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,919
quick udp internet protocol which is a

566
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,720
stream based protocol similar to satp

567
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
but

568
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
developed by google

569
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
and google could develop this because it

570
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,760
could do a b testing between the biggest

571
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,559
browser in the world chrome and almost

572
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,360
servers everywhere in the world google's

573
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,159
content distribution networks

574
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
and probably you have been taken part in

575
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
the testing of quick without knowing it

576
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,720
because you were using chrome in many

577
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,240
different environments and thereby

578
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
passing information back to google to

579
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,559
see how and whether it works and which

580
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,039
versions of quick actually worked and if

581
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
it didn't it would simply fall back to

582
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
tcp

583
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,360
so quick is actually a pretty great

584
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
thing because

585
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,520
it includes tls 1.3 so encryption it

586
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,159
does congestion control loss recovery

587
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
and it's built on udp pretty much the

588
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
way i'm presenting i'm sending you way

589
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,480
too much information all the time

590
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,799
so what it does what it does do with

591
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,360
this encryption after snowden of course

592
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
got a lot of interest but it does not

593
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,799
only encrypt your information it also

594
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,679
ensures that only you and google have

595
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
that information and all control over

596
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
data streams is taken from the hands of

597
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
the network operators so they cannot

598
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
inspect the traffic anymore or route it

599
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
based on

600
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
stuff they get from the data analysis

601
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
so what we see in tcp is sin synoc if

602
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,480
you do it with tls synths in ack then we

603
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
negotiate keys and tls control and so

604
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,799
you have a lot of back and forth

605
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
in quick

606
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
this would go way

607
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
quicker

608
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,559
so

609
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,679
quick was a win right so oh well that's

610
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,880
end well

611
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,840
well

612
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,640
maybe not because only a large

613
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,799
transnational corporation such as google

614
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,240
that had control over the largest

615
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
browser in the world and the largest cdn

616
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
network could gather that information to

617
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
develop a new protocol and actually roll

618
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
it out

619
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
quick tooling is not readily available

620
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,039
for everyone yet

621
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
and quick deployment will arguably

622
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,840
strengthen consolidation of google and

623
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,320
these large parties because other people

624
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
have less access and possibility to

625
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
shape and change

626
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
information streams

627
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,480
also

628
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
it is much harder for privacy

629
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
researchers ironically to understand

630
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,400
what google is doing so all the

631
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
research done on cookies

632
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
is not as easily done now because

633
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,799
network researchers cannot look at the

634
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,360
data streams and the practices of google

635
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
because the line between you and google

636
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,760
is encrypted at all times

637
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,679
and the network operators

638
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,400
one can think one you know are not

639
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,240
pleased because they also have less

640
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
control over their data streams

641
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
so the former chair of the ietf told me

642
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,880
that you now if you want to deploy

643
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,279
something you need to play in some of

644
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
the operators or vendors earning models

645
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,760
in order to get something deployed

646
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
so that is quite different from the

647
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,679
imaginary at the beginning where it said

648
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,279
that everyone could deploy everything on

649
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
the internet all the time right

650
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
and if we then look

651
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
at the the authors and affiliation of

652
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
the authors of the rfcs we see that

653
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,480
actually a relatively small number of

654
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,520
companies are setting the rules

655
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
for the development of the internet

656
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,559
architecture and infrastructure

657
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
so these myths these social technical

658
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,919
imaginaries might be important for what

659
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,480
they reveal including a genuine desire

660
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
for community and democracy but also for

661
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,679
what they conceal including the growing

662
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,080
concentration of communication power in

663
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,760
a handful of transnational media

664
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
businesses

665
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,279
so the socio-technical

666
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,080
architecture imaginary and itself

667
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,760
regulatory governance model have not

668
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
been able to safeguard freedom and

669
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
equality of researchers small companies

670
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
or individuals to innovate on the

671
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
internet protocol level

672
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,279
and permissionless innovation for the

673
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,760
purpose of retaining openness has

674
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
undermined itself

675
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,480
and the end-to-end principle

676
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
corporate interests have become a

677
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,559
first-order considerations for protocols

678
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,720
to be adopted and implemented and

679
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,480
political conceptions of the

680
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
architectural imaginary are fading into

681
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
the background

682
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
the importance and size of the internet

683
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
architecture has only grown as we now

684
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
see that everyone wants to keep

685
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
everything connected all the time and

686
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
within the societal implications

687
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,240
but the societal implications are not

688
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
structurally considered in the

689
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
standardization of the internet

690
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
so

691
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
some considerations have taken up such

692
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,919
as the mentioning of security in rfcs

693
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,960
so here in 1990 it became obligatory to

694
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
have security considerations in rfcs so

695
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
they are mentioned in all rfcs

696
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,279
privacy is increasingly mentioned

697
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,080
but

698
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,679
if you look at the length of the

699
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
security considerations

700
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,000
there's a lot of copy paste and they

701
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
might not be as thorough as we want them

702
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,520
to be

703
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,159
so to think then about other

704
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,760
conceptualizations together with corinth

705
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,919
and other people we developed human

706
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,520
rights human rights protocol

707
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
considerations

708
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,440
to develop ways that you protocol

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
developers could think of how their work

710
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,880
impacts human rights

711
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,200
so to show you how

712
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
this was actually taken up in the ietf i

713
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,720
show you the first human rights protocol

714
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,159
considerations

715
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,080
in the first rfc that came out after

716
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
this namely rfc 8492

717
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,279
that says

718
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,200
the most fundamental of human rights is

719
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
the right to protect oneself

720
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,279
the right to keep and bear arms is an

721
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
example of this right

722
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
implementations of tls passwords can be

723
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
used as arms kept and born to defend

724
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
oneself against all manner of attackers

725
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,559
criminals governments lawyers etc

726
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,039
therefore tls password is a powerful

727
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,279
tool in the promotion and defense of

728
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,919
universal human rights

729
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,000
so you see there are very different

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
understandings of human rights in the

731
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
community

732
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,399
so now let's continue to the second part

733
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,159
where we look at norm conflicts in the

734
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
governance of transnational

735
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,399
and distributed infrastructures the case

736
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,159
of internet routing

737
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,919
so in this next part of my research i

738
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,240
try to understand how norm setting and

739
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
norm conflict work in distributed and

740
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
complex transnational infrastructure

741
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,399
such as internet routing

742
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,559
so you know about internet routing right

743
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,080
you know that the internet is a network

744
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,919
of networks these networks are

745
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,159
autonomous systems autonomous systems

746
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
have an autonomous system number these

747
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
are assigned by regional internet

748
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
registries and regional internet

749
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,320
registries also hand out ip blocks to

750
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,559
these autonomous systems and between

751
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,120
them they're route internet traffic

752
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,480
and that happens through the border

753
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
gateway protocol that does announcements

754
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,919
who has control over which ip blocks uh

755
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,240
and and filtering happens based on that

756
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,799
and is secured through rpki sorry if i

757
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
go a bit fast sometimes i'm a fallen

758
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
over letterbox but if you have questions

759
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,679
we have we have time for that

760
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,600
so you see all these different networks

761
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
they all have different numbers and they

762
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,399
route network uh traffic between them if

763
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,520
they don't have a direct connection to a

764
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,799
network uh where they want to the the

765
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
connection of this uh the computer with

766
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,679
this ip address wants to reach

767
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,080
the computer with this ip address it

768
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,880
asks the computer of this network us hey

769
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,399
do you have this network no but i'm

770
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,480
connected to that network and through

771
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,799
that packets get routed all over the

772
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,880
globe right and if one connection gets

773
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,039
gets cut it finds its way through other

774
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,320
ways through that network

775
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,880
so this is a way of the way all these

776
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
networks are connected but that seems to

777
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,039
be a very technical and

778
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,399
not very value-based approach

779
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,279
but some really important thinkers of uh

780
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
early internet architects already said

781
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,960
in an important paper different

782
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
stakeholders that are part of the

783
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
internet bio have different interests

784
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,399
that may be adverse

785
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,799
accommodating this tussle is crucial to

786
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,200
the evolution of the internet of the

787
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,799
network's technical architecture

788
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,679
but currently routing decisions are made

789
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,000
based on a mixture of efficiency trust

790
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,919
and economics

791
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,720
and this is facilitated by the rir as i

792
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
earlier mentioned so i thought let's

793
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,159
design an experiment if we could do

794
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,440
routing based on other principles

795
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
so what principles could these be these

796
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,080
needs should be relevant of course they

797
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,559
should be applicable and these should be

798
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,000
existing frameworks i didn't want to

799
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,520
come up with a new existing new

800
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,519
framework and these frameworks should be

801
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,919
transnational such as the internet

802
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,360
so what are the frameworks that you

803
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
think that i could use for this

804
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,799
of course you're all beloved gdpr

805
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,039
so if a network says hey we respect the

806
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,559
gdpr

807
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
and you as a user only want to route

808
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,840
your traffic through networks that

809
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,320
respect the gdpr it would be cool if

810
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,600
networks say hey i respect gdpr right i

811
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
thought that could be useful

812
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
or even

813
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
if networks could say hey

814
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,919
i respect human rights and particularly

815
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,159
the united nations guiding principles on

816
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,159
business and human rights that made it

817
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,480
possible for also to understand if

818
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,799
companies respect human rights

819
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,159
so for that

820
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,120
uh i proposed an introduction of two

821
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
objects in the ripe database namely the

822
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
as set gdpr which would say that the

823
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,399
members of this set declare to be

824
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,000
compliant with the general data

825
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,679
protection regulation of the european

826
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
union or the asu and gp which would say

827
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,559
that the members of this set declared to

828
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,640
have adopted and implemented the united

829
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,320
nations guiding principles on business

830
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
and human rights

831
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
so i announced this

832
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,080
i tried to get networks to sign up to

833
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,640
this so that we would actually get to

834
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
route over only human rights respecting

835
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
networks wouldn't that be great

836
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,760
people didn't agree

837
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
no one signed up to these as sets

838
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,399
why

839
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,120
seems like a good idea right

840
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
so i argue this is because of

841
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,799
infrastructural normativity and the

842
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,640
interview i basis on the interviews i

843
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
did with the people that responded to

844
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,120
this

845
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,799
so norms are the common values of

846
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,039
society and the collective expectations

847
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,720
of property behavior of actors with a

848
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
given identity and they have four

849
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
aspects namely identity behavior

850
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,080
propriety and collective collective

851
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,159
expectations

852
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,640
so i from that i found that there is an

853
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
infrastructural norm of voluntary

854
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
interconnection that network operators

855
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,159
are expected to produce interconnection

856
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,840
based on voluntary bottom-up

857
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,000
collaboration and trust

858
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,519
and they believe that the network

859
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,960
facilitates and engages in

860
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,440
interconnection through the bgp protocol

861
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,279
that in this case ripe coordinates and

862
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,039
facilitates interconnection through the

863
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
ripe database everyone has control over

864
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
their own networks and interconnection

865
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,760
is based on incentive structures and

866
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,880
enlightened self-interest

867
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,360
and the reason given

868
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,799
given to me

869
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,760
why

870
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,399
gdpr and human rights should not be a

871
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,640
basis for routing were based on

872
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,440
technology saying well the routers do

873
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,159
not really allow for that why would we

874
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,600
prioritize implementing that in software

875
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
for an institutional response the

876
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
database is not meant for that this is

877
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
not what we intend to do we don't do

878
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,760
politics we're we're here to be neutral

879
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,840
and impartial

880
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
this is not how it's done based on

881
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,399
identity but also economy there is no

882
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,279
economic incentive to do this no no

883
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,080
other company asks for this no user asks

884
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,039
for this why should we do this

885
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,159
so what norms get resisted

886
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,399
so everything that complicates or

887
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
hampers inc

888
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,359
interconnection

889
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,239
laws such as the gdpr but also ethical

890
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,480
frameworks such as the ungp

891
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,800
jurisdictions such as schengen routing

892
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,879
which was also rejected but also

893
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,839
sanctions and security measures

894
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,560
and

895
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,918
this was also something that was

896
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,800
reflected in a recent call when uh the

897
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
ukrainian government asked for the

898
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
blockades of

899
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,280
of russian ip addresses

900
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,918
right swiftly respond the ripe ncc board

901
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,239
quickly responded that the executive

902
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,480
board of ripe ntc is committed to taking

903
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
all lawful steps to ensure that the ripe

904
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,760
ncc can provide undisrupted service to

905
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
all members across our service region

906
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,079
and the global internet community

907
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,320
the ripe ncc will publicly document all

908
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
its efforts to ensure that the registry

909
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,119
registry is not negatively affected by

910
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
laws regulations or political

911
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,480
developments

912
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
so the ripe ncc is committed to take all

913
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
lawful steps available to ensure that

914
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,119
the russian military

915
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,400
keeps on being active on the internet

916
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,280
you could call it impartial as rype ncc

917
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
does

918
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,359
are not so neutral indeed

919
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,280
so the voluntary interconnection norm

920
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
instructs the community of network

921
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
operators to create more interconnection

922
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,079
between and among networks and resist

923
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,200
any norm or value that could hamper that

924
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,680
so the internet governance is guided by

925
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,520
internet architecture social technical

926
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,839
imaginary arc

927
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,560
anchored in architectural values and

928
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
and process values such as openness and

929
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,440
transparency and the socio-technical

930
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,280
internet architecture imaginary serves

931
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,040
to guide and facilitate the process of

932
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
norm development and legitimizes the

933
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,680
current institutional ordering even if

934
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,800
they are

935
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
concretely subverted in practice

936
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
remember only google could actually do

937
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,839
that

938
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,000
and infrastructural norms exist to

939
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
instruct new norm development and

940
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
evaluate norms that are being introduced

941
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,560
and introduction of norms is only

942
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,880
successful if the candidate norm serves

943
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,400
the interest of these significantly

944
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,880
represented groups and the new norms are

945
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
not in conflict with the overarching

946
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,800
infrastructural norm of voluntary

947
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
interconnection

948
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,640
and then by now

949
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,839
you should be getting this

950
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,119
so the internet governance regime

951
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,760
i'd argue undermines its own authority

952
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,400
scope and legitimacy because it resists

953
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,480
norms that are in the interest of nation

954
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
states and individuals

955
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
we need to rethink the network

956
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
ideologies that underpin the foundation

957
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,880
of our information society

958
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
the internet infrastructure get much

959
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,200
less attention and platforms algorithms

960
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,160
algorithms etc even though it impacts

961
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,640
everything that happens on top

962
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
we need new network ideologies

963
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,240
right now we might be at a new sputnik

964
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,119
moment

965
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,640
come think with us

966
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,119
and for that we are establishing the new

967
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,440
critical infrastructure lab to research

968
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
power contestation in the global digital

969
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
infrastructures and we're doing that

970
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,000
together with maxi gus

971
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,599
and fika

972
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,440
so if you want to think with us about

973
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,359
this we will be thinking and working on

974
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,920
this for the coming years so please come

975
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,839
come talk with us after this ask

976
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
questions and we'll hope to be studying

977
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
this with you come find us today

978
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,240
tomorrow or any given day and um

979
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,839
thanks so much happy hacking

980
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,560
thank you niels uh

981
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
thank you both as well for collaborating

982
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
here it was a fantastic speech i expect

983
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
there are a lot of questions here we

984
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
have a couple of minutes couple are

985
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
there are the questions from the

986
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,680
internet let's start there

987
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,599
no

988
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,839
no one then someone here in the hall

989
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,440
okay please sir take a microphone there

990
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
there's another microphone in the back

991
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,160
so if someone wants you

992
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,800
um hello you said that the introduction

993
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
of network address translation kind of

994
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,920
led to this split into clients and

995
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,440
servers

996
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,680
you think maybe ipv6 could undo this in

997
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
a way

998
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
thank you

999
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
so

1000
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,320
what we

1001
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,960
so for the longest time

1002
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,359
this is what we hoped right

1003
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
but if we now see uh um

1004
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,240
we see different things happening with

1005
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,720
the deployment of ipv6

1006
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
and the first thing was

1007
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
to be observed that there were

1008
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,200
carrier-grade nuts all over ipv6

1009
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,480
and but at the same time we also see

1010
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
that

1011
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,160
uh censorship measures are not working

1012
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,440
as effectively on ipv6 as ipv4

1013
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
so for an end user there might be some

1014
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,839
advantages but if we look at structural

1015
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,160
ways in which networks are managed

1016
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
unfortunately

1017
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,680
we see that a lot of these behaviors

1018
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,079
from ipv4 roll over into ipv6 and that's

1019
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,000
where we see that it's really not just

1020
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
the technology but also the cultures and

1021
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,880
identities and incentives of the

1022
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
engineers and the companies that are

1023
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
working on this to not have completely

1024
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,000
separate stacks but to manage ipv6 in

1025
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,640
the same way people have managed ipv4 so

1026
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
unfortunately

1027
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,720
the way it looks now not yet

1028
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,160
yes next question please

1029
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,280
hi

1030
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,040
so you showed the participation at itf

1031
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,320
which is heavily skewed towards large

1032
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
companies

1033
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,040
do you

1034
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
want to invite the hackers to actually

1035
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,359
join itf and the regional registry

1036
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,960
communities

1037
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
to change what's happening there

1038
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,280
this is a question of conscience

1039
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,640
and i think i don't have the answer

1040
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,319
so i think there is not one way to the

1041
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,599
future there are many different ways

1042
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,079
but i think that that it's very hard as

1043
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
you've all known within your company

1044
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,079
within your own cultural groups within

1045
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,359
your own social groups it's very complex

1046
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,200
and hard to change a group's culture

1047
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,400
and it's very hard to change

1048
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,040
set embedded interests

1049
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,520
so i definitely think we should

1050
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,480
participate

1051
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,560
regain control regain knowledge and

1052
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,240
understand how things work by

1053
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,880
participating in these bodies but at the

1054
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,119
same time we should also think of

1055
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,680
alternative economies and alternative

1056
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,520
ideologies on which

1057
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,599
global communication networks should be

1058
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,119
run

1059
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,079
so

1060
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
yes and no

1061
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
so i do think that we have a lot to

1062
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,560
learn from these uh from these

1063
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,800
institutions and don't get me wrong i

1064
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,240
don't think these institutions are bad

1065
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
but they have developed in a particular

1066
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
way to run the networks based on

1067
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
particular cultures and particular

1068
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,000
incentives

1069
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,040
when i introduced this work in a

1070
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,200
in the ietf and in ripe people said

1071
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
don't bring human rights you're

1072
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
politicizing things

1073
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
but at the same time

1074
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,720
economic economic values played in all

1075
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
these measures all the time

1076
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,240
and even

1077
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,920
economic interests are part of bgp4

1078
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,359
so

1079
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,520
financial incentives are seen as not

1080
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,160
political i think this is structurally

1081
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
wrong and i think we should find a way

1082
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
in which in which we can develop a new

1083
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,280
social technical uh imaginary and a

1084
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,839
network ideology that make that makes

1085
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,200
network function in different ways

1086
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,520
especially in the light of the rising

1087
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
inequality in the world and the climate

1088
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,118
crisis that is right ahead of us

1089
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,160
please

1090
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,359
so you also said that

1091
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,960
the

1092
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,680
philosophy and or norms of the internet

1093
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,880
development

1094
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,319
uh came as a reaction to how the telcos

1095
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,200
were structured so where do you see

1096
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
this um

1097
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,640
uh the the the changes coming as a

1098
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,280
reaction to how the internet functions

1099
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,079
right now where do you see this coming

1100
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,720
from and where could people

1101
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,599
kind of go to enjoy except for your lab

1102
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,839
but like where else do you see this

1103
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,560
coming to replace the old internet with

1104
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,240
something new

1105
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,880
well interestingly there is a lot of

1106
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,160
interest actually intel code development

1107
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,960
so

1108
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,800
a lot of the new research we've been

1109
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,640
doing in the past years is actually on

1110
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
the rollout of 5g

1111
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,839
and telcos have a benefit over the

1112
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,240
internet is that every 10 years they

1113
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,800
have a new generation of technologies

1114
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,319
so a friend of mine asked me why was god

1115
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,119
to why was god able to

1116
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,480
to create mankind in six days

1117
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,319
because there was no pre-installed user

1118
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,680
base

1119
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,800
and

1120
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,560
where the internet is continuously

1121
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,280
backward compatible telco networks can

1122
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,040
start over again and again and again

1123
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,480
every 10 years

1124
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,280
so

1125
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,119
5g is a huge push for a new networking

1126
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,839
but you also see a huge discontent among

1127
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,920
people against the roll out of the

1128
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,000
technologies that's taking form of the

1129
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,240
burning of masts

1130
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
so we see that there is a discontent

1131
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,720
and we see that in regulation we see

1132
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,319
that in the actions such as burning of

1133
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,720
mass about how the internet political

1134
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,480
economy is functioning

1135
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,119
so there is now a moment a political

1136
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,240
moment to rethink these structures and i

1137
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,960
think we shouldn't

1138
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,520
let that depend on individuals because

1139
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,079
that's almost as saying fixing the pro

1140
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,160
fixing climate change happen with taking

1141
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,560
a plane or not eating meat no

1142
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
this is an industrial level problem that

1143
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,800
we should address also through nation

1144
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,760
states and large movements the internet

1145
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,839
was built through investments of nation

1146
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,599
states where gaia x went wrong was by

1147
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,319
giving it over to companies that took

1148
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,480
away the vision from developing actually

1149
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
a new network and standardize what they

1150
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
were already doing so i think we should

1151
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,920
be courageous and find new ways but new

1152
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,040
ways are never built in all structures

1153
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,640
so if you're asking where does the new

1154
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
come from i cannot say but the new

1155
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,960
internet will not come from the internet

1156
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,880
whoa

1157
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,680
whoa thank you very much neil sinova for

1158
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,000
this fascinating and really intriguing

1159
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
speech there was a lot of things to

1160
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,400
discuss afterwards i hope people can

1161
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,040
find a way to you to do that yes thank

1162
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,279
