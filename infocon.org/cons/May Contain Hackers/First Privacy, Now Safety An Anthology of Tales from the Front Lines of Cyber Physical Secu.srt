[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
thanks for joining me for this talk uh

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
what i wanted to bring to this scenario

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
today was something

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
a slightly

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,439
different than

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
most of the talks that that have are

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
being presented

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
driving a bit away from the idea of

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,640
basically computers being used only as a

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
matter of privacy it's a matter of data

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,399
as a matter of you know like basically

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
how you keep your information from being

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
read or used for different purposes

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,320
and driving a bit more of the

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,280
conversation to how these flows of

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
information actually can also impact in

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
the physical world

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,239
so those of you that are familiar with

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,800
the terms uh industrial control systems

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
operational technologies cyber physical

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
things like that you might know already

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
where this is going

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,480
and well the point is also to share a

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,519
bit of um of the stories i don't want to

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,119
bore you only with the theory of what

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,479
could happen

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,080
some ideas but actually things that have

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
already happened things that we see in

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,799
the like threat intelligence community

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
and also uh talk to you from a different

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
perspective of threat intelligence as an

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,880
outsider

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
so to start this actually i thought

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
talking about a bit about personal

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,759
experience but in a in a way that

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,520
probably is not expected to to be seen

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
in here which is by talking about where

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
i come from

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
um the place where i come from is

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
actually mexico

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
so

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
probably you could have guessed with

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,320
some some of this maybe somewhere in

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
latin america and

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
what

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
it's not about this country is well the

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
country is well known for food is well

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
known for uh happiness is well known for

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,360
parties he's well known for

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
culture a lot of history

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
but it is

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
not known for

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
playing a huge role in geopolitical

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
games you know in terms of conflict in

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
terms of defining what happens in

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
different regions and whatnot

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
so coming from this background and from

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
from this type of understanding of the

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
world you can imagine that it was a very

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
big switch when i moved into

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
this world

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
after my time in mexico growing blah

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
blah and careers i ended up moving to

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
united states studying some time in

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
there whatever and eventually got hired

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
for for a role in threat intelligence

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
community particular cyber threat

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
intelligence

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
in uh the area from washington dc

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
where you know a lot of the decisions

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
that happen impacts the world in

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
different ways they know much more about

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
there's much more of this culture uh

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
surrounding like like geopolitics how

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
are we gonna

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,239
influence what's what's happening

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,160
different places how those things are

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
influencing us and generally thinking

80
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
about the world from a very different

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
vision

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
and within that that backgrounds uh you

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
can get even more specific which is when

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
you start thinking about precisely

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
their intelligence

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
estranged intelligence i mean all of the

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,640
ones in here know know already some some

88
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
of it you you're pretty much purely

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
familiar but

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
when you talk with someone outside like

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
just in the street and it's like what do

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
you do and you say like oh threat

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,319
intelligence and they're like whoa can

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
you even talk about it like yeah of

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
course we can because threat

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
intelligence has evolved in such a

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
unique way that maybe many years ago it

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
was what we saw in the movies you know

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,560
like the guy with the hat and super

100
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
secret and

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
uh but recently it's something that also

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
multiple organizations have to do uh you

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,720
know like from the private sector from

104
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,680
from uh non-government organizations

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
basically there's a lot much more going

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
on in the threat intelligence world

107
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,640
and that is basically how we ended up

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
getting this type of information trying

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
to help

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
different organizations different

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
countries people in general to remain

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
safe uh to remain private and and what

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
not

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
so that being said

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
their intelligence is not the only

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
interesting thing in here but also that

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
the time we are living in is quite

118
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
particular

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
these are a series of things that i

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
pulled from twitter that just just

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
random that i find interesting

122
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
um describing what

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
it's not an official term but i always

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
say like like it's kind of like being in

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
another

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
another cold war right

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
where you're seeing different states

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,918
aligning between themselves basically uh

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,440
trying to push different narratives

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,759
engaging on this information engaging on

131
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,400
espionage and shading and cyber attacks

132
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
uh different types you know and in

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
including the physical which i'm going

134
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
to be switching to in a second and

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
actually what you see here is it's very

136
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
interesting it's i mean

137
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
it is fun in in a horrible way but

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
basically the ones from below are

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
basically the responses that permanently

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
happen between the twitter of ukraine

141
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
and official twitter in russia and

142
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
basically they're making this type of

143
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
jokes permanently the one on the left we

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
see uh it's it's from a russian account

145
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
saying like what nato is saying is false

146
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
you know like like a funny bear

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
these are the hackers and from united

148
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
states uh we have this for example from

149
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,479
the u.s i would command where what they

150
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
are doing is exposing

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
specific campaigns specific tools that

152
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
they are that they're running into and

153
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
making some sort of a parody right so it

154
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
uses these flows of information that are

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,880
are telling us there is something going

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
on we are permanently having these type

157
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
of clashes and even though on twitter

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,039
it's very fun and we share them and we

159
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,199
you know we enjoy them the problem is

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,039
that there are much bigger implications

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
and those big implications are precisely

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
when you discuss in terms of the

163
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,120
evolution of what we considered from

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
from cyber security

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
many years ago when you thought about a

166
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,280
computer you were permanently thinking

167
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
about the privacy and then say well it's

168
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
not only privacy but basically privacy

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
integrity availability data you know no

170
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
one should get access if they get access

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,280
to

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
i don't know like your personal

173
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
information what can they do

174
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,199
the information from your organization

175
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,240
would not

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
but actually right now what we're seeing

177
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,000
more uh that i believe is a concern that

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
we should be raising more in these

179
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
communities is the switch towards safety

180
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
safety parenthesis the parenthesis is a

181
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,400
term that does not exist in every

182
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
language

183
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
for example just particularly in spanish

184
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,080
we say seguridad which means security

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
period so that is everything in english

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,479
they have this separation for example

187
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
safety security and the reason to make

188
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,800
this differentiation is security means

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
yeah when there is someone that you know

190
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
tries to uh to attack to basically

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
generate something something negative

192
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
some negative input but particularly in

193
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
safety it matters when

194
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,160
it's basically the main thing we care

195
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
about when we see it from an engineering

196
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
perspective from a process that means

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
more like there could be a physical

198
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
damage to your process to your person uh

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
to your infrastructure

200
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
and so to illustrate like like at that

201
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
to begin like like this illustration of

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
what is going on i have this quick

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
timeline

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,039
uh this timeline is mainly focused on

205
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,440
on big incidents like like the ones that

206
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
catch a lot of attention take years to

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
to study and then we added a bit of like

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
why it's going more dramatic recently

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,800
i'm going to be talking of the three

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
things

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
so the first one stocks it

212
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
is everyone here familiar with stocksnet

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
can you raise your hand if you if you

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
know what it is

215
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,319
okay so so basically it seems like most

216
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,919
most people are familiar for those that

217
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,520
didn't raise a hand it's just a super

218
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
summary uh an attack against an iranian

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
nuclear center refugees

220
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
both seems to be state sponsored and

221
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
then and would not and will basically

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
delay the program for for a long time

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
after they they managed to impact us and

224
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
refugees and delay the process for for

225
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
years

226
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
then we have uh this i'm just gonna

227
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,000
summarize with 2011 through 2016 it's an

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
era where you see more researchers

229
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
disclosing vulnerabilities you start

230
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
seeing some different types of attacks

231
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
you see a couple of power outages in

232
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
ukraine for example where basically they

233
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,599
turn off the light for a couple hours

234
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
some using very complex tools some using

235
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
less complex ones

236
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,080
and then

237
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
eventually we get to 2017. this is the

238
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
case that one of the cases that i'm

239
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,120
going to be talking more about

240
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
i realize that for example most people

241
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
when talk about control systems in this

242
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,319
type of security they think of stocksnet

243
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
but in my opinion triton is the most

244
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
interesting

245
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
question

246
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,919
could you raise your hand if you're

247
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,960
familiar with triton

248
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
a couple okay well that is great because

249
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,039
i'm going to be giving a more of a

250
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,319
description of that one that that's

251
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
actually also like like

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
from from basically from the back ends

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
of what we saw and how how it took place

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
but so basically that that's one of the

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,839
most relevant incidents on from my

256
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,360
perspective then we get to 2019 and

257
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
those are other two things that i'm

258
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,800
going to be covering that is moving from

259
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,519
the

260
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
the perspective of it it has to be a

261
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
nation state

262
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
to actually we care about criminals

263
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
because criminals are generating the

264
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,120
same or similar impacts and then we care

265
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
also about uh basically random people it

266
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
can be a activist it can be a per an

267
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
individual a hacker it can be a small

268
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
group of individuals that decide that

269
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,839
they want to explore this type of of

270
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,920
attacks and then finally 2022 just

271
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
because it's the newest probably they

272
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
will mention something in the next panel

273
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
about ukraine there was in destroyer

274
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
version two basically reuse of tools

275
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
from 2016 to try to turn off multiple

276
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,399
energy facilities in ukraine gladly it

277
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,720
was stopped as much as we can

278
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
as we can tell

279
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
and in controller which is a big set of

280
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,839
tools

281
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
not necessarily related to ukraine but

282
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
disclosure at the same time particularly

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
to impact a couple sets of of control

284
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
systems i'm going to briefly mention

285
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
both of those

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
so to jump into this anthology how i

287
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
call it of tails

288
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
i will separate it in three parts let's

289
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
go to the first one which is the nation

290
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,519
state one

291
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,600
for the nation state one the first thing

292
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,519
to mention here is

293
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,480
this quote which i love from uh from a

294
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
report from siemens a couple years ago

295
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
what they were doing is they were

296
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
reporting about cyber security for oil

297
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
and gas and they were saying you know

298
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,360
come with us our products are are good

299
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,519
you know we are trying we're focused on

300
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,000
security and then what they highlighted

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
was uh how organizations in specific

302
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
sectors are being in the crossfire

303
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
of different organizations that are

304
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
trying to

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
impact each other so what you see is a

306
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
ton of organizations doing a lot of

307
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
espionage

308
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
then you see that a couple of cyber

309
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,720
attacks the couple big ones that you saw

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
and the reason why this is so important

311
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
is because all of these espionage that

312
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,200
they do gather information about the

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
processes how do you

314
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
generate the

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
your product how do you share your

316
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
product what type of network do you have

317
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
what type of engineering background do

318
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
you have basically who is the people

319
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,560
working for you

320
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
all of that you need it when you want to

321
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,480
go and attack something as not simple as

322
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
this

323
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
and so

324
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
having that background we can go to the

325
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
first story time which is triton

326
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
precisely the one i was mentioning

327
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
in a nutshell what triton is is uh

328
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
basically a

329
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,279
state-sponsored attack

330
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
against um energy facility in the middle

331
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
east

332
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,480
happened in 2017 but took at least since

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
well the first time we we were able to

334
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,839
track activity was back to 2014.

335
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,920
um and what was the most interesting

336
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
thing in this case uh is basically how

337
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
it happened is

338
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
all of a sudden uh mandiants

339
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
they reach out to to our organization

340
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
and they say hey you know we need

341
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,920
your help for a response incident

342
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
something's happening in the in the

343
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
facility it's turning off uh they go

344
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
they start checking and then they they

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
find this super complex situation

346
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
where

347
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
the most unique thing was not the full

348
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,959
attack the full cyber attack the full

349
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,680
cycle but actually the last step that it

350
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
was a very complicated very

351
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,680
sophisticated piece of malware that was

352
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,160
specifically trying to target something

353
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
that i hope

354
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
well probably no one has heard about has

355
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,399
anyone here heard about the triconics

356
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
safety instrumented system

357
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
two people great

358
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,000
well triconic safety instrumented system

359
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
is basically the last line of defense

360
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
in terms of safety is basically once

361
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
that you modify a process that you

362
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
figure out how to modify the process and

363
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
then you want to turn off this this

364
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,800
second alarm that that says you know

365
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
something's going on just a turn off

366
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
because you know

367
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
otherwise there's going to be an

368
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
accident

369
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
well that is what the safety controller

370
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,600
does and then the attacker

371
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
was already compromising the safety

372
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
controller which means they had

373
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
everything they needed to go all the way

374
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
through through basically a i call it

375
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,360
physical attack but basically

376
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
destruction

377
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
to give an idea of how the attack looks

378
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,320
like because i know that beyond you know

379
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
to go a bit beyond uh

380
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
just just the anecdotal perspective but

381
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
like the sophistication of the attack

382
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
what you see up on there is basically

383
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
well the attacker came up from uh it

384
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
basically this is how we understand from

385
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,959
from the control systems operational

386
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
technology we understand the world using

387
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,160
this

388
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
diagram ish that's called a purdue model

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
and it shows basically that's the

390
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
corporate network where most of the

391
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
computers are then you start getting

392
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,959
more specific there's a the military

393
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
zone that separates your control systems

394
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
from from it world and then you get this

395
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
distributed control systems controls the

396
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
process finally this safety instrumented

397
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,920
system

398
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,200
what's very interesting here is that the

399
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
attacker was able to go all through that

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,399
process

401
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
and how they were doing it was actually

402
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
very interesting

403
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
because the person that was trying to do

404
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
this series of compromises using tools

405
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,279
that are known others that are not known

406
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
making small modifications

407
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,839
they were testing the tools in in known

408
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
malware analysis sandboxes

409
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
and then they would test the tool they

410
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
would deploy

411
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
if you know there a certain number of

412
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
antivirus organizations caught it then

413
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
they would continue testing and when

414
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
they finally got a zero detection they

415
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
go and they deploy and that is how

416
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
little by little over this period of

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
long period of time eventually they get

418
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
all the way to the safety instrumented

419
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
system and there there's a very

420
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
different story about someone who

421
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
somehow developed this very

422
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,639
sophisticated malware for targeting a

423
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,639
type of controller that actually if you

424
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
want to get access to one now we know

425
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
you can do it probably from ebay buy an

426
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
old one but normally it's it's not not

427
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
something you can get access to and

428
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
there is no public information about the

429
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
protocol no

430
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
public information about how to work

431
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,240
with these devices it's fairly specific

432
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
so the three use cases for here the

433
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
reason why this was so concerning is

434
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
because we started analyzing you have

435
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
like everything that happens and then

436
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,320
you say what is it that they want to do

437
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
with all of this and there are three

438
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
possible alternatives none of which

439
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
sounded very happy

440
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,519
the first one was i just stopped the

441
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,399
process

442
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,680
because if i

443
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
trigger one of the alerts from the

444
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,959
safety intermediate system it's gonna

445
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,639
say hey there's something wrong with the

446
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,800
process let's stop i don't wanna blow up

447
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,680
cool

448
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,480
okay

449
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
that that's the easiest

450
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,839
the second one is i'm going to reprogram

451
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,399
it so that it like the plant can go to

452
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,959
an unsafe state so let's say that if i

453
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
don't want ever my process to get to i

454
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
don't know 50 degrees then i'm going to

455
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,720
program it so that it allows up to 60

456
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,040
degrees so that if in the future i want

457
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,399
to come back and i want to make a

458
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,880
modification this safety controller is

459
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
not going to trigger and then the plant

460
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,959
is again going to end up in a bad

461
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
situation and then the last one which is

462
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
the most aggressive is you have all the

463
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,160
access to the network you have all all

464
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
the process you have been you basically

465
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
own the the network from the

466
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
organization

467
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
so what you could do is actually uh you

468
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
reprogram the sis so that it can be

469
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,959
unsafe and also you modify from the

470
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
control system distributed control

471
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
system how we call basically just

472
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
basically how you're interacting with

473
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
the process you modify the process so

474
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,160
you bring it to this unsafe state so you

475
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,319
force this type of physical attack

476
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,000
and so

477
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,199
i know some people don't like

478
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
attribution some people do there are

479
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
multiple reasons on my perspective

480
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
attribution more than

481
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
a specific state it means basically that

482
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
that you can group the indicators and

483
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,360
have a technical understanding of the

484
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
author but in this case

485
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,959
the reason why i bring it up is because

486
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,440
it was a very interesting case normally

487
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,600
uh it is a bit more well it is always

488
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,680
difficult to do this type of work but

489
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
in this case there were some mistakes

490
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
from the actor that were the ones that

491
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,720
allowed the researchers to actually go

492
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
and figure out what happened i'm going

493
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
to mention the specific mistakes but

494
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
basically the attack was attributed to a

495
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
nation-state

496
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,600
sponsored laboratory

497
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
even you know going back to a specific

498
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
location and whatnot

499
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,199
and to do this we had to do all this

500
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
crazy work i'm actually just gonna step

501
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
in directly

502
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,000
uh this is how it looks like if we

503
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,519
wanted to do the equivalent of those pin

504
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
maps you know like how you like like the

505
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
meme that you just like

506
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,800
what is all this it makes no sense well

507
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
basically there were three

508
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
lines that we used to get this

509
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
attribution uh there's full talks about

510
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,759
this but right now i'm just going to

511
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,839
give it a summarized version basically

512
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,360
one ip address

513
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
that wasn't really

514
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
really masked it was directly registered

515
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,319
for the organization

516
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,480
that was used to connect to multiple

517
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,880
other organizations suffering

518
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,439
in similar type of industries

519
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
which was used to go and look at our

520
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,480
blog posts every time where we were

521
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
we were publishing

522
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,400
which was also used to deploy the actual

523
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
attack

524
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
and was also used by this mysterious

525
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,799
person

526
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,440
uh this mysterious person is uh

527
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
someone that was involved in doing this

528
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
testing with the sandboxes and one day

529
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
by mistake they left a very unique

530
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
handle in a pdv path

531
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,080
and then based on that very unique

532
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,400
handle from the path then we were able

533
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
to identify

534
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,679
where the individual was coming from

535
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,400
what it was whatever that's that's where

536
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
you stop as soon as a private

537
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,880
organization

538
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
you know it becomes a work from someone

539
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,799
else but then you were able to connect

540
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
the fact that yes uh

541
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
this is who's doing it uh this is where

542
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,559
it's coming from and then you connect

543
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
with other more opportunists not

544
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
opportunistic

545
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
less high quality indicators like

546
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,960
basically the languages that are being

547
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
used and when the activity is taking

548
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,679
place

549
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,120
based on all of that we were able to

550
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,600
connect where it was coming from

551
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
and uh well basically make the

552
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
assessment of yeah to make

553
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
it's a no-brainer that to make something

554
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
so complicated you need resources you

555
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
need a big team and you need to have

556
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
them working permanently so

557
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,799
knowing all the details might take years

558
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
or maybe are never going to be all known

559
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
but at least this gave a picture of what

560
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,919
it was

561
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
and just i mean of course this was uh

562
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,559
gladly verified some some years later

563
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
actually this is i believe uh from

564
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
earlier this year

565
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
basically just that the department of

566
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
justice in u.s uh

567
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,440
issued an indictment for some of the

568
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
individuals involved in in this and

569
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,440
other activity uh basically triton was

570
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
one of the big of the big reasons why

571
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
they they were able to push this

572
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
and well i mean it's just just good to

573
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
see how the full story

574
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
closed in

575
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,280
basically the full circle was closed

576
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,320
now that is

577
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
in my opinion probably the most

578
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
impactful in in terms of like it is very

579
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
obvious that you see the

580
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
oh okay um did you see

581
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,400
that

582
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
there was this intentionality for you

583
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
know physical attack that they did

584
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,679
something super complex that there are

585
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
resources getting in place into trying

586
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
to lose attacks such as they happened

587
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
before

588
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,679
one in you in

589
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,120
different ones right

590
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
but then

591
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
the hot news that i was mentioning were

592
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,240
the 2022 cases

593
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
it just continues happening which is the

594
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
reason why i believe this is more

595
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
important right now than ever to start

596
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,799
bringing into discussion and to start

597
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,520
trying to get more people involved into

598
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
um because yeah we saw fairly similarly

599
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
complicated cases the case you see in

600
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,880
there in controller is a full diagram of

601
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
the attack never took place it's it's a

602
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,080
set of tools

603
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,640
um and we when we got b civilian to that

604
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
set of tools we decided to place how it

605
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,600
would look like in the full attack

606
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,799
lifecycle

607
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,440
and then this is a full module that

608
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,039
targets a very specific again a very

609
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,559
specific company very specific

610
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,120
controllers very specific processes same

611
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
for this one

612
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
this one is omron for those that are

613
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,840
familiar that one was

614
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
schneider electric

615
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
and then this is for opc ua which is

616
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,679
basically a protocol that we use to

617
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
communicate all the process data but

618
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
then when you put all that together it

619
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,679
these these tools actually gave you like

620
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,120
like the full capability of doing a

621
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
similar attack

622
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,159
more simple than triton but actually

623
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
very beautifully written in such a way

624
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,159
that i'm pretty sure

625
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,600
whomever was doing it wanted to do

626
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
something like this

627
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
which is um this is just a module from

628
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
old malware

629
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
that was deployed in ukraine

630
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,280
trying to turn off the lights during the

631
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
beginning of the conflict

632
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,840
and then what's very interesting here is

633
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,240
uh they when they deploy this tool it it

634
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
basically communicates with a very

635
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,600
specific protocol and what they do in

636
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
here is they go and modify uh

637
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
specifically some processes they modify

638
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
the ip addresses which mean that they

639
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
already know at least some about the

640
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,400
target and where they're gonna go

641
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
and then they try to deploy and then

642
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
hopefully turn off the power and i

643
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,080
repeat it didn't happen but we got a

644
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,520
couple of samples in here and that's

645
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
basically well literally a couple we got

646
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,240
one and there's a public one in case

647
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,159
you're curious about about this malware

648
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
and so that is all from the nation state

649
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
perspective i think that's that's the

650
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,600
most serious the most concerning i'll

651
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
get back to discussing that just like

652
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
from a high level

653
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,679
but i prefer to begin with that just

654
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,000
because it's kind of like like a bit low

655
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
lower in uh

656
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,799
yeah i know that it's kind of like a

657
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,640
very serious topic

658
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
so i wanted to jump to show that it is

659
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
actually more simple than what we're

660
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
just seeing and even though nation

661
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
states are involved in that and it's

662
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,840
already

663
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
complicated there are more people who

664
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
can't do it

665
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
and so this is the story from uh

666
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,919
particularly criminals

667
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,360
the main the first time we started

668
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
thinking about it was ransomware and

669
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,159
you're going to be more familiar

670
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,320
probably with these stories but now i'm

671
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,440
going to tell them just from a different

672
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,559
perspective so that you see the

673
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
implications and how they were analyzed

674
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,600
for people

675
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
in the the ot space

676
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
the first time we ever cared about this

677
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,480
is i know the ransomware's goals goes

678
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
even beyond this watch me on this but

679
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
the first time that we cared was during

680
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
the wannacry then not petty and then you

681
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,520
know

682
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
and the reason why we we cared is

683
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
because for the first time we saw

684
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
industrial organizations uh i say

685
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,320
industrial but in this case for example

686
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,919
you might be familiar with the big case

687
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
of maersk

688
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
you know the

689
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
say basically cargo shipping and whatnot

690
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,600
and basically what happened with this

691
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
type of ransomware is you know it was

692
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,320
deployed it started spreading everywhere

693
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
and then they realized that

694
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,880
since they are now using more computers

695
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
to coordinate all of these processes

696
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,760
physical and non-physical then basically

697
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
nothing was working and then you can get

698
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
the trucks in and then you can get them

699
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
out and then you cannot load the cargo

700
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
and then you cannot know what is in each

701
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,480
container and you know like it made

702
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
a very big impact it was millions and

703
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,919
millions and millions

704
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
and beyond that basically of course you

705
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,799
can't

706
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,960
you can support the service of

707
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
transferring these goods

708
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
but then this was just an isolated case

709
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,080
and normally ransomware wasn't really

710
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
wasn't really in our radar it was like

711
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
oh it matters and some people will be

712
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
like ah it's boring everyone knows it

713
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
it's it's simple

714
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
but then

715
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,720
we started seeing something different

716
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
um and then it's what this evolution

717
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
that that's known as well it's known as

718
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,159
post compromise ransomware by by

719
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,640
mandiant i think microsoft refers to it

720
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
as uh

721
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,280
targeted malware something like that

722
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
sorry targeted run somewhere there are

723
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
different names but basically

724
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
what we saw is when actors started doing

725
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,640
something more more involvement right

726
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
that the actor itself

727
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
uh does engage in the full process and

728
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
it's not something just like a worm that

729
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
it's going to be spreading and seeing

730
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,159
what it can destroy but actually that

731
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,080
there's an actor that knows that the

732
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
most they can damage the process the

733
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,760
most they can

734
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,840
make life difficult for the victim then

735
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
the most likely they're going to win

736
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
and the first time one of the first

737
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
times when we saw an organization come

738
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
out publicly with this it was norsk

739
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,240
hydro

740
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
they were super specific around the

741
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
lucifer's i might be inventing a word

742
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
but basically they were super clear

743
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
about this in in media and would not

744
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,440
they decided to go fully and say yes we

745
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,840
had an attack this is what happened and

746
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
what happened was mainly that it

747
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
impacted some of their databases and

748
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
since they produce aluminium but it goes

749
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,279
all over the world

750
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,120
it's a ton it's gigantic they don't know

751
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
where the pieces are they don't know how

752
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
to continue and since they lost all this

753
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,559
information about customers who's paid

754
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,840
what are they paying for what are they

755
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
ordering where is it going and all of

756
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,200
this is connected with the actual

757
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
physical process then basically they

758
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
were lost and they were like okay well

759
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,400
right now we can produce we're gonna

760
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,919
have a very hard time

761
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
and well that's basically what happened

762
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,960
it was it was another very big case and

763
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
from here basically this is what we are

764
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,960
going to be continuing to see uh this is

765
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
nothing that that happened once or twice

766
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,240
it's something that is happening every

767
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
time more often and we see it in the

768
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
news we read there was disney ransomware

769
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
and then probably from our perspective

770
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
it means like well

771
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,240
yeah just one more it's terrible but

772
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
actually the impact that it can happen

773
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
that it is having it's much larger and

774
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
mainly when you actually combine it also

775
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
with you know strategic techniques like

776
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,000
like like in the beginning you know like

777
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
with the geopolitics of it

778
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
um

779
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
so another case

780
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
maritime advisory again they were

781
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
starting to learn that this was possible

782
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
still like like it took years the reason

783
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
why i'm bringing this up as in years is

784
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,880
because even though there are many cases

785
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,520
it took years for people in this

786
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
engineering and ot type of community to

787
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
accept that this was actually a threat

788
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
and it's no wonder because it's two

789
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,520
separate worlds that have been getting

790
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
you know much closer together but you

791
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
know up until now it was something like

792
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,240
you know it's not going to affect me

793
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,679
just computers

794
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,120
and then this mario time advisory what

795
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
it was saying is again there was another

796
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,640
case uh we can't get access basically an

797
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
entirely different case it's just like

798
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,200
access to the to the ports is impossible

799
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,799
uh so the process is getting very

800
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,919
difficult again we cannot go we cannot

801
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,159
continue with our production

802
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,440
and you can see many different cases of

803
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
course you can see

804
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,640
this is a very random one johannesburg

805
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,760
city power basically uh energy for

806
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,520
customers all of a sudden you cannot

807
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
receive energy because they decided to

808
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,520
drop the ransomware on the date when you

809
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,559
have to pay

810
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,240
and then if you can't pay you don't

811
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
receive energy and your payment is

812
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,799
automated via your service and there is

813
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,039
no service so basically you can't pay so

814
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,320
you lose your energy and the

815
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
organization didn't know what to do

816
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
another example uh prosecutor this was

817
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,840
uh it's a security

818
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,919
um security type appliances

819
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,159
alarms basically again your alarms turn

820
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,080
off nothing you can do about it it

821
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,840
affected multiple customers

822
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,039
this is just to show like like the

823
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,480
different types of impacts you know like

824
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
like it can be as big as lack of energy

825
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,679
it can be lack of water it can be

826
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,720
uh

827
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
in these cases you know something like

828
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
you can't pay it can be but but in the

829
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,840
end it's having an impact in in your

830
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,240
daily life

831
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
and the bigger one probably this the

832
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,080
last series i have around somewhere is

833
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,120
um

834
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,600
the colonial pipeline it was 2021 that's

835
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
when they accepted and they said yes

836
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
right now i have to do something

837
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,200
everyone go and look for ransomware

838
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
and this was basically oil and gas

839
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,679
distribution in in the us

840
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,440
the attack didn't actually impact ot or

841
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,120
you know like production systems but

842
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
what it actually did was you know it was

843
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
it was in such a way that that the

844
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
organization and the indian response and

845
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,840
were not considered that it was a good

846
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,080
idea to stop the process temporarily to

847
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,919
make sure that nothing was going to

848
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,039
spread

849
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,360
because if it was to spread into the

850
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
control system the impact would be much

851
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,320
more massive it could be a lot of time

852
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
that users would not get access to gas

853
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,720
this was a big impact in u.s because in

854
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,960
the area where this organization was

855
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,679
operating uh well yeah there was

856
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,720
basically

857
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,960
gas shortages for a period of time

858
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,640
and even though this is a united state

859
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
case you know i mean it could be as a

860
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,679
simple earlier this year there were some

861
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,799
cases here uh in imports in europe which

862
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,559
which is like from a theoretical

863
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,919
perspective you analyze that you have

864
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,559
some of the biggest ports in this

865
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
similar area where you have for example

866
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
hamburg you drop two or three ports from

867
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,120
there

868
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
and you know sharing things you know

869
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
communicating is going to be super

870
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
difficult

871
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
anyway

872
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,360
but just to keep the notes a bit higher

873
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
i'm just going to say it has gotten

874
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
worse when they mess up with your beer

875
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
that's something that we normally do not

876
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
considered appropriate

877
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,799
and also here uh there was this case

878
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
backer logistic

879
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
and basically you know we couldn't get

880
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
cheese in albert time so those of you

881
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
that are from here you might understand

882
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
the trauma

883
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,559
and it was basically because they could

884
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,720
not uh continue with this uh the

885
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,159
distribution of the cheese for for a

886
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,600
couple of weeks but anyway those are

887
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,520
more more like on a happy note but

888
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
all of this the point is

889
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,000
it's not uh a couple cases we're talking

890
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
about thousands

891
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,200
uh what we did for this experiment which

892
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,039
is actually interesting is it does not

893
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
depend on the visibility of an

894
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
organization but what it actually

895
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,760
depends on is

896
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
we went directly to the ransomware

897
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
shaming sites where they go and they

898
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,159
drop the leaks after compromising the

899
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,720
organization and then we gather all that

900
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,399
information and then that's how we

901
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,240
generate these numbers

902
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
we filtered specifically for industries

903
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
that we consider that might be using

904
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,679
this type of physical processes

905
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,039
and then that's how we got to this

906
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
number of 2021 around 13 1300.

907
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
of course we continue seeing more 2022

908
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
has been the same or bigger larger

909
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,559
surprise

910
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,159
and also we highlight that you know it's

911
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,679
not only like small companies because

912
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,760
some people believe well if you're small

913
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
and you don't have budget for security

914
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,279
of course you're gonna get popped but

915
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,120
actually there's also some very large

916
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
ones here i mean well this is about a

917
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
thousand about ten thousand employees

918
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,360
uh basically you know all type of

919
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
organizations are the ones that are

920
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,200
being impacted by this type of

921
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,760
of activity

922
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,200
but this is fine i

923
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,799
if anyone went to my other talk you

924
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,200
already saw this i just love it too much

925
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,360
the author gave me allowed to use this

926
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
in in this type of environment

927
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
but uh yeah the point is is i mean of

928
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
course this is terrible

929
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
um but yeah i mean all of us are dealing

930
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
with that and and the point in here is

931
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
just to bring up about this additional

932
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,559
implication that we have from the

933
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,840
physical world

934
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,679
as to see how we can work together to

935
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,159
see how you can solve it from a physical

936
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
and from an i.t perspective

937
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
all of this uh i think i should have

938
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
placed this earlier but the point is

939
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
just uh the reason why it's getting so

940
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,720
complicated as well if

941
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,039
for those that are not as into this

942
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
specific world is

943
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
how it's getting more complex for for

944
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,960
all of these groups um basically the

945
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,559
fact is that you don't have a single

946
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
individual or a single group doing it

947
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,159
this type of ransomware deployment

948
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,559
anymore but rather different cells uh it

949
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,840
might be some people doing initial

950
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
access offering it selling it

951
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,039
distributing

952
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
someone else develops this panel so that

953
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
you can go and charge for the money and

954
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
communicate with the victim some other

955
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
group might be doing moving across

956
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,159
organization network using the same

957
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
techniques that the nation state actors

958
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,120
used for deploying triton or whatnot

959
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,799
so that is actually another big point

960
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,519
that

961
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
if you consider what these actors are

962
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
able to do right now

963
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,080
well it should be a big alert because

964
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,640
they are super close uh to the point

965
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
where they can generate again

966
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,360
willingly or unwillingly the type of

967
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,480
impact that we don't want in the

968
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,399
physical world

969
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
but that is all from from ransomware

970
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,480
again i'm gonna go another layer a bit

971
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,279
more more simple uh just you know to go

972
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,919
from the from the worst to

973
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
a place where we can chill a bit and so

974
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,559
i have a couple more stories these ones

975
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,960
go on the on the layer of other type of

976
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,519
actors not nation states uh not not

977
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,360
organized criminals just a random

978
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,039
individual it could be any one of us in

979
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,399
here it could be our friends it could be

980
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,480
our acquaintances hopefully not but it

981
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
could

982
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,559
um

983
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,159
and then we have this what we call low

984
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,240
sophistication type of attacks

985
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,519
this one is interesting because it

986
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,039
happened a couple

987
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,200
a couple weeks ago and basically it was

988
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,840
uh apparently this this actor claimed on

989
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,559
twitter to have popped this uh

990
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,519
iranian uh steel production facility

991
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,600
they shared some videos that's actually

992
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,519
if you go you can find it probably i

993
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,960
don't know if they took it down but for

994
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,399
a while it was there

995
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,480
uh and then that's a video of what the

996
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,720
impact happened actually in the facility

997
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
here there are some machine interfaces

998
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,159
of how you interact actually with the

999
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,720
process and they the point in here was

1000
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
to say like hey you know we want to show

1001
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
that we are terrible we want to show

1002
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,880
that we hate you so we go and we do this

1003
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
to your facility they were super nice to

1004
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
say that they do it carefully not to

1005
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
impact any individual who knows um and

1006
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,919
we can't even verify they actually did

1007
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,600
this or not because obviously it's a bit

1008
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,279
of more obscure to get this type of

1009
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,679
information but you know there is like

1010
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,120
like the type of thing that it can

1011
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,639
happen from less sophisticated actors

1012
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
this is another one this is uh florida

1013
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,240
um old smile florida a case where an

1014
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
attacker gained access to a water

1015
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,000
treatment facility

1016
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,480
and basically what they did was modify

1017
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,320
the chemicals in the water

1018
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
so that uh it would become basically

1019
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
dangerous for the for the individual

1020
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
the attacker wasn't very skillful uh

1021
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,240
what they did wasn't you know super

1022
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,679
calculated and whatever but they got

1023
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,600
access and literally they modified the

1024
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,519
chemicals up to the top which means that

1025
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,640
obviously they're gonna be alarms and

1026
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,840
there's gonna be people looking at

1027
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
what's going on but the attacker wasn't

1028
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
aware of this

1029
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,440
so very quickly the operator fixed it no

1030
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
one died no problem but just for the fun

1031
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,880
of figuring out what could have happened

1032
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,799
uh we have this exercise this is a

1033
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,640
chemistry exercise for students in in

1034
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,600
college

1035
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,799
based on this

1036
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,159
that what it said is like let's

1037
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,159
calculate what happened with the ph

1038
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
of the water if

1039
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
this had succeeded

1040
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
and basically it moves from uh from

1041
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,799
around the i believe it should be around

1042
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
here like seven nine that you can drink

1043
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
it was all the way to 13.

1044
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
so would you what can happen to your

1045
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,159
your stomach if that happens basically

1046
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,039
uh

1047
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,360
i encourage you to look for it in google

1048
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,279
if you don't want to sleep tonight it's

1049
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,480
really horrible

1050
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
but yeah it just it basically can be

1051
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,320
super damaging for for an individual

1052
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,159
but the point is

1053
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,239
when you go with these actors that are

1054
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,960
not as you know experienced and whatever

1055
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
it doesn't have to be that serious we

1056
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,839
also have a couple a couple funny

1057
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,879
stories

1058
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,199
um

1059
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,040
and this is the first one

1060
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,800
i don't know if anyone here is familiar

1061
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,679
with if i say a gas system

1062
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,520
and i ask is anyone here familiar with

1063
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
what a gas system is

1064
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
i'm glad because who knows right i mean

1065
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,879
a gas system could be whatever uh well

1066
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,560
these guys just apologies and they said

1067
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
we compromised this gas system

1068
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,599
in israel and it is because

1069
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,280
we basically hate them whatever they are

1070
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
doing too many people what not

1071
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,159
and then

1072
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,839
we're gonna make we're gonna make

1073
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,760
everything burn

1074
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
we started looking at this and what we

1075
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,440
did was a different approach is just

1076
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
look what is it that they actually had

1077
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
access to because it's very relevant if

1078
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,640
they are actually doing it

1079
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,800
um by looking a bit into

1080
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,480
this it was very funny but we just

1081
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,839
started looking at some keywords like

1082
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,599
dumpers i don't know if anyone dumpers

1083
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,079
system or damper or we started looking

1084
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,520
also for the ipe more or less the

1085
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,119
location things like that

1086
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,640
and basically it turned out to be a

1087
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,880
kitchen this was a kitchen appliance it

1088
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,560
was basically you know hvac for a

1089
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
kitchen

1090
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
uh but you know i mean it's interesting

1091
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,320
that they are getting access to these

1092
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
things but also you know gladly it's not

1093
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,440
so simple yet

1094
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,520
a second case was this one which is an

1095
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,359
act to say i have access to a rail

1096
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,359
system from germany which sounds fairly

1097
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,280
concerning but then when we go and look

1098
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
into it basically by doing a reverse

1099
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
image look up into this it turned out to

1100
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,280
be a model train a toy uh it sounded

1101
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,760
very concerning obviously it wasn't

1102
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
it's interesting that it was connected

1103
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,079
to internet they could have you know

1104
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,839
modified the toy train but definitely

1105
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,839
much less concerning more like an

1106
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,560
interesting story

1107
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,480
and then the last case that i have for

1108
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,280
this one is uh refinery

1109
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
uh

1110
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,359
these groups just drop these uh

1111
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,560
interfaces

1112
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
and then they drop basically the list of

1113
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,839
what the service is what is it that they

1114
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,599
are doing what they do is they look for

1115
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,280
this protocol b and c they look what

1116
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,440
panels are controlled and basically they

1117
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
say we have a refinery so of course we

1118
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,760
go and validate and the refinery was a

1119
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,359
peak feeder

1120
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,880
well you can choose your animals also

1121
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,119
for horses and what not but basically

1122
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,760
much more simple than it could have been

1123
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
so the point with this third with this

1124
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
third set of stories is more about the

1125
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
fact that there are actors actually

1126
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,839
learning about this

1127
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
well this is not very impactful most of

1128
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,680
the times probably in the first one not

1129
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,960
on the others

1130
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
there is people that is trying to learn

1131
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
how to do this that does not require as

1132
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,079
many resources as the nation state or as

1133
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
a criminal and in the end that's how

1134
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,520
they begun

1135
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
uh there's actually another report that

1136
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,320
we have from from

1137
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
nation state asking for information a

1138
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,079
full research from a consultancy of of

1139
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,880
how do you do this type of minor attacks

1140
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,720
uh which also shows basically you know

1141
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,640
like like this appetite for learning how

1142
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,118
to do them

1143
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
but that being said um

1144
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,720
those were the stories in general like

1145
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,920
like to share a bit of what we're seeing

1146
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,119
from the physical world from this

1147
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,760
connection the type of threats uh type

1148
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
of concerns we are we are sharing the

1149
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,720
type of things we want to encourage you

1150
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
to go and and also look into

1151
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,560
um

1152
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,440
but just to discuss the the high level

1153
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,320
implications like what does this mean

1154
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,839
what you want to take home is first of

1155
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,960
all

1156
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
on a high level

1157
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,400
where is this coming from

1158
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,599
um

1159
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,400
for many years there we have had this

1160
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
this uh idea that

1161
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,359
technology is um

1162
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,720
basically the more we incorporate

1163
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,079
computers the more we incorporate the

1164
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,760
clever things the more we make things

1165
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,079
smart and what not uh you know the best

1166
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,520
we're gonna we're gonna be a society the

1167
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
more problems we're gonna solve uh this

1168
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
goes in hand for example for with uh

1169
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
wrestle like like united nations pushes

1170
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,119
all these uh theories on detail

1171
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,320
inclusion let's get everyone to a

1172
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,440
computer then everyone's gonna live

1173
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
better and whatnot

1174
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,240
all of this is true it's perfectly true

1175
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,839
but the problem is that we should also

1176
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,440
be considering about what might be the

1177
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,800
implications

1178
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
when you connect these computers to the

1179
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
physical processes that before used to

1180
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,800
run you know directly from from from an

1181
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,839
engineering

1182
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,800
perspective then

1183
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,079
you need to start thinking about what

1184
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,839
are the implications

1185
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,599
and then we need to also start thinking

1186
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,520
about different ways that we can which

1187
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,880
we can make these these connections

1188
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
clever because it is going to happen the

1189
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
vendors are going to do it but we need

1190
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
to think actually what are the

1191
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680
implications and what can we do about it

1192
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,599
and that is you know where there's our

1193
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,839
role

1194
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,520
if we don't do that which is the reason

1195
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,839
why i bring also the scary cases

1196
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,000
well several things can happen uh

1197
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
because there is interest from states

1198
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,720
from criminals and from random people to

1199
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
try to play with these systems that

1200
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
control physical processes

1201
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
and sometimes as you saw it can be model

1202
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
trained it can be

1203
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
hitting it can be something you know

1204
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
very very small

1205
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,599
arguably but it can also be something

1206
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,520
extremely concerning like in the case of

1207
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,119
these energy facilities like in the case

1208
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
of a water facility like those are

1209
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,800
things that basically you do not want

1210
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,359
people messing up with be it state beat

1211
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,040
individual b crime

1212
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,280
and that's something that

1213
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
is not really being as explored as it

1214
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,919
should

1215
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
and the final thing is uh

1216
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,240
there is definitely a lot of interest in

1217
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
trying to stop this type of activity but

1218
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
where i'm seeing it the most uh where

1219
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,800
i'm seeing the most interest is

1220
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,400
at different levels more like like at

1221
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
big organizations governments and

1222
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,079
whatnot that they say we should stop

1223
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,079
fielder your favorite nation state your

1224
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
favorite organization from developing

1225
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,800
attacks for physical infrastructure

1226
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,680
but i do not see actually uh you know

1227
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,440
from more on the individual community

1228
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,960
how are we going to solve this type of

1229
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,680
challenge what ideas do we have how can

1230
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,079
we bring this into into the community

1231
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,839
you know beyond of this high level

1232
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,800
government type of perspective

1233
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
and that is the reason why uh

1234
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
yeah just to wrap up and finish this

1235
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
transition

1236
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,319
the last thing i have is what you can do

1237
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,160
what i'm encouraging what i'm asking for

1238
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,079
to make it very clear is

1239
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,079
uh first of all i share this just out of

1240
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,680
interest it's it has been very

1241
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
interesting to learn about all these

1242
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,520
things actually build a lot of that

1243
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,880
there's very few people that start

1244
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,319
getting visibility into this until it

1245
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,760
gets public all of this is public and

1246
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
verifiable

1247
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,480
but i mean

1248
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,839
it has been also very interesting and

1249
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,760
then it's very nice to share it but also

1250
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,839
we definitely want to get more people

1251
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,040
involved we definitely want your

1252
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
interest if you're working with

1253
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
web security

1254
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,920
well what about thinking about web

1255
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
security for industrial controllers like

1256
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
would you be willing to play with us for

1257
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,480
a bit and see how we can make those work

1258
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
better if you're playing with you know

1259
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
basically whatever you're playing with i

1260
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,079
think that if you have a bit of

1261
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
knowledge in this area if you're curious

1262
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,599
if you want to start playing we would

1263
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,880
definitely love it

1264
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
and yeah you know basically it's an open

1265
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
field there's a lot of people involved

1266
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,920
in it

1267
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,680
and yeah that's all on my side uh thanks

1268
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
for everything

1269
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,879
i bring this back up

1270
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,920
well thank you daniel for this amazing

1271
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,839
talk it was super interesting i learned

1272
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,440
so many new things

1273
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,599
if anyone has any questions there are

1274
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,319
microphones in the path in the middle so

1275
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,319
if you have any questions walk up to

1276
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,759
those and daniel can answer them

1277
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
two questions one is this microphone on

1278
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,000
yes it is yeah thank you

1279
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,400
have you read at least the intro to red

1280
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,240
storm rising by tom clancy

1281
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,119
didn't know no not really i recommend

1282
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,880
that you read it because that really

1283
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,960
sets out the path to this whole thing

1284
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,240
okay

1285
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,520
what was the name to share the

1286
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
recommendation because the microphone is

1287
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,400
a bit low

1288
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,680
aha it's not working um red storm rising

1289
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
by tom clancy okay recommendation to

1290
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
read uh red storm

1291
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
rising rising

1292
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,079
uh apparently it's a very good for this

1293
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,839
and also to return with another one

1294
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,920
there's another one called sand worm

1295
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
uh

1296
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,200
sandworm the the book it's also very

1297
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
interesting very good it's not really

1298
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
cyber physical but it includes some big

1299
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,640
sections of how this be gone and whatnot

1300
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,920
but also yeah thanks for the

1301
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,960
recommendation i'm definitely gonna go

1302
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,920
for it

1303
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,599
thanks for the recommendation if anyone

1304
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,560
has any questions

1305
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,560
no

1306
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,440
well then give another big applause for

1307
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
daniel

1308
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,839
thank you
