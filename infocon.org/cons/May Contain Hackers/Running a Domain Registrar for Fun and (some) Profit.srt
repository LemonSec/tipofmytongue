[Music]

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,400
here we are in this morning and this is

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
this is promising to get be a really

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,600
interesting session um q

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
came up with a solution for a problem

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
that i personally have

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
uh i i i've run quite a few websites

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
and i always go to one of those

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
commercial

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
registrars and and

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
and of course they sell out

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
they sell out to larger

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,520
firms doing the same stuff and then they

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
triple or quadruple the prices and it's

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,760
pretty hard to get away from that

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
because you've invested quite a bit into

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,360
what's running there

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
and i always hate that

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
and i didn't find a solution for that

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,239
and she did

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
so that's what we're here

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
um but if i read this correctly q

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
then that means that i'm still happy and

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
just a bit an old grumpy man complaining

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
about commercial stuff

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
yeah sorry that's grumpy old man for you

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,280
but you actually found a solution but

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
i'm not sure if if i read this

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
description with all the cur extremely

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,520
cursed details of how exactly one

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
sells and manages a domain if that got

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
you really happy so i'm really curious

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,920
about that so without further ado people

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
queue

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,840
morning everyone it's a surprising

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
amount of people here for 10 o'clock on

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
a saturday i presume you either all went

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
to bed at a reasonable time or aren't

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,159
really awake right now

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
there are two options i'm i'm suspecting

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,759
most of you aren't really awake right

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
now so

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
um you've all come to a talk on internet

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
infrastructure so

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
prepare for some cursed details this is

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
a tweet i saw a couple weeks ago if you

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
can't read it i'll read it out uh the

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,919
first tweet was someone asked me what's

49
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
behind all the doors in the locomotive

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
so i started opening all the doors and

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
explaining it to them until they asked

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,120
me to stop and then the quote tweet is

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
me when someone innocently asks how the

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
internet works and this is what you've

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
all done today you've innocently turned

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,319
up to a talk about how the internet

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
works and i promise you will have

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,959
knowledge you wish you didn't have at

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,360
the end

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
so to start

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
with talking about a domain registrar

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
but really we have to first define what

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,200
even is a domain i mean you probably all

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
have bought domains in the past and i

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
have an idea what is a domain but

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,120
there's a lot more to

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
a domain than may appear from

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
first impressions because you're you're

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
buying an entry in the dns route not in

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
the dns root zone but in the

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
iana dns system

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
but all the business you will need a lot

73
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
more data to go with it to manage all

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,239
the business processes of who owns that

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
identifier in the domain name system

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
so even though you think oh it's just my

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,680
identifier on the internet there's a lot

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
more that happens in the background

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
that needs to happen to be able to keep

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
this system functioning at the scale

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
that it does

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
although sometimes i question how it

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,519
functions given how some of this works

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,480
so

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
starting at the top

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
for how a domain works you have icann

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,599
and ayanna ayanna is a division of icann

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
but didn't used to be some very

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
complicated history behind this but they

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,799
manage

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
various different assignments

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,599
on the internet the two ones that are

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
relevant to us today are dns sac and the

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,680
dns root

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,959
and i i can through iana delegates the

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,760
dns route to different providers

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
which you know which are called top

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
level domains

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
they're generally managed by for-profit

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
entities called registries uh they don't

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,120
sell directly to customers and you have

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
to go via registrar so you can't just go

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
straight up to verisign who own dot com

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,120
and say hello verison can i have a com

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
they won't do that they'll just ghost

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
you you have to go there there are very

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
strict processes for who you have to go

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,199
through to get to to get an entry in dns

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,079
for

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,759
what you want

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
the registrars which is what i am and

112
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,080
what i'm here to talk about sell domains

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
from multiple registries they often

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
bundle other services with the domain

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
and this is the primary customer facing

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
view of the domain name system so you

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,360
probably know the likes of godaddy name

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
cheap whatever and you've probably

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
you'll used at least one of them to go

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
buy a domain and so you you've you've

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
seen how registrars interact with

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
customers but

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,280
why even bother with a registrar if you

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,080
could just go straight to

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
verisign or whoever else controls

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
whichever tld you want and buy the

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
domain you want

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
the the main reasons are the registries

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
are lazy and don't want to deal with

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,840
customers so they offload customer

131
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680
service to the registrars

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
and secondly customers are stupid

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,840
they they don't

134
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
they have no concept of how this works

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
so in general someone buying a domain

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
doesn't they don't need to know how this

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,600
whole

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
chain of icann to the registries to the

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,479
registrar works they can just go to

140
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
their web hosting provider and buy a

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
domain

142
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,720
um

143
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
and then they can the

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
register registrar can talk to all the

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
registries they need for the various top

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
level domains they want so it's

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
consolidates everything in one place and

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
keeps all the customer service in one

149
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,400
place and then icann and the registries

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
are left to do their important technical

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
work of maintaining the internet

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
how do you keep track of all these

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
relationships well there's a system

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
called whois which you probably i'm

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
guessing most people here are familiar

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,759
with who is if you want it's cursed it's

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,240
a terrible protocol we're kind of slowly

158
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
getting rid of it

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
but it's very there's very little

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
standardization but it's effectively

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
just a query language to a database

162
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
where you can send one string of text

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
and get back some more text

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
and this is until relatively recently

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
how we've kept track of all these

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
relationships between the different

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
entities in owning a domain

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,919
but it's

169
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
we're we're working on it now

170
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
as the domain we're working on replacing

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
it with something called rdap

172
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
so as the as the i can community i guess

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,919
is the phrase we're working on replacing

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,440
whois but

175
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,479
we

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
because the it's proving so incredibly

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
difficult to keep track of this

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,199
complicated chain of relationships

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
with the whois protocol which wasn't

180
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
designed for this it was designed in the

181
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,880
70s and

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
doesn't it hasn't quite it's scaled

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
surprisingly well but hasn't quite

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
scaled well enough so how did we get to

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
this ludicrously complicated situation

186
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
so history time

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
um back in

188
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,639
1991 or before 1991 when it was still

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
arpanet and the project of the us

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
government and department of defense

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
the whole domain name system was managed

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,479
by one guy called john postel at the

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
stanford research institute the way this

194
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
was managed is documented in rfc 920 if

195
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,759
you'd like some further reading on

196
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,840
how the domain system used to work and

197
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
how we ended up with the situation that

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
we're in like it's it's a good place to

199
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
start to see how we ended up today

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,240
um

201
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
but this was getting by the 1990s the

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
internet was growing massively

203
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
commercially and this was getting

204
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
impractical for one person at one

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
university to manage the entire domain

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
name system

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
so then in 1991 network solutions ra was

208
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
given a contract by the department of

209
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
defense to run internec

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
which was the first

211
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,160
internet numbers and names registry so

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
they pretty much did

213
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,720
everything that i can and the registry

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
and the registrars do today they just

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,840
ran the whole system and then you could

216
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
get you could ask for domains from them

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
and they were free in those days because

218
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
the department of defense funded this

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
because this was still the us government

220
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,039
project in 1995 the growth of domain

221
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
names at in the commercial area outside

222
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
of military applications

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
was significant was so large that the

224
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
department of defense decided they can

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
no longer fund registrations outside of

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
dot mil

227
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,679
uh so so only military people get free

228
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,039
domains now

229
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
and now that's why you have to pay for

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,958
all your domains and i'm sure you have a

231
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
load of domains that you pay for that

232
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
you absolutely intend to use for a

233
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
project in future and

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
i slowly draining your bank account but

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
that's

236
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
and not the department of defense's bank

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
account now

238
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
and then in 1998 this was again didn't

239
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
scale well so we had to try again

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
and icann was created and this ended the

241
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
monopoly of one company on all domain

242
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,920
names because i can manage the dns root

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
zone and then delegated to different

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
companies to manage

245
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
the registry and registrars and from

246
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
1998 until about 2013 is how we designed

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
the model that we've ended up with today

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
of the three-tier system of how a domain

249
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
name is managed

250
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
in 2016 the department of commerce has

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
had taken over the department of defense

252
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
contract

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
ended its contract with icann so

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
completely handing over control of the

255
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
internet to the private sector it's some

256
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
people don't realize that the us

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
government was involved in internet

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
policy until

259
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
relatively recently 2016 but

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
um that's i guess how weird history

261
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,120
things hang around until someone

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
realizes oh we should probably fix that

263
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
and sub-note to all of this country

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
co-top-level domains have been doing

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
their own thing since the beginning

266
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
because these were always delegated to

267
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,399
the country and not to specific

268
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,920
companies although the country often

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
then delegates it on to a company so

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,279
country code top level domains are

271
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
things like dot d e dot n l dot u k

272
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,600
um

273
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
instead of the generic top level domains

274
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,920
like dot

275
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,680
com.net.org whatever which are entirely

276
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,160
privately run whereas country code top

277
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
level domains are often

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
sometimes privately run sometimes run by

279
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,880
the government sometimes run at cost by

280
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
private entity for the government

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
it's it's a bit of a mess every cctld

282
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
has its own rules and it's very annoying

283
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,680
to deal with so back in about 20

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
the start of 2020 in the lockdown i had

285
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
nothing to do and i thought

286
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
i wonder if i could start my own domain

287
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
registrar and then went and did that

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,680
this was a mistake

289
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,720
it's taken up so much of my time and

290
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
i've i've enjoyed it but i recommend

291
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
don't don't do it yourself it

292
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
can can get very unfun at times so step

293
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
one is get a company which is thankfully

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,120
quite easy in the uk

295
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
most registrar's registries won't talk

296
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
to you unless you are a company some

297
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
will take individuals and late and at

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
the end they'll get on to how you might

299
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
what how you might be able to do this

300
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
yourself

301
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,000
if you'd like to

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,959
um

303
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,720
but in general you need a company

304
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
thankfully it's easy in the uk i send

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,920
about 12 pounds to the government and

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
then a few hours later a company exists

307
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
so then i can start getting access to

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,519
registries this is an annoying bit

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,440
because this isn't documented anywhere

310
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
how you get access to registries you

311
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
just have to look up say who owns.com

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
and try and find an email address for

313
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
them and then just say hello can i sell

314
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
domains from you

315
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
and sometimes they don't respond and

316
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
sometimes they do sometimes they have

317
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,480
weird requirements for what you have to

318
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
do

319
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
and it takes weeks months sometimes to

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,360
just sort this out this is the really

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,399
boring

322
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
business stuff that has to happen before

323
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
any money or anything can change hands

324
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
to actually register a domain name

325
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
this is a slightly redacted

326
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
um

327
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
copy of the contract between me and

328
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
verisign for c for cc and dot tv

329
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
uh these

330
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
i have

331
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
hundreds of pages of these for every

332
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
single top level domain i have to sell

333
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,279
they're really annoying to read they're

334
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,040
they're just

335
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
i hate this

336
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,959
it's the worst to deal with and it

337
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
doesn't and it just keeps getting worse

338
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
because then once you've actually

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,120
negotiated access to the registries most

340
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
of them require you to do some form of

341
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,440
testing to show you are competent in the

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
protocols that they use to manage domain

343
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
names each of these tests generally

344
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
takes between an hour and six hours to

345
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
complete and most of them have to be

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
done manually they can't exactly be

347
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
automated because every single registry

348
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,519
has their own testing system and they

349
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,160
want to test different bits so this this

350
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
isn't standardized you just have to sit

351
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
down and throw commands at them

352
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
and then email them to say we did these

353
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
commands here's the responses we got and

354
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
then they say okay looks like you know

355
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
what you're doing and then they let you

356
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
actually have access to the registry

357
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,399
this is for this is a first page of the

358
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
testing document for switch which is the

359
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
swiss institute that sells dot ch and

360
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
dot ally domain names this is actually

361
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
public on their website if you'd like to

362
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
go read it

363
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,200
i can't exactly say it's a fun read but

364
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
it's suddenly interesting

365
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
and then after this

366
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
consider your actions because

367
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,839
only now did i realize how much of a big

368
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,560
task i'd got into because once i got

369
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,279
access to everything then i was sent all

370
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,199
the manuals for how things work and how

371
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,279
absolutely cursed every element of

372
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,760
managing a domain name is there's one of

373
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,839
these kind of manuals for every single

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440
extension they're

375
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,920
between about 100 and 300 pages long and

376
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,519
you need to read them before you're able

377
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,320
to

378
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
actually properly sell a domain name and

379
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
you need to implement all the processes

380
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,360
in this manual into your system before

381
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
you can actually manage them

382
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,800
there's here so for example here is a

383
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
simplified diagram of a domain name

384
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
lifecycle

385
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,800
um

386
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
and see if i can i can use my mouse as a

387
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,160
pointer um so it's it starts off in

388
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,199
available

389
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,440
because nobody's registered it and then

390
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
you can register a domain name and it

391
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
goes into the ad grace period which is

392
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,160
usually about five days and then if you

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,519
delete a domain name in there you've

394
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,120
refunded the cost of the domain name and

395
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
it's immediately available to register

396
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,760
again i'm not entirely sure why this

397
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
exists as a system i think it's a

398
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
oh i didn't mean to register that let me

399
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,360
undo it although no registrar tends to

400
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
expose this to their customers because

401
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
there's generally a limit of i think 90

402
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
percent of your domains you have to

403
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
register you have to keep you can only

404
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
use the grace period on about 10 of them

405
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
and registrars wouldn't want to offer

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,399
that to

407
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,680
their clients

408
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
because then people would just keep

409
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
buying domain names for random things

410
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
and canceling them before they'd have to

411
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
pay and that would eat into their 10

412
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,199
buffer of accidental registrations or

413
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,639
whatever

414
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,440
and then after five days of the ad grace

415
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
period it goes into the normal

416
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
registered state

417
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
which is the default stated domain name

418
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
is in 98 of the time

419
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,560
you can then uh renew it and it goes

420
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
into the renewal grace period and after

421
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
five days goes back into the registered

422
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
period if you delete it

423
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
on renewal then it's

424
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
you get refunded the cost of renewal or

425
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
if it gets transferred after you've

426
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
explicitly renewed it you also get

427
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,959
refunded the the cost of

428
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
of the renewal because the trans

429
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,279
transfer includes by default one year of

430
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
renewal you can do more sometimes this

431
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
isn't supported but it's um

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,320
when you transfer a domain name from

433
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,160
one registrar to the other you have to

434
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
pay the cost of one year's renewal this

435
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,560
is mostly i believe so the registrar can

436
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,959
pick up a bit of a margin on

437
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,680
that renewal to cover the cost of

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
dealing with the transfer there's

439
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,880
also the whole transfer system is

440
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
complicated because you can transfer

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
from both sides so either you can push

442
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,360
it to

443
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
you from the old registrar to the new

444
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
registrar or the new registrar can pull

445
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
it from the old registrar and sometimes

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,880
icann does a transfer themselves when oh

447
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,839
hang on

448
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
there we go

449
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519
um when you're doing bulk transfers

450
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,759
between registries

451
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,720
so all registrars so say someone's been

452
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
subbed uh a sub-registrar of someone

453
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,639
else and then started their own

454
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
registrar icon might force over all the

455
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,279
old all the domains from the old

456
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,880
registrar to the new registrar without

457
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
any involvement

458
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,119
of the other two parties so that gets

459
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,199
easily complicated and then right at the

460
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
end there's this weird redemption grace

461
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
period thing where if you delete a

462
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,439
domain it's not actually deleted until

463
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
45 days later and you can pay a usually

464
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
quite substantial charge of about 10

465
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,919
times the yearly fee of the domain to

466
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,559
restore it back to the normal registered

467
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,919
state

468
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
this is again

469
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,760
mostly just a way to extract money from

470
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
people uh who accidentally delete

471
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
domains that they didn't intend to and

472
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
then after the redemption grace periods

473
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
it then goes into pending delete where

474
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,360
you can't do anything with it for five

475
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
days and then it's back to available to

476
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
register

477
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,440
this is for normal tlds there are tlds

478
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,799
that are different which is most of them

479
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,120
because of course there are

480
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,559
so

481
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,880
ken there's a few examples here but it's

482
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
mostly it's mostly the country codes

483
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,200
domains which are different because the

484
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
generic top-level domains have explicit

485
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
contracts with icann which

486
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
specify a lot of how this has to work

487
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
whereas country code domains have

488
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
no formal relationship with icon at all

489
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,760
so can do whatever they want

490
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
dot ke i know for example processes

491
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
updates manually so when you send them

492
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
an update command that then just gets

493
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
logged as an email for someone to go

494
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
update the zone file

495
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
this has resulted in mistake in mistakes

496
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,039
in the zone file multiple times for me

497
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
where they've typoed a name server or

498
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
something and then i have to email

499
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
someone to say what have you done

500
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,120
um dot c h and dot l i don't actually

501
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,880
support explicit renewal they'll just

502
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,919
renew automatically unless you delete

503
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
dot uk doesn't let you delete domains

504
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
you just have to let them expire

505
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
dot de is weird in every single way

506
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,559
dot is doesn't really do the whole

507
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
registrar thing but you kind of can do

508
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
it if you

509
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
do some weird things but they also

510
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,679
some of the commands rely on emails

511
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
coming back and forth so in one of my

512
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,559
pieces of code it sends a command to

513
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,919
the is registry who then sends an email

514
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,000
back to me and then i have to have

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,559
something go read the email and pull a

516
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,360
link out and click and like

517
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,679
navigate to that link for the command

518
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,440
that i've sent to them to get actually

519
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
complete

520
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
which

521
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
this is very not well what's the word

522
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,919
this breaks easily

523
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
and you know all the other domains are

524
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
slightly weird.eu

525
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,080
keeps different kinds of contacts for

526
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
different things so in normally you can

527
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
create one contact

528
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
in the domain name system and then use

529
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
that for every single contact field like

530
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
the admin the technical the billing

531
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,080
contact dot eu requires you create

532
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
different kinds of contacts for every

533
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
single thing that you want to put in

534
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
which completely breaks standard and so

535
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
edge cases everywhere

536
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
so enough about the business processes

537
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
how do you actually

538
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,200
talk to a registry most

539
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
if not all

540
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
uh there are there are exceptions use

541
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,919
the extensible provisioning protocol

542
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
which is a

543
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,520
wacky xml based over raw tls

544
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
spack for

545
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,840
managing objects it's not it's designed

546
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,679
for domains but also designed in a way

547
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
that you could use it for any other

548
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
database object which means it does it's

549
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,840
got some weird things in there and it's

550
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,720
a

551
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,919
it's not

552
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,480
it's not simple to implement at all

553
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
there are many rfcs these are just the

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
ones that are registered with ayana

555
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
there are also everyone has their own

556
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
extensions that are usually poorly

557
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
documented or conflict with other

558
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,000
people's extensions so the main epp is

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
uh internet standard number 69 which

560
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,760
combines rfc 5730-5734

561
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,280
um and then there are various extensions

562
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,880
for things like the uh registration

563
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
grace period dns sec mapping launch

564
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
phase mapping

565
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
change poll extensions fee extensions

566
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,679
login security extensions

567
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,720
and

568
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,280
maintenance notifications so you can get

569
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
non like you can get over the epp

570
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
session non

571
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
things which aren't related directly to

572
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
a domain so you can get a notification

573
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,640
from the registry saying hey we'll be

574
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
doing maintenance at this time

575
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,640
i know of one registry that implements

576
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
it which is godaddy registry it would be

577
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,320
really nice if all the other registries

578
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
implemented it so i don't have to

579
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,679
manually pass all their emails to put

580
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
the maintenance into a calendar

581
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,159
epp is a cursed protocol you just open a

582
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,039
tls session then spew two bytes of

583
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,159
length and then xml you just

584
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,559
throw xml over raw tls because

585
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,400
apparently that's the same way of doing

586
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
things but with a tiny little bit of

587
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,960
binary encoding just just to mess with

588
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,039
things even more it's not raw it's not

589
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,320
just taxed there's every few every

590
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
message is preceded with a few bytes

591
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,039
that you have to deal with manually

592
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,320
of course this is not like any other

593
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,039
this is completely unlike any other uh

594
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
wrapping format that exists because of

595
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,240
course we had to go

596
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
invent our own so let's have a look at

597
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
how an epp session might work so when

598
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,120
you first connect you get the greeting

599
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,679
from the server which tells you which

600
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,640
server you've connected to and what time

601
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
the server thinks it is so you can see

602
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
if your clock is in sync with the server

603
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
or if the server's wildly misbehaving or

604
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
something

605
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
then you you get

606
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,799
an

607
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,320
list of object url uris or yes object

608
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
namespace uris these are the objects

609
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
which the server says i you can manage

610
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
these types of objects over this epp

611
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
session so here we have a relatively

612
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
standard one which just says you can

613
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
manage domains contacts and hosts which

614
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
are name servers

615
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,640
and then you also have a list of

616
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
extensions which can be used

617
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
on these objects

618
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,520
and it said this server supports dns sec

619
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
the registration grace period launch

620
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
phase of two different versions

621
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,080
uh internationalized domain names which

622
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
we'll get onto later and the fee

623
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
extension so you can query how much a

624
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,799
domain will cost you to register because

625
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,799
not all domains under a tld have the

626
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,360
same price some of them like if they're

627
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
two characters or something they might

628
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
put up the price because that's a more

629
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,280
desirable domain name so you need a way

630
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
to query how much

631
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
that

632
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
costs

633
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
then to log in you send a login command

634
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
with your client id and a password

635
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
this this is the only authentication

636
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
it's just username passwords to access

637
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
the whole thing as long as you know the

638
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,919
the server you're talking to you don't

639
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,880
need any fancy authentication to talk to

640
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
most registrar

641
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
registries some of them

642
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,080
do

643
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,039
mutual tls but not most of them most of

644
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,919
them will just accept any certificate

645
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,559
whereas a select few will require that

646
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,400
you have this specific certificate

647
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
issued to you this isn't very secure

648
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,559
because the password is also limited to

649
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,679
eight characters by standard so

650
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000
yay

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,320
and then you send here are the objects i

652
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
would like to manage on this session so

653
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
then the server knows what to expect

654
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
from you and whether you've got whether

655
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,159
you've accidentally sent something

656
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
malformed it'll know well i wasn't told

657
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
that we were going to be managing this

658
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,640
object so i'll assume this was an error

659
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,799
and then because this is a login command

660
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,159
this is a command and not just the

661
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,919
greeting it comes with a client

662
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,880
transaction identifier this is how you

663
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
identify

664
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
responses to your commands because it's

665
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,760
just a t it's just a tcp session that

666
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
you're sending xml back and forth over

667
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
and you can send multiple commands in

668
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,919
one go and then wait for all of them to

669
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
get a response you don't have to it's

670
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
you don't have to send a command wait

671
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
for response you can send five and get

672
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
five responses so every command has a

673
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
client transaction identifier so you can

674
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,360
identify in response to which command

675
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,120
did this response come from

676
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,520
and then hopefully if you've got your

677
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,960
login right you get a 100 error no 1 000

678
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
error code and command completed

679
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
successfully and you've logged in and

680
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,120
now you can manage domains and here

681
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
you've got the client transaction

682
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,120
identifier that you sent back and the

683
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,279
server transaction identifier which you

684
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,559
can log

685
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,880
say if you sent a command and it didn't

686
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,799
do what you expected you'd then be able

687
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,960
to contact the registry and say hey this

688
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
server transaction identifier what

689
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,320
happened here something weird happened

690
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,640
you can also get messages from the

691
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,039
registry so there's

692
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,240
if you

693
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
uh so they can notify you about things

694
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
such as oh this domain was renewed or

695
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,320
this domain is requested to be

696
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
transferred out or we updated this

697
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,320
domain from our end please update your

698
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,000
records accordingly

699
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,760
and you do that by sending a poll

700
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,559
command with request and then you either

701
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,640
get a one three zero zero or one three

702
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
zero one or one three zero zero is there

703
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
are no messages for you one three zero

704
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
one is there are messages and the

705
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,600
message is included uh within it so yeah

706
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
one three zero one and then you get a

707
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
message which says there's one message

708
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,919
in the queue uh this is the identifier

709
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,600
this is when it was put in the queue so

710
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
you can see how old the message is

711
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,679
and then in this in this example i've

712
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,880
put a change poll in which is switch

713
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
telling me that they've updated the dns

714
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,480
sec settings on the domain

715
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
uh

716
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
automatically via the dns sac

717
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,799
extension it says we've added these dns

718
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,200
set keys to your domain for you

719
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
um

720
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,520
for some reason epp calls dns sec sec

721
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
dns i have no idea why someone at

722
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,919
verison decided that about 10 years ago

723
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,640
and that's what stuck

724
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
so moving on with dns sac this is

725
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,200
very complicated to get right and it's

726
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
even more complicated when you're

727
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,120
dealing with the cursed protocols that

728
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
manage a domain name it's everyone i'm

729
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,159
sure has accidentally broken something

730
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,480
by either just deploying incorrect dns

731
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
or incorrect dns sac then you have to

732
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
wait for the timers to expire and all

733
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,679
the

734
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
and all the um signatures to expire and

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,919
then things work again and there's not

736
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,200
much you can do

737
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,159
so

738
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,159
for those unaware dnsec is a way of

739
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,880
chaining trust from

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,440
uh between between name servers so you

741
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
have up here

742
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
the uh the root zone key which is

743
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
managed by iana

744
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,480
and that's the trust anchor and then

745
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,039
via various keys and records you can

746
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,919
build trust from the route to.nat to

747
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,279
your website

748
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,720
but you need to set up this dias record

749
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
which says

750
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,520
oh yeah this dns key here for this zone

751
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,039
this is the dns key that should be

752
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,279
trusted to be authoritative from this

753
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,240
stone

754
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,919
and then that's signed by the parent

755
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,799
zone but you if you put any typos or any

756
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
mistakes in these then everything breaks

757
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
because everyone thinks oh this is an

758
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
impersonation this server is

759
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
impersonating the domain and ignores the

760
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,200
records so there's a way to manage this

761
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
which is relatively recent in

762
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
the

763
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
domain registrar space which is a cds so

764
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,520
you have a dias record

765
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
which looks like this which contains the

766
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
key id the algorithm and the hash

767
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,919
and then you can but that goes in the

768
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,240
parent zone like an s record would

769
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,120
whereas a cds goes into child zone hence

770
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
child at the start

771
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,880
and you can just publish this in your

772
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
dns zone and then your registrar can

773
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
pick up on this record published in your

774
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,039
dns zone and automatically configure dns

775
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,480
sec for you

776
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,279
the hope is that

777
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
bind and not and the various

778
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,600
authoritative domain servers will

779
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,679
automatically start inserting cds

780
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,360
records so then all you have to do is

781
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,320
tell your dns server enable dns sac and

782
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
then the dns server can sort out

783
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,440
configuring everything for you

784
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,159
automatically

785
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,320
there are a few problems with

786
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,039
cds notably the first being how do you

787
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,960
know that the request is legitimate

788
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
because the zone isn't signed yet so

789
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
it's not clear

790
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,360
it's not obvious

791
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,240
that the request to add this signature

792
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
to the zone is legitimate it could be

793
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,320
someone trying to impersonate that name

794
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,799
server and saying oh yeah add this

795
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,720
signature to the zone and then someone

796
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,799
else has control of the dns set keys for

797
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
your zone and there's nothing you can do

798
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
about it

799
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,880
uh the rfc on this offers a few

800
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,200
solutions there's accept policy via

801
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
authenticated channel which is you

802
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,960
publish a cds record and then you can

803
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
tell the registry i've just published

804
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
one go fetch it now instead of them

805
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,279
constantly trying to find one and just

806
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,399
in putting in any one they find there's

807
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,480
except with extra checks

808
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
uh which can be say checking that all

809
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
the name servers respond or checking the

810
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,760
names of or responding

811
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
uh checking the name server globally to

812
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
see if it's a local hijack that could

813
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,720
impact this except after delay so you

814
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
might notice the cds policy you send an

815
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,559
email to the

816
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,320
registered domain holder and say oh

817
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
we're about to update your dns second

818
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,559
five days with this new policy which is

819
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,880
what that earlier message from switch

820
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
saying we we've that was the we've

821
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,360
updated your dns policy but you do get

822
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,039
one earlier saying we're about to update

823
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,520
your policy um

824
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,039
then there's also like accept with

825
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,799
challenge where they will send you an

826
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,120
email saying we found this dnsac policy

827
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
would you like to add it and won't do

828
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
anything until you explicitly click yes

829
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
and then there's also except from

830
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,080
inception

831
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,960
which is you set up the dns zone on your

832
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
server before you buy the domain and

833
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,960
then they look immediately when you buy

834
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,080
the domain

835
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,720
for a cds policy and apply that so then

836
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
the domain is never insecure

837
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,360
there's also this wonderfully named ietf

838
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
draft they can never come up with short

839
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,720
names for this

840
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
for dns sec bootstrapping where

841
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
you can put a copy of the cds record in

842
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,640
a special signaling zone on the name

843
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,559
servers so if you wanted to set up say

844
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,000
dns sec for glaucoda space um but

845
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
there's and the name servers are ns1 and

846
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
ns2.as2o7960.net

847
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,519
you can add the cds records into

848
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,679
glauco.space and add a copy of them into

849
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,039
underscore

850
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,320
dsboot.thedomain.signal.the nameserver

851
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,240
and then because this is a signed uh you

852
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
have the signatures the rrsegs here

853
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
which signs these you know that this is

854
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,760
trusted because the domains the name

855
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,120
servers that are registered with the

856
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,760
domain have their own dns sect chain of

857
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,960
trust and have signed the cds records to

858
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
say yes i do actually want the cds

859
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,360
records to be put into dns sac so then

860
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
hopefully once this all these things

861
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
have been standardized you'll be able to

862
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,039
just

863
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,080
dnsec should just automatically enable

864
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,279
itself on all your domains hopefully

865
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,399
um

866
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,279
now moving on to utf-8 domains because

867
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,600
the the internet was designed

868
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
by a load of americans who did not have

869
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,159
much consideration for

870
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,039
internationalization so we have to do

871
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,480
some

872
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
weird things to get

873
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,480
a utf-8 character into a domain name

874
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
because the standards

875
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,840
quite explicitly say

876
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
for dns that you can't have anything

877
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
above ascii 127 in the domain and

878
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,279
despite technically allowing that it's

879
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,760
it causes problems so we decided against

880
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
putting unicode straight in the domain

881
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,720
name system

882
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,080
so there's

883
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,279
a system which goes via various names it

884
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,039
has too many names but you probably know

885
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,840
is either pony code or idna or

886
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,279
internationalized domain names in

887
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,519
applications this is an older standard

888
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,519
than you think it was first properly

889
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,120
supported around 2003 in these now

890
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,279
ancient pieces of software who would

891
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
have thought internet explorer 7 would

892
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,120
be a forward thinking piece of software

893
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,840
and supporting unicode but there you go

894
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,279
so

895
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,000
this is how a record is encoded a domain

896
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,559
name packet and it's length delimited so

897
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,279
you have like eight characters and then

898
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,720
the character string and then three

899
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,320
characters and then the character string

900
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,720
for the next label the dots you type in

901
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,159
when you type in the domain name never

902
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
make it into the dns packet

903
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,320
because it's length delimited so in

904
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,559
theory you could put unicode in here but

905
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,880
too many systems take this and turn it

906
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
back into ascii and then just blindly

907
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,600
assume it's ascii and that would break

908
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,880
things because

909
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,239
of course it would

910
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,480
um because nobody actually obeys the

911
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,560
standard correctly if this is just some

912
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,879
byte strings everyone just assumes it's

913
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,960
taxed because that's all anyone has ever

914
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,480
seen it has so let's go let's look at

915
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,320
how you encode a domain name as uh utf-8

916
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
so let's let's say i have this this

917
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,239
domain name first we split it into the

918
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
labels because that's how they're

919
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,800
transmitted on the wire so the actual

920
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
dots aren't in there we split it into

921
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,839
the labels that will be transmitted in

922
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,719
the dns packet then if something's ascii

923
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,040
only we just leave it alone don't do any

924
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,239
processing

925
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,560
uh then as if something does have

926
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,320
unicode in we have to actually do

927
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,199
something to it first step is to

928
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,918
normalize it using the

929
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,159
very long preparation enforcement and

930
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,918
comparison of internationalized strings

931
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,079
and applications protocol

932
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,760
this just makes sure that whatever

933
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,000
someone has typed in it always results

934
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,079
in the same domain name

935
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
lookup so you wouldn't have being able

936
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
to type in one string one way and it

937
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
would come out to a different website

938
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
than typing it in the other way in this

939
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,160
case all it does is lowercase is the b

940
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
but in some of the cases

941
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,079
it actually makes

942
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,079
more use it actually does things

943
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,079
differently so there are two ways you

944
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
could say type this character you could

945
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,520
just type in

946
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
u plus e seven latin small letter c with

947
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,839
cidelia or you could put in a c and the

948
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,760
combining character

949
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,440
both of these are valid and will render

950
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,119
identically and it's impossible to tell

951
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,560
them apart unless you actually look at

952
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,960
the unicode byte string so

953
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
the how depending on how someone's typed

954
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,200
it in on that keyboard it could be one

955
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
of these two ways then you need to

956
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,879
normalize it to be able to

957
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,760
get a consistent domain name at the end

958
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,520
once you've normalized it then you can

959
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
actually start encoding it which uses

960
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,280
something called

961
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,160
uh

962
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
uh ascii compatible encoding so first

963
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,599
you add the prefix accent

964
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,280
which can never appear at the start of

965
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,599
the domain name normally so that tells

966
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,359
the system this is a unicode domain

967
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,240
um treat it differently then you put

968
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,800
everything that's already ascii in place

969
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,119
and store everything that isn't ascii

970
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,640
elsewhere

971
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
this is done for efficiency reasons

972
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
because it is longer to encode every

973
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
character differently

974
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
than it is just to put the character in

975
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,880
place it was already valid and then you

976
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
put the another dash at the end which is

977
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,040
the basic code point segregator the

978
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,440
basic code points are ascii everything

979
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
else is unicode and is encoded

980
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,960
differently

981
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
so then

982
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,240
we have to put code .252 in position one

983
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,960
which gives us a delta of

984
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,119
745.

985
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,079
i have some slides to explain how this

986
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,400
works but you just calculate

987
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
the length of the string times the code

988
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
point minus x80 because that's where

989
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
ascii stops so you don't have to encode

990
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,079
so it starts encoding at one one two

991
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,920
eight instead of having to skip through

992
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
one to all the first 127 characters

993
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
because you know they won't be in the

994
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
bit afterwards

995
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,560
and then position one so add one at the

996
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
end so the way

997
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,119
this works is best to look at from the

998
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,359
viewpoint of the decoder the decoder

999
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,160
will step through every possible spot

1000
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,000
in the domain

1001
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
and see could i insert a unicode

1002
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,880
character here so it starts on iteration

1003
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,000
zero and the test code point is 128

1004
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,880
because it's zero plus x80 which is

1005
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,680
where

1006
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
non-ascii starts and

1007
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
it sees do i insert it in position zero

1008
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,040
or do i entered in position one two

1009
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,240
etcetera and then the delta is how many

1010
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
iterations of this

1011
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
has the decoder gone through so then it

1012
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
has to go through it will just keep

1013
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
going through many different code points

1014
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,200
until you get up to eventually iterate

1015
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
delta seven four four and then

1016
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
delta seven four five and the see the

1017
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
delta we calculated earlier is that

1018
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,960
delta so it says ah we put this

1019
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
character in there

1020
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,320
and then

1021
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,560
so that's that's what the delta means

1022
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,119
and then you use something called base60

1023
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,280
base 36 generalized variable length

1024
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
integers to encode all the deltas you

1025
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,560
calculated for the different characters

1026
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,880
at the end um so in this case

1027
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,680
745 gets encoded as kva

1028
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,560
there's

1029
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,800
i couldn't come up with a decent way to

1030
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
explain how generalized variable length

1031
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,240
integers work uh there are docs on the

1032
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,119
internet i struggle to understand them

1033
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,280
but effectively you can smoosh you can

1034
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
put together just characters and it's

1035
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,839
possible to tell

1036
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,680
where the where a

1037
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,240
set of numbers stops so you don't have

1038
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,119
it's because you could like if you have

1039
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,200
11 and 11 you put them together that

1040
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,040
could be the 211s or

1041
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,200
1111 and it's not possible with normal

1042
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,359
integers to tell apart where one integer

1043
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,960
ends in the next start

1044
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,040
with variable length integers it is

1045
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
possible

1046
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,000
so there it's not quite base 36 but it's

1047
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,880
mostly just base 36 encoding

1048
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
of the

1049
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
of the of the list of deltas at the end

1050
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,119
of the domain name and then you can join

1051
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,000
it all up and you end up with this at

1052
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,839
the bottom which is what actually gets

1053
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,200
registered

1054
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,680
as the uh domain name

1055
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,880
right

1056
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
um

1057
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,040
so now some more on the whole move from

1058
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,720
whois to ardap what's wrong with who is

1059
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,119
it was designed by english people so has

1060
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,040
no provision for anything other than

1061
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,200
english it doesn't specify a character

1062
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,680
set it doesn't specify anything to

1063
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,240
signal the cat what encoding anything is

1064
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,800
in everyone just assumes it's ascii

1065
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
although sometimes it isn't

1066
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,640
uh and this isn't there's no

1067
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,480
standardization on how to do this so

1068
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
it's a pain to deal with

1069
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
the whois protocol also has absolutely

1070
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,599
no provisions for security which is

1071
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,200
great when you're dealing with people's

1072
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,599
personal data

1073
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,920
the rdap protocol does add in security

1074
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,079
and ways to authenticate requests but

1075
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,680
it's still a work in progress on how

1076
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,040
this works who is just blindly and well

1077
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,079
until gdpr really just blindly threw out

1078
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,599
everyone's personal information for

1079
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,920
every single domain name in the world

1080
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,839
um it's also

1081
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,760
really difficult to pass because these

1082
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,240
are two different example huiz responses

1083
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,119
one from dinic and one from

1084
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:49,920
uh

1085
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,119
verisign

1086
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,280
they that then there's no format

1087
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,079
standardization between the two of how

1088
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,240
to do this and this is just tax it's

1089
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
easy enough to read but good luck

1090
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,480
getting a computer to pass that so

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,400
recently we've been moving towards rdap

1092
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,440
for this which is based on rest and json

1093
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,240
which

1094
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,480
yeah jason's all right i mean it's it's

1095
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
passable and has some semblance of

1096
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,119
security so then you can just make a

1097
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,200
http request to the rdap server and use

1098
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,359
all the authentications the stuff that

1099
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,240
you can normally use with ardap and just

1100
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,560
get back an easily possible json which

1101
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,480
contains all the data you want

1102
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,079
structured

1103
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,240
which is much nicer for everyone and

1104
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,920
means we don't have to deal with weird

1105
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,520
data errors when something isn't in the

1106
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,480
format we expect so rdap isn't perfect

1107
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,240
though as mentioned the security

1108
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
elements are still a work in progress

1109
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,240
it's a bit difficult to figure out how

1110
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,319
this whole business structure of icann

1111
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,319
and the registries and the registrars

1112
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,319
works out so they can authenticate to

1113
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,720
each other over our dap and

1114
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
also law enforcement of course they like

1115
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
to get involved and they want access to

1116
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,640
this information so icann is trying to

1117
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
figure out a way to allow them to

1118
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,119
authenticate and get the rdap implement

1119
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,839
the more private rdap information rdap

1120
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,680
also just uses uh vcards which

1121
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,440
is another standard which isn't very

1122
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,359
possible but it's v cards represented as

1123
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,960
json

1124
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
there's a move to move to something

1125
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,359
called j cards which is much more

1126
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,280
structured towards how jason should work

1127
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,839
v cards are just a nightmare to pass

1128
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,599
and finally

1129
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,760
how can you do this yourself if the off

1130
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,319
all after all of this you can you would

1131
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,880
like to run your own domain registrar or

1132
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,560
just have greater control over own

1133
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
domains and maybe do this for a few

1134
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
friends how can you do it yourself first

1135
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
of all don't but here's how you can

1136
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
so generic top-level domains require

1137
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,640
icon accreditation so this is anything

1138
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
that isn't a country code domain

1139
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,359
uh icon accreditation is generally quite

1140
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,160
expensive uh on the order of

1141
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
maybe 5 000 us dollars a year to

1142
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
maintain accreditation and you need to

1143
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,280
provide pages and pages of documentation

1144
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
of how your business operates and how

1145
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,720
you keep your data secure and it's all

1146
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
very sensible stuff

1147
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,079
because they don't want someone selling

1148
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,839
domains and then going out of business

1149
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,079
and suddenly oh no wearable the domain's

1150
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,560
gone but it's not really

1151
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,960
manageable as an individual to do this

1152
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,240
cctlds generally accept anyone some of

1153
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,640
them are a bit weird but here are a few

1154
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,880
that will accept anyone no matter the

1155
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
volume they're selling verisign for cc

1156
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,040
and dot tv

1157
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,240
dot uk phenomena and nominee is really

1158
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
friendly to individuals having their own

1159
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,599
accounts so that's a great place to

1160
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,200
start dot c h dot l i which is switch

1161
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,880
the finish one

1162
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,119
the montenegrin one which is ran by

1163
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,800
affilius not the montenegrin government

1164
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,480
for some reason and is for iceland these

1165
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
are great registries if you'd like to

1166
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,200
there's a great place to start

1167
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,599
and they're generally quite okay with

1168
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,200
small businesses or individuals doing

1169
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,079
this

1170
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,760
if you'd like more information about who

1171
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,599
to contact at these places to do things

1172
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,760
come talk to me afterwards

1173
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
there's also the software that i use to

1174
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,160
talk epp you probably don't want to have

1175
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
to deal with epp yourself

1176
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,520
so i open source my software it talks it

1177
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
exposes all the epp stuff as nice grpc

1178
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,319
so you don't have to deal with all the

1179
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,560
xml stuff you can just send relatively

1180
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,400
sane commands to the server

1181
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
and it deals with all the negotiating

1182
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,720
back and forth between the registry and

1183
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
you to get this working uh it's on

1184
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,680
github there are docs if you'd like more

1185
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,440
help with getting this started i can

1186
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,560
also help

1187
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,680
um so i think that's everything come

1188
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,920
talk to me afterwards if you have any

1189
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
questions or would like to do this

1190
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,160
yourself or just anything in general i'm

1191
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,839
happy to talk about it i hope you've

1192
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,839
enjoyed

1193
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
[Applause]

1194
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
wow

1195
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,920
that was insane that is a great start to

1196
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,839
a great morning isn't it

1197
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,720
um

1198
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,440
let me check to the signal angel we got

1199
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,760
no questions from around the world

1200
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,720
um

1201
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,880
we do have time for a few questions i

1202
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,400
can take questions now you can take

1203
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,640
questions so

1204
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,079
questions on the mic in the middle

1205
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,400
please

1206
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,520
if the mic in middle is on could you

1207
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,599
just keep on talking we'll check yeah

1208
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,280
well yeah thanks

1209
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,480
nice

1210
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,720
actually i have two questions okay um

1211
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,520
i live in holland so i'm only interested

1212
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
for my own projects in

1213
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,720
the dot nl yes um

1214
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
how feasible would it be for

1215
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,160
hobby projects to become an

1216
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,319
own

1217
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:54,400
register yes for

1218
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,800
just only one

1219
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,960
tlb that's that's easily done there are

1220
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,599
a few companies that only do one tld i

1221
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,440
believe dot nl has the problem of

1222
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,680
there's a minimum charge of 40 euros a

1223
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,920
month so unless you have 40 euros a

1224
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,960
month of domain names renewing then it's

1225
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
more expensive to get an account

1226
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,640
directly with them it may be that you

1227
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,160
just want to do this anyway and you can

1228
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,480
find that money but they they're

1229
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,119
generally okay about it they just like

1230
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,520
much prefer people with higher volumes

1231
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
so we'll put a minimum charge on your

1232
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,839
accounts if you don't meet that volume

1233
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,040
all right

1234
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,280
and i'm not allowing a follow-up

1235
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,119
question i'm sorry because we have five

1236
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,720
people standing here and we have four

1237
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,880
minutes all right come talk to me later

1238
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,599
come come afterwards yeah please

1239
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,520
thank you for the nice presentation

1240
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,359
i used to work for a

1241
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,760
domain registrar i was in charge of the

1242
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,920
dns sec

1243
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,240
rollout and one of the things i had to

1244
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,520
look at was

1245
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,720
moving the nsx signed domains to another

1246
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,119
registrar yes and it was mostly a

1247
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,839
theoretical exercise back then in 2018

1248
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,920
yes uh and what we had to do was we had

1249
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,160
to like figure out how to exchange

1250
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,480
public keys with the other registrar and

1251
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,640
then they had to um

1252
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,720
include it in

1253
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,480
something they have to include a new

1254
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,240
public key in the zone and have it

1255
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,119
signed and then move it that way um is

1256
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,839
it still done like this way is it being

1257
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,160
used in practice well so the the

1258
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
difficulty comes there's the difference

1259
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,720
between dns and the domain name system

1260
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,280
so if you're not changing dns provider

1261
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,720
when you transfer a domain there's

1262
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,040
nothing to do because the dns sac

1263
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
records will stay with the domain when

1264
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,800
you transfer it the problem is most

1265
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
people also use dns provided by their

1266
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,160
domain registrar so what generally needs

1267
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,440
to happen is this is where cds comes in

1268
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,559
because you could switch over dns first

1269
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,000
and signal with cds that you'd like

1270
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,040
these new ds records to be inserted into

1271
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,000
the parent zone and then later transfer

1272
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,319
over the domain name to um

1273
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,160
so because there's already a weight of

1274
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,079
about five days for a domain to transfer

1275
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,520
because they can the transfer can be

1276
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,640
revoked

1277
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,480
uh so you could at the start of the

1278
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,440
transfer move over the the name servers

1279
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,800
and use cds to set up dns sac and then

1280
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,400
hopefully by the end of the five-day

1281
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,079
transfer period all the dnstec will have

1282
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,040
sorted it out and it should work this is

1283
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,960
again still very theoretical i'm not

1284
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,559
aware of anyone who's managed to pull it

1285
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,480
off perfectly yet

1286
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
moving between name servers with dnsec

1287
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,680
is always a problem and this is why

1288
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,359
we're working on it but

1289
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,960
it's still not quite perfect

1290
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,559
multi-theoretical okay thank you

1291
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,559
yes first of all thanks a lot for the

1292
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,200
presentation uh we previously discussed

1293
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,119
um on a few other tlds yes had a

1294
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,359
horrible method of managing name service

1295
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,760
and personal information by means of

1296
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,680
some words some shoddy wordpress site or

1297
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,079
something yes uh are there other tlds

1298
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,839
that still do this or is epp the

1299
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,680
absolute bare minimum that you would be

1300
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,359
able to expect from uh

1301
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,839
you can pretty much expect epp from

1302
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,000
anything that really matters it's the

1303
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,240
small tlds that do their own thing

1304
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,319
although most of them are moving to epp

1305
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,240
now because it's been the standard for

1306
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,079
over a decade so people are finally

1307
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,000
starting to properly adopt it everywhere

1308
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,800
but 98 percent of the time epp is what

1309
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,319
you'll be dealing with thanks

1310
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,960
hi q and so for the talk you mentioned

1311
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,640
earlier that epp only allows for eight

1312
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,680
character passwords yes um

1313
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,119
like

1314
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,440
what does it mean specifically i'm

1315
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,920
assuming that you cannot put you do not

1316
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,720
get from the registry eight arbitrary

1317
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,800
bytes yeah yeah enough

1318
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,720
it has to be it well it has to be

1319
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,839
encodable in xml which generally means

1320
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:54,960
like no

1321
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,440
weird spec you can't even sometimes

1322
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,200
registries don't let you put like the

1323
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
backtick in the password because that's

1324
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,440
an xml character even though you could

1325
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,880
technically encode it sometimes it

1326
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,040
doesn't work so the security here is

1327
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,400
less than ideal
