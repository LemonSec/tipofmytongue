00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,119
hi i'm wesner and i'm speaking here at

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,640
emerging

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,680
earth tent um

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
i'm hugely grateful to claudia and to

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,920
igor and

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
to mch for providing this platform

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,680
we're talking about the impact of

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,239
internet and technology and hackers to

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
the environmental sustainability

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
and and our earth

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,239
the

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
overarching topic for my talk today is

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
communities so how can we

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
join up in our efforts to

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
contribute to the solution of our

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
problem without being too um doom saying

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
and pessimistic and the most concrete

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
thing that i want to talk about is a

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
conference that i attended called

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
computing within limits

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
oh yeah also uh i'm going to be lisping

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,520
because i got bitten by wasp yesterday

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,479
in my tongue so it's uh

25
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
it's it's uh i'm lucky that i can speak

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
at all

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,159
uh so

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
uh the uh the conference itself was an

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,439
academic interdisciplinary uh

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
event that actually has been happening

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,159
since 2015

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
and this was the eighth uh edition

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
also because they were disrupted by uh

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
by the pandemic

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,200
and i haven't

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
been there in person ever but i've been

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
following them closely since

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,000
2018

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
so this year it was a virtual event

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,000
and the connection between that

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
conference and the hackers community is

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,479
that they have been talking about the

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
topics that we have been also covering

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,159
here at mch

45
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
but also there is a third community that

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
i want to talk about which is the ripe

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
community because i work for the ripe

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
ncc as a community builder and the ripe

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
community also has a big overlap with

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
both the hackers community and the

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
academic researchers

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
so um i'm going to come to this like

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
from kind of three

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,680
um angles

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
and uh since we don't have here slides

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,959
or anything so all the links you can

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
find at ripe labs which is labs the

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
tribe.net

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
have published the article there going

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
through some of the papers that have

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,160
been presented at the conference but we

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
also have a section about sustainability

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
and the other articles are for example

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,959
about how is the

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
uh the flooding

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
uh that uh consequence of the both

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
climate change and uh sea level rise

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,879
going to impact the data centers so how

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,440
can the data center industry prepare for

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
the future

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
of the um

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
two centigrade uh

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,840
higher average global temperatures

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,519
so

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
uh computing within limits yeah it's

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
it's a nice conference let me just uh

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
read

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,280
about the conference from their own

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,159
words

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
so as an interdisciplinary group of

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
researchers practitioners and scholars

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
seeking to reshape the computing

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
research agenda grounded by an awareness

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
that contemporary computing research is

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
intertwined with ecological limits in

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,239
general and climate and climate justice

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
related limits in particular

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
2022 submissions moved us closer towards

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
computing system that support diverse

90
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
human and non-human life forms within

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,000
thriving biospheres so that that sounded

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
wonderful like before it started and

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
then there were

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
great great great um

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,159
papers presented and also the format was

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,519
super weird

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
they have published all the papers in

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
advance

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
so

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
then the presentations were limited to

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,640
10 minutes which is very short for

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
academics and

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
and so

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
so they uh so there were like three

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,440
three papers presented at every session

106
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
so that would be like a half an hour and

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
then there was one hour discussion

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
session in breakout groups called

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
reverse panel so the authors would

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
publish some questions like what did

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,199
they want audience to comment on and

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,919
then the participants would have

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
discussions between themselves and write

114
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
their feedback in the collaboratively

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
edited documents unfortunately google

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
docs but still so everything was uh

117
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
published

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,960
public and transparent and open and

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,919
the participation was also for free so

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,000
it was really nice

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,280
a group exercise in in uh like

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
really interdisciplinary you had people

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
from social sciences

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,160
uh the computer science the the

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
artificial intelligence the activists

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
the artists so it was really really nice

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
so some of the papers um

128
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
that i found interesting for example

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
strategies for d growth computing

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
so that's a combining this concept

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
economic concept alternative economic

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,800
concept of d growth with the

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
research into

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
the the new development of hardware and

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
software and how can we actually do that

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
by

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
sticking to the

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
physical limit as by extending the the

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
life of computers

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
increasing the intensity of use

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
and um

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
what what else did they say um hardware

143
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,280
repurposing software design for the

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
lowered power requirements and so on so

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
uh that actually ties up with the your

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
talk and the discussion that we had

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
yesterday and it also like all so many

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
talks there have mentioned something

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,360
called jayvon's paradox which is about

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
the uh how the increase in efficiency

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
actually only leads to the increase of

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,360
demand so it doesn't like the increase

153
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
in efficiency which is supposed to then

154
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
keep the

155
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,199
um expenditure lower

156
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,000
doesn't happen because the more

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,319
things you provide like

158
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
they often give

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
example of highways because it's just

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,360
more

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
uh tangible for people to kind of

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
understand what's happening like the

163
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
more highways you build

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
it's not going to lead to less congest

165
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
congestion

166
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
whatever congestion or the traffic is

167
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,560
just going to

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
produce more traffic because people will

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
just start using cars more and they'll

170
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
be like more cars produced and people

171
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
will want to move

172
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
further

173
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
away and more frequent and so on so

174
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,880
the same is with the with the

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,360
internet efficiency

176
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
so here we are unpredictable weather

177
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
patterns

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,479
everybody's helping to

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
rescue the papers

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
and clothes from the rain

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
i'm your reporter now if you're watching

182
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,039
this on stream or even on the recording

183
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,400
thank you for saving

184
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,719
all the papers

185
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
okay

186
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
we go on

187
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,840
so um the next work was about

188
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
calculating the carbon footprint of

189
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
streaming media

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,719
now this is a super controversial topic

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
because

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
the researchers

193
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,200
don't agree on how can you calculate the

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
energy expenditure of the streaming

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,080
media and so

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
the authors proposed the holistic

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
end-to-end model that balances the

198
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
high-level and highly

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
detailed approach

200
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,080
and so

201
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,880
oh everything is getting wet

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
so they have published that

203
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
watching one hour of netflix

204
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
consumes

205
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
about one kilowatt of energy which is

206
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
equivalent to a passenger vehicle

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
driving about two kilometers

208
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
so now you know

209
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
when you're binging on netflix

210
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
what does it mean

211
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
um

212
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,959
i'm sure this conclusion will be

213
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
disputed in the next versions of the of

214
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
the computing within limits conference

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
but their slides were amazing because uh

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,399
so their paper paper is really worth

217
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
downloading and looking into especially

218
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
if you're interested in this because

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,720
they have compared uh the previous

220
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
research uh

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
like over the many years many people are

222
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
trying to calculate this and they all

223
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
disagree with each other and so

224
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
um actually there is an upcoming

225
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
conference called acm sig com in

226
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
amsterdam at the end of august

227
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,839
and we have organized

228
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
a workshop there called building greener

229
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
internet so one of the papers

230
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,839
submitted to that

231
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
is called 13 propositions for

232
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
something like that like saving the

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,680
world with green tech or whatever but

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
that is already pre-published so it's

235
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
amazing by posing all kinds of questions

236
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
related to this topic so

237
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
um yeah i'm sure it's going to dispute

238
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
this paper

239
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
so the next one also very dear to my

240
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,360
heart

241
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,880
conceptualizing resource aware higher

242
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
education digital infrastructure

243
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
which is basically criticizing the fact

244
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,680
that all the universities have

245
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
outsourced their

246
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
infrastructure like operating their mail

247
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
servers and the document sharing and

248
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,040
everything

249
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
to

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
unnamed huge providers of the cloud

251
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
services

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
which i don't want to

253
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
promote here like let's say big five

254
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
and the authors

255
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
are suggesting alternative strategies

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,200
for self-hosting

257
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,399
um

258
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
which is kind of returned to how

259
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
self-hosting and and yeah

260
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,760
super weird that we went away from that

261
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
so

262
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
i will read it because it's really

263
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
beautiful

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,399
uh a first quantification of a potential

265
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
return to self-hosting emphasizing its

266
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
effect in energy reduction

267
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
and avoiding e-waste

268
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,560
uh then uh policy actions are needed

269
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
that could enable higher education

270
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
institutions to retake control over

271
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
their digital infrastructure by building

272
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
local services

273
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
so this kind of ties to so many

274
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
different aspects

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
of like

276
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,600
uh avoiding centralization and so on so

277
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
this this mode of operation reduces

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
waste and has the added benefit of

279
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,639
increased resiliency to scenarios of

280
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
resource scarcity and collapse of

281
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
external infrastructure

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
the architecture of a low impact data

283
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
centers

284
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
made up cycled hardware

285
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,800
and resource aware software there is a

286
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,639
significant space to reduce digital

287
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
infrastructure overall resource

288
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
footprint so they are proving that it's

289
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,639
actually

290
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
it's like the opposite of this claim

291
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,880
that if you put everything in a huge

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,959
data center that is more energy

293
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,040
efficient they're saying it's not it's

294
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
actually better to maintain these

295
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,160
services locally uh not only for the

296
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
energy efficiency but also for the

297
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
resilience for the climate catastrophes

298
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
like flooding and fires and we could see

299
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,519
that like there were outages recently of

300
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,680
the huge data centers because of the

301
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
heat wave

302
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
and

303
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
also because of just nothing related to

304
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
climate but like human mistakes like the

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
the canadian

306
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,279
monopoly telco went down for several

307
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
hours and he took down all the services

308
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
around canada because they all had their

309
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,800
eggs in the same basket so emergency

310
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,480
services were down

311
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
um

312
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
of course mobile phones and they

313
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
couldn't even publish like

314
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
um warning to their users

315
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
that they are down because they were

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
down and there was no alternative

317
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,800
so

318
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
uh yeah this this like what i just said

319
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
happened after the conference so it just

320
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
really proves the point that um

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
uh the resilience is in decentralization

322
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
then there was an interesting

323
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
uh more like a social scientist uh

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
artistic paper called uh the richness of

325
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
designing for ecosocial change so they

326
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
they were suggesting to reframe

327
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
limits

328
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,959
to

329
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,680
abundance of the resources that are

330
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
naturally not

331
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,519
limited like human connections human uh

332
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,040
creativity

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,880
and care and so uh this is really um

334
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,800
like intersectional feminist approach to

335
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
the concepts of limits in computing so

336
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,360
they they

337
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
called it like this

338
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,240
a fusion of care infused ecological and

339
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
social sensibilities

340
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
to create existential change that would

341
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,079
impact lifestyle and political choices

342
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
and technology use turning to

343
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,639
potentially abundant human resources of

344
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,920
imagination reflection and solidarity

345
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,800
their example was of a hologram

346
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
a feminist economist healthcare art

347
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,839
project situated online

348
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
illustrating this potential so

349
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
they have been suggesting this

350
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
project at so many places where events

351
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,600
there was a conference in amsterdam

352
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
called money labs they were suggesting

353
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,839
this as alternative uh economic project

354
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
uh they're actually presented to the

355
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,839
hope conference when it was online in

356
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,279
2020 and um

357
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,000
and now here at the computing within

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
limits

359
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
so

360
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,000
i want to connect this to the

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
like the mental health crisis that also

362
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
came like to to focus

363
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
uh during the the pandemic

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
and their approach is uh super simple so

365
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
they illustrated with like a

366
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,160
uh tetra whatever it pyramid something

367
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,959
in greek where you have like four points

368
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,079
one is you and three is other three of

369
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,440
your friends

370
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
and

371
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,079
uh you form a certain hologram kind of a

372
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,519
hologram and you me um each one of your

373
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
friends has like responsibility for one

374
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
aspect of your well-being

375
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,079
and they don't have to be experts

376
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,560
they're just your regular normal people

377
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,440
friends

378
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
and so one of them is uh focused on your

379
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
physical

380
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,480
well-being the other one on your mental

381
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
well-being and a third one on your

382
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
social economical well-being and you

383
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
meet periodically and you have a

384
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
discussion about you so they go like how

385
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
are you doing and then they and then

386
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
they say oh yeah

387
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
uh last last month or over last six

388
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
months i see that this is happening and

389
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
then

390
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
you covered those three aspects and then

391
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
you have a discussion like what would be

392
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,519
good for you and that's it so it can be

393
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,320
done in person it can be done online it

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,040
can be once a week or once a month or

395
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,399
once a year

396
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,639
depending on what your needs are

397
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
and that way you don't depend on the

398
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
health providers which are also depleted

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
and on the uh

400
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
classical economy like you really just

401
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
do this together

402
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,880
as a community and then you expand so

403
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,519
it's not like once then you do that for

404
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,079
other constellations of four people

405
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
groups so that's what they call hologram

406
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,439
okay next one

407
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,119
um oh yeah i have a question have you

408
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,119
um

409
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
read or seen any of those computing

410
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
within limits uh

411
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
conferences papers before

412
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
just claudia so it's super cool go check

413
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,919
it out the link is on this uh behind

414
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,600
this link

415
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
it's called computing within limits

416
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
together like computing within limits

417
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,000
no if you just go to labs thetrap.net

418
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,160
it's like one of the first articles if

419
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
you scroll down it's called

420
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,000
computing within limits 2022 event wrap

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
um

422
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,679
yeah so all of their papers are

423
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,080
available online i won't talk about

424
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,679
more of them

425
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,039
anymore

426
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
i just wanted to mention these other

427
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
opportunities for like combining this

428
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
with other communities so as i said um

429
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
i'm

430
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
from the ripe community and working for

431
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,240
the ripe ncc and we have uh many events

432
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,320
where you could take part and also

433
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
working groups where this is relevant uh

434
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
the derived community functions as like

435
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,799
a voluntary

436
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,080
participation of mostly network

437
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
operators but also other people who are

438
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
interested in the

439
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
global internet governance

440
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
on mostly very technical level but we

441
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,760
have been seeing over the time that

442
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
the internet is not

443
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
for techies and buy tech is only anymore

444
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,000
so we are including more and more people

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
in um in our own community and we of

446
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
course overlapping with many different

447
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,919
communities so if you have interest in

448
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,960
this you can take part in

449
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
different ways

450
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
like um

451
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
in for example internet of things

452
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
working group or something that we call

453
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
cooperation working group where we cover

454
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
more soft topics and

455
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
like legal political social topics

456
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
because normally we would only talk

457
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,400
about bgp routing dns ipv6

458
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
security even security is like

459
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,919
top layers like with and and content is

460
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
completely out of the question

461
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
but actually it's not so it's kind of

462
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
creeping in

463
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
with with the censorship with the

464
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,640
shutdowns and so on so these topics of

465
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,440
sustainability have also been

466
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
um

467
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
covered but it's really not enough focus

468
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
on them so i want to invite you to take

469
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
part and you can do that online we have

470
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
mailing lists

471
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
um

472
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
we are also all over different social

473
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
media but we don't have like a specific

474
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,280
channel where i can invite you to there

475
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
is telegram there's twitter there is

476
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
facebook

477
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,600
and

478
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
discord and stuff like that

479
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,200
and then we have a meeting in october

480
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
uh in belgrade like it's a large

481
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,039
conference there is a call for

482
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
presentations open

483
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
normally you would have to pay

484
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
the conference fee to participate even

485
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
if you're a speaker just like here but

486
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,039
we also have a lot of programs that help

487
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
people

488
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,520
who cannot afford to to pay

489
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,600
several hundred euros for like three

490
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
four hundred euros for a week of a

491
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
conference so we have academic

492
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
um

493
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,400
cooperation program

494
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
where the academics gets sponsored to

495
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
come and take part and we also have a

496
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,799
fellowship program where anybody can

497
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,440
apply and then we choose who do we want

498
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
to to bring there

499
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
so those are the ways that you can take

500
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
part in the ripe community and

501
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
then there is ccc coming up in uh

502
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
december

503
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
where we will probably meet again

504
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,919
and they had uh uh included a lot of

505
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,480
these topics either in their regular

506
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
program um

507
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,320
when they called the conference resource

508
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
exhaustion some years ago or they have a

509
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
power like a separate conference called

510
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
uh bits and

511
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,799
trees in german which i will not try to

512
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,799
pronounce

513
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
boyme beats in boyme

514
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
and that's happening at the beginning of

515
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
october in berlin

516
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
maybe i'll have a talk i applied i

517
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,679
didn't hear yet if it will be accepted

518
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,120
but um

519
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
there will be parts of this community

520
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,559
also pre uh uh there so for me the

521
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,360
events are like these uh

522
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
regular points where we can meet up and

523
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,919
and synchronize what we are working on

524
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,039
and for the rest there is uh uh

525
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
the mailing list that i'm

526
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,600
on together with claudia and igor and

527
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
many other people that we kind of

528
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,799
started in 2013 after the

529
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,440
home conference where i for the first

530
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
time got exposed to these topics and

531
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,440
it's called uncivilization and so you

532
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
can uh you can find the link also like

533
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
deep deep deep down because uh following

534
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,799
this link because it's not work related

535
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,960
but i will write it down here anyway

536
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,600
so it's unsafe.nl

537
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,000
it's a personal uh project the website

538
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
is maintained by my partner

539
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
and

540
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,760
it just leads to a wiki where there's a

541
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
lot of links and and also the mailing

542
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
list and squirrels so

543
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
um

544
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
my obsession with squirrels

545
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
also started about that time because um

546
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
i was thinking like if this

547
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,400
uh what we're doing to the to the planet

548
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
leads to the

549
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
collapse of human society

550
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,159
fair enough we brought it on to

551
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
ourselves but what's not okay is that we

552
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
bring the squirrels with us

553
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,080
so

554
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
we really i invite you to consider the

555
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
squirrels

556
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
when making your uh

557
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
political and technical decisions

558
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
and more concretely you can take a

559
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,559
squirrel candy now

560
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,559
no that's just an illustration that was

561
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,279
at the ccc camp also where the squirrel

562
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
actually was working against the

563
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,240
technology like revenge of the squirrels

564
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
yeah

565
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,320
okay so yeah now we have time for like

566
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
discussion and

567
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,880
your contribution uh are we stopping

568
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,279
with this streaming or we we continue

569
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,960
with this

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,559
you you say yes

571
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,360
whatever i had i can have the screen the

572
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,679
streaming to two o'clock

573
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
i'm not staying until two o'clock that's

574
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,120
too much yes yes thank you um what do

575
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
you say as a streamer it's up to you i

576
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
just operate this stuff

577
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
yeah because i i really would like to

578
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
talk more about

579
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,919
you know

580
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,840
limits

581
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,600
of computing okay

582
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120
yeah if we do end up recording please

583
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
pass the microphone around yeah yes

584
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,960
yeah because i participated at one

585
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,159
conference

586
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,039
there but it was not for me it was not

587
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,360
clear what's uh uh

588
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
for instance you said that it was only

589
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
uh uh people from uh academics

590
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,400
but uh it was not really clear what was

591
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
the

592
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
you know

593
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
the goal of something it was really very

594
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
everywhere

595
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,640
um you you involved on organizing the

596
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,120
limits of computing uh conference also

597
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,039
no yeah

598
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,520
so i'm not involved in organizing it but

599
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,480
they do know a lot of people who are

600
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
and

601
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,559
the the program committee is really

602
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,279
mostly academics from a lot of different

603
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
universities and it goes

604
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
around it's hosted by different

605
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,039
universities and so they try to make it

606
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,960
as

607
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,320
multi-disciplinary as possible

608
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
but still it's very

609
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,480
um

610
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,840
how can i say like

611
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,520
um it's hard for the people who are not

612
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
academics to even suggest the paper

613
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,919
because you have to write it in that

614
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,520
format like

615
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
so even if they're artists and activists

616
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
like um

617
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
like this project of hologram they have

618
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
to kind of pair up with somebody who

619
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
knows how to submit that kind of format

620
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
of paper

621
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,960
which which is okayish like you have to

622
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
work in in different groups

623
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
um like in in a group that has multiple

624
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,120
kind of

625
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
skill sets um but it does make it uh

626
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
difficult to to

627
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
join so this is

628
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
one of the problems that i see across

629
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,799
many communities they're so focused on

630
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,600
their own jargon and that there is so

631
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
much translation needed

632
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
between different approaches like this

633
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,080
is academic

634
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
approach and so if i would invite them

635
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
to to the right meeting they would be

636
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
like well why should i talk to the

637
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,080
network operators how can i talk to the

638
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
network operators and the other way

639
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
around if somebody from the network

640
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
operators would want to

641
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
submit the work here

642
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,799
it's just so difficult to

643
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,240
uh translate our way of speaking to so

644
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
that's why we try to organize a join

645
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,279
meet a workshop at the next academic

646
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
conference this sig com

647
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
and then you have to pay a ticket like

648
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
for one day workshop it's a lot of money

649
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
for people who are not really getting

650
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
anything out of it the same for the

651
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
right meeting like when we invite

652
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,399
speakers from outside of our community

653
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,799
there is so many obstacles there well

654
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,960
the same for mch like some people found

655
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,480
it very expensive so there is economic

656
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
um

657
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,600
aspect of why

658
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
this crossover is not happening so there

659
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,279
is economic blockages the the jargon

660
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
and

661
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,279
yeah like it's not your

662
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
own group so you're not gonna go about

663
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
that

664
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
yes

665
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,799
yeah so that's why it's important to

666
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,360
have these crossovers and to tell people

667
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,120
like but you could take part there

668
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,200
and um

669
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
the very important factor that is now

670
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
making things much easier is that uh

671
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,080
we are moving online so that's both like

672
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
you you don't have to be there

673
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,279
physically you don't have to travel you

674
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
don't have to pay

675
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
um

676
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,520
you can just use zoom

677
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,799
for the limit for mch for ripe like for

678
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,880
everything like if you can't afford to

679
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
go there physically either because you

680
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,480
don't have money or you don't have time

681
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
or you have small kids that you have to

682
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,760
take care of you

683
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,159
you can still participate so this is

684
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,200
great

685
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
on the other hand

686
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,679
it's

687
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,240
it's great to some extent because what

688
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
is the cost of doing the double

689
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,039
conference doing it in person and

690
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,120
actually streaming everything we don't

691
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
know what the cost is we think

692
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,000
it's actually not too bad but but we

693
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,320
don't know because partially because

694
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
it's hard to calculate and partially

695
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,919
because we don't want to know because

696
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,559
then do we have to cut it out like do we

697
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,799
not meet in person or do we not stream

698
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,520
it

699
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
and uh yeah it's it's really hard

700
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,440
but but i think i think uh

701
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
people would be more comfortable if if

702
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
you know for sure what the cost is of

703
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,279
your action that you could

704
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,559
act on

705
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,840
on on your costs so that's that's this

706
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
kind of thing is what i expected talk so

707
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,840
from the limits of computing and

708
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,520
you know i didn't know anything about it

709
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,039
and i wanted the conference it was a

710
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,919
conference and i was like puzzles and

711
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
and because i really expected something

712
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,320
very practical in this way

713
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,080
it is practical uh that they do have a

714
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
paper published on like you know

715
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,279
one hour of streaming doesn't matter if

716
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,200
it's netflix or this

717
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
uh costs like driving a car for two

718
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
kilometers so some people would but then

719
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
is it individual

720
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,279
or not like does it take 100 people does

721
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,919
it does the cost decrease

722
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,600
if just one person is watching the

723
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
stream or there's thousand people

724
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,399
watching the stream is it still

725
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,520
thousand times two kilometers

726
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
or is it divided by thousand people

727
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
and what is the cost of storing it

728
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
so that other thousand people can see it

729
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
five years from now

730
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,240
in the data center which has to then run

731
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,039
24 7 so that maybe on an off chance

732
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,440
somebody is going to want to watch this

733
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
video

734
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,399
and

735
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,799
if i have to say like don't store this

736
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,399
because i don't want to kill the

737
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,480
squirrels because somebody might want to

738
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
watch me on a video five years from now

739
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
does it matter

740
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,679
like does it like does it is it going to

741
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
switch off the data center for five

742
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,399
minutes so that my video won't be stored

743
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,159
there

744
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,640
it's it and it's not about personal cost

745
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,679
i think it's really about the systemic

746
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,039
yeah

747
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,159
but to

748
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,200
to act as a at a personal level when you

749
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
do something you want to know uh you

750
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,880
know what's the what's what's my uh you

751
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,840
know ecological footprint here in this

752
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,480
action and would really help and a lot

753
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
of things also to

754
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,960
to

755
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,799
to allow people to make decisions

756
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,840
i think that it is part of um denial

757
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
that that that we enjoy i personally

758
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
also enjoy because and somebody else in

759
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,919
some other presentation said recently

760
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
like one of the oh it was alvin one of

761
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,799
the answers is like but we need more

762
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,240
measurements

763
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,720
no we don't we know it's too much we

764
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
don't know how much how how much too

765
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,279
much it is but it's definitely too much

766
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,600
and and then the the the then the

767
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
follow-up action would be but let's not

768
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,240
do it

769
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
but i don't want to say that because i

770
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760
enjoy it too much

771
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,039
it's not only that it's so so like uh uh

772
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,240
i was reading a paper about uh like the

773
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,960
mechanisms uh emotional mechanisms

774
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
towards uh very emotions towards uh

775
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,399
uh climate change uh

776
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,760
one of the

777
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,880
most used mechanisms seems to be this so

778
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,720
well i don't know if i they say well

779
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,240
that you minimize your cost but uh uh

780
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
the thing is like everything you know

781
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
you you're living it's uh it's uh it's

782
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,519
too much so

783
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,600
we have to make like a more informed

784
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
choice but with less

785
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,720
uh uh

786
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,159
paralysis

787
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
because this causes paralysis but if you

788
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
if you can choose you know knowingly

789
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,679
more you know you don't have to be very

790
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,120
very speci

791
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,880
well as specific as possible but you you

792
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,279
know it it leaves you some emotional

793
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,679
space to make uh uh good uh decisions

794
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,919
yeah okay i'd like to pass the mic to

795
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,360
other people um yes

796
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,039
um i really

797
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,640
i would like to have the name of the

798
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
paper that you mentioned about um

799
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
that self-hosting is more efficient

800
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,039
because

801
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,279
i have been told that yeah no people

802
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,960
should go to the cloud and it's also

803
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
more green and i've been teaching people

804
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
that because people explain it to me

805
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
like yeah you share the resources and i

806
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
thought that sounds nice

807
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,320
but so i was also wondering maybe if you

808
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,480
could elaborate a little bit more now or

809
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,559
someone else if they have

810
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,840
more information about it

811
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,679
so this specific paper is called

812
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,519
conceptualizing resource aware

813
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,399
higher education digital infrastructure

814
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,559
it's a very long title but uh you can

815
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,519
find it back through through this link

816
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,480
um

817
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,600
and or just computing within limits uh

818
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,480
the all the the main author is l

819
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
uh angeli

820
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,000
so you can look it up that way and um

821
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
of course it is uh controversial like

822
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,720
they probably had

823
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,960
uh their own favorite outcome and then

824
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,519
they did the research towards that

825
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,960
um

826
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,519
on the other hand it's not only about

827
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,199
economic like energy efficiency but it's

828
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,679
there are other elements in like why the

829
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,040
self-hosting

830
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,239
is better

831
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,119
than

832
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
outsourcing everything

833
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,560
to the cloud so they probably took those

834
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,719
things into account and and what i like

835
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,159
about it is

836
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,399
um the ethical aspects which is

837
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,639
um

838
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,000
avoiding the consolidation towards few

839
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,199
actors

840
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,320
uh avoiding the loss of autonomy and um

841
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
not delegating your sustainability

842
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,119
choices to a third party

843
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,719
so that's um

844
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,000
that's worth something too even if

845
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,480
um

846
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
the if energy efficiency aspects are

847
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
questionable

848
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,880
but i think they also mention because

849
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
their academics they mention other

850
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,200
papers within their paper so then you

851
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,800
can look like look it up cross-reference

852
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
and like choose your own

853
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,720
bits to confirm your own decisions um

854
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,520
because yeah that is the the beauty and

855
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
and the tragedy of all this like

856
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,800
academic research like there is so much

857
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,359
knowledge and so much information that

858
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,599
that proves anything

859
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,359
and then we still have to choose

860
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,078
anybody else

861
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,879
no

862
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,040
i want to finish in a on a

863
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,599
nice note let me see how um

864
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,520
oh yeah no well let me talk about some

865
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,720
more interesting ones so there was

866
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,160
something about

867
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,800
solar protocol exploring energy center

868
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
design

869
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,040
and then an interesting one called smart

870
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,240
enough or too smart about smart cities

871
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,040
so

872
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,839
uh like that's very iot

873
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,880
uh

874
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,839
yeah within the iot um topics and

875
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,920
but of course they brought it up with

876
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
the

877
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,640
um

878
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,839
intersectionality to

879
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,240
a different aspect which is saying

880
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
how

881
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,960
all these smart devices um

882
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
actually

883
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
replace

884
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
or are aiming to replace the emotional

885
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
labor so they call that uh social

886
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,359
reproduction so how does this

887
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,040
technological solution actually impact

888
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
the areas in our life that that

889
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,599
do not have to be governed by the the

890
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
internet of things or things at all

891
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,079
so and then they also um

892
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,040
mention the concept of

893
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,359
digital circus circuits of dispossession

894
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,440
so what does it take away from us

895
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,960
leaving

896
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
the decisions making to algorithms and

897
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,280
things

898
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,480
so yeah i'm having goosebumps

899
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,400
it's really like science fiction

900
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,040
material but then uh

901
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,760
in in reality oh yeah and a very very

902
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,480
cool project or paper about that i

903
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,680
thought would fit in the mch

904
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,800
so well

905
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,640
it was called

906
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,359
omni food exploring the possibilities of

907
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,960
a consumer system with a big ubiquitous

908
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
access to data about the food we eat

909
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
so making choices

910
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,240
based on the artificial intelligence

911
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,040
machine learning uh things and stuff

912
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,599
about what you eat by so they did it in

913
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,560
sweden and they they had several

914
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
methods of of getting to that goal which

915
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,560
is

916
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
um

917
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
intercepting

918
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
the data between your

919
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,839
hand held scanner

920
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,240
and uh

921
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,880
the computer that like produces your

922
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,040
bill like how much you have to pay for

923
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
for

924
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
the things you bought

925
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,800
by also printing the

926
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,680
uh ecological footprint information

927
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,400
about

928
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
every item with color coding and like

929
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,079
looking it up in the databases which are

930
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,960
open

931
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,400
and just saying like well this avocado

932
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,440
traveled from brazil to sweden

933
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,599
or this meat has been grown locally so

934
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,119
it is meat

935
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,599
so that's like really bad but at least

936
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,079
it didn't travel from whatever like

937
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,960
holland and so that that's one way and

938
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
then the other way was when you order

939
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,640
things online and then it like shows you

940
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,160
you know what are you going to buy and

941
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,359
stuff and then it also shows you like

942
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,640
this is the ecological footprint

943
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,800
um yeah

944
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
impact

945
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,880
where i live there is a ecological

946
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,800
supermarket that's labeling uh the foods

947
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,359
on the real price of the food you buy

948
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,480
which is very cool

949
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,720
yeah so so there is there is work to be

950
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,680
done in this area um

951
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,480
but it is also a lot of um i'm sorry

952
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,280
else i'll elsewhere in dutch miranoken

953
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,240
because it's like you you don't really

954
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
have to know how expensive that meat is

955
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,800
it's just too expensive like on the

956
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
planet like so

957
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
uh the same like what i'm saying like

958
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
for the technology like we say we need

959
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
more measurements but actually we know

960
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,440
the answer but we just don't like it

961
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
um

962
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
you know it's also kind of i think it's

963
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
a kind of shaming people

964
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,320
also but it works you know i i don't

965
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,800
know everything that works it's uh i

966
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
really welcome you know if you buy

967
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
something they say well okay you buying

968
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,119
feel ashamed you buy something that's

969
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,880
gonna destroy

970
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,640
everything you like

971
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
you know

972
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,759
yeah like tesla

973
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,920
okay let me let me read some of these

974
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,000
slides because uh it's it's actually

975
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
hard but uh just to end on a like more

976
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,200
tech

977
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,000
related so how to do the d growth

978
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,200
computing

979
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,760
extend the useful lives of computers

980
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
uh reuse instead of recycling reuse as

981
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
energy storage like information

982
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,119
batteries

983
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
uh and make

984
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,680
out

985
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,920
target systems

986
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,839
whatever that means

987
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
uh you can you can look up like the

988
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,040
details there then um

989
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
use computers more extensively so share

990
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,200
the unused time

991
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,960
uh broadly define computers so like

992
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,280
consider all the things that actually

993
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,000
have computing power in them but we

994
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,079
don't really think of them as computers

995
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,160
but they actually are and then use all

996
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,079
the other tips for that

997
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,200
um

998
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,920
and um

999
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,560
create the low power standardized

1000
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,400
smaller footprint

1001
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,000
devices

1002
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,800
and then the third was

1003
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,680
the growth design

1004
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,000
so

1005
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,480
consider this the growth in the software

1006
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,680
engineering

1007
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
uh use the

1008
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,520
flexible computing with

1009
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,280
uh the view of intermittent energy so if

1010
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,720
you have the

1011
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,520
uh like renewable energy sources they do

1012
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,480
not give consistent energy so design for

1013
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
that

1014
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,839
in the design stage and then use the

1015
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,359
open design and the right to repair

1016
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,640
and

1017
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,400
use the growth for the hardware

1018
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,960
engineering so

1019
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,839
not don't wait until you actually have a

1020
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,000
hardware that can do certain things and

1021
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
then try tweaking software for it but

1022
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,119
use the engineering of hardware with the

1023
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,400
growth in mind from the beginning

1024
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
but a lot of these are kind of

1025
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,240
contradictory because that would mean

1026
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
designing new hardware but the first one

1027
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,440
was reuse the existing hardware so

1028
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,480
uh they have to be considered in the

1029
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,839
balance of what what is available

1030
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,079
and what your goal is so

1031
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,720
this is where i want to end

1032
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
and thank you very much for

1033
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,440
