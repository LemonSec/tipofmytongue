2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
yesterday i heralded this lovely session

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,000
that we were about to listen to

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,720
because i think it's very important that

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
we all have an awareness

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,599
what to do when we lose someone

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,560
i think

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
you did a great job yesterday it was

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
lovely and i'm really looking forward to

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,000
this one

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,320
um

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,079
[Music]

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,680
they were doing it again because the

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
audio wasn't recorded

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
so now um yeah

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,280
i think you practiced yesterday and now

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,200
it's for the real thing maybe

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
um we met first

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
uh in real life yesterday while

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
following each other for years i guess

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
so that was really nice so when i heard

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,480
that they were going to do the talk

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,359
again

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
um i just

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
felt compelled to be their herald again

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,360
and i'm i'm really grateful and thankful

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640

so

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,640
um i'm going to start this talk off with

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
a trigger warning

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
we are going to mention

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
suicide

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
a lot

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
and if you are not capable of

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
hearing withstanding or talking about

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
that topic i recommend you leave now

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
you've got about the next 30 35 seconds

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,119

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,640
to leave and afterwards we're going a

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,479
full steam ahead

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,079
lead to

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,960

to be here again

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
this is

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,518
like a

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,239
thing that i really needed

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,840
this camp

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,480
so for me this is woodstock for hackers

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
there's like so much interaction with

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,959
all the people with all the new friends

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
that we made

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,080
i really really really enjoyed it

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
um

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
but we had another one

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,120
uh

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
[Music]

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
a few years ago five years ago to be

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,959
exact

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
and it was xiao 2017

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
and yesterday i woke up at like 3 a.m in

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
the night

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
and i realized that

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,200
it was the day

96
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
we went to camp

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,799
just before my mother died

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
and at that time my colleagues came to

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,120
my house so i opened the door

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
so i said you're way too early

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
the funeral is just in the in the

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
afternoon he said well we want to tell

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
you that

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,359
a yoast has been stepped

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,599
step to death

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
in the metro in amsterdam

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,439
so

108
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,959
we don't want

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,798
to

110
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,839
have you heard hear it in the news

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
so

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,840
during the funeral i

113
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,199
actually mentioned

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
like my appreciation for him but i just

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
realized

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,240
that that's like five years ago

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
so

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,759
it is kind of hard

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,680
like

120
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,280
re-experiencing it

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
sorry i don't have

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
any

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
any voice anymore

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,758
but

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
i think it's important that you are able

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
to show your feelings and you should not

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
be shared to show your feelings

128
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
but it makes it

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,800
harder than like an average day

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,759
i don't know anymore like

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,639
yeah

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
are you going to like the next one or

133
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,199
was i

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
so this all started out as just

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
something that we got

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
more skilled

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
than an average person right we are

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
in a situation where we can

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
do stuff that the average person can't

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
talking about

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,280
installing an app on windows or

142
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
deleting an email from a

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
from a mailing list or your email server

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,199
there are some people that still

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
struggle with that

146
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
um

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,319
we are of course as like a community but

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
also we personally

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
have um

150
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
have some skills that other people do

151
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
not have

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,520
and um

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
because of that let me take it from

154
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
there sorry go ahead um so

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
at first you you skill yourself

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
so you become like the smart nephew you

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,639
will be able to help other people

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,840
so you

159
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
install like a new hard disk

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
upgrade your screen

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
install like a graphics card maybe fix

162
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,600
something recover hardware

163
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
and people know

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,840
how to find

165
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
you it's okay yeah thanks

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,479
so they know how to find you and

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
you help them out with all kinds of

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,759
problems

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
and sometimes those problems are like

170
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,319
really odd problems

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
uh

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
one of the the situations i had

173
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
a person that was like

174
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,280
having roman romantic ids with like the

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,319
the partner sharing like a picture and

176
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
that picture turned out to be like the

177
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,479
background of the computer

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
and there was like the same pc that was

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
used like for schoolwork

180
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
you get a call can you help me out we

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
don't have to see each other

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
make sure that that it works

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
so

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,919
that requires a lot of trust for calling

185
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
someone in to fixing some sort of

186
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
problem that you're not like familiar

187
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,039
with

188
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,130
you're not tech savvy

189
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,680
[Music]

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,240
and i think that's what this story is

191
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
about

192
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,120
so

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
we're here to help and like we're not

194
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
here to

195
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
be your unpaid id department so there's

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
like people telling you

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
can you install an illegal version of

198
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
windows

199
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
i don't like two-factor authentication i

200
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
don't like

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
having different passwords

202
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,440
we're not fixing people here so

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
we like to help but we like to help in a

204
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
different way

205
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
and

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
this work the work that we do the work

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,160
that we're about to tell about

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,039
is

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,080
work that we're not applied for

210
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,199
it is

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
we are not looking for that work but

212
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,599
that works actually looking for us

213
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
so

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
my first

215
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,919
situation was a family member

216
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,559
a remote family member

217
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
um

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
that committed suicide

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,640
and did not leave a note so there was no

220
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
like clear situation

221
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
if the person

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,360
did it like consciousness uh did it

223
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,040
was like uh influenced by someone else

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
so the uh the family reached out to me

225
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
at that time

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
i was playing with computers but i was

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
not as

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,279
professional as i was now

229
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
and it turned out that person

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,560
had all kinds of measures to protect his

231
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,440
invention for others to

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
be found so

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
to be able to get to the hard disk you

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,360
need to like hold a special magnet on a

235
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
special place to enable it

236
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,000
data was like encrypted in pictures in

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
uh

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
in audio in all kinds of ways so i

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
learned a lot about all kind of

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
different

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,120
methods by like googling stack overflow

242
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
wikipedia and then downloading the

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,279
different tools to

244
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,839
help and do

245
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,959
that so

246
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,720
if you do this work

247
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
you run into all kinds of stuff

248
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,959
so

249
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,040
you need to be

250
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
careful and you need to be considerate

251
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
for the people that you're you are doing

252
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
this work for

253
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,079
so first of all you don't go and

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
compromise crime scenes so before

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,160
police has been there and released the

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,279
scene you don't go like

257
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
taking stuff apart you don't

258
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,440
touch anything

259
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
if someone is still alive respect

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
their choice so it's not my and this

261
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
these are not the guidelines these are

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
just our guidelines but

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
don't tamper with the data of the living

264
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,839
there's like gdpr there's avg

265
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,800
uh

266
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,680
we're not doing that so we only

267
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
want to help the

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
relatives of people

269
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
that actually died

270
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
be respectful and validate the relatives

271
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
desires

272
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,000
so

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
it can be like really cool to find

274
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,880
something but if that's not what the

275
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
relatives are looking for you're look

276
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
looking for the wrong thing

277
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
so manage the expectations inform them

278
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
tell them

279
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,839
these are the options that you have it's

280
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
going to take so much time

281
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,560
to actually do that what do you want me

282
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,359
to do first

283
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
never work on the original

284
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,839
make sure that you are

285
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,160
um forensically safe

286
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
so using a big hard disk

287
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
to be able to make a mirror and work on

288
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,959
the mirror

289
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
sometimes you need to validate that the

290
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
information that you find is the correct

291
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
information

292
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,279
having one picture is enough to validate

293
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
that it is the correct one don't

294
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
go and browse around someone's private

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
life

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
and make sure that you are stable enough

297
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,079
to do this work yourself so in my

298
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
current situation

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
i would not be able to cope with it

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
right now so i need to have a stable

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
mindset

302
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
and

303
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
we are doing this

304
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
together

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
and that's both from a stability mindset

306
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
so he can look over me and i can look

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
over him

308
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
uh but as well as if you do not like

309
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,639
have fancy celebrate hardware and you

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,959
need to like copy stuff and it's like

311
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,040
really really easy you have the dd

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
command that you run if you have the if

313
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
and of wrong you destroy everything and

314
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,959
if someone is watching over your

315
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,000
shoulder

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,800
tire

317
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,590
looking at what you type you actually

318
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,000
[Music]

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,639
prevent making unnecessary mistakes

320
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,440
and something that is not on the screen

321
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,800
here is that

322
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
we do this like on-premise so we don't

323
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
take any information home the disk that

324
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,560
we use we wipe them before

325
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
so

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,920
the first

327
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
like assignment that i did i was on

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
location and i brought my camping

329
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,079
equipment stayed there for a couple of

330
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,399
days to see what i could find

331
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
um and to come back on the point of

332
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
being stable enough

333
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
right now there is

334
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
a lot of things going on

335
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,120
we

336
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
were just in a lockdown

337
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
it's luckily already receding a bit

338
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
crossing my fingers for the monkey thing

339
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,959
um but we are in a very very

340
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
yeah bad situation mentally

341
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
um i think as a whole world

342
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
um

343
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,720
and i can see that in my group as well

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
right so i am

345
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,079
bisexual i am very active within um

346
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,199
a bunch of

347
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,959
very very queer groups

348
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,560
uh trans rights are human rights by the

349
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,560
way

350
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,519
[Applause]

351
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,040
the fact that we applaud for that

352
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,399
shouldn't have to be nice but thank you

353
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
but yeah we are in we are in situations

354
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
where

355
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,199
people

356
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,279
are

357
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,800
being forced back into their home

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
because of economical situations housing

359
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,839
is

360
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
almost unpayable with you know with the

361
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
current measures that we as students

362
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
have access to and a lot of people have

363
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
get like fourth back in situations where

364
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,199
they

365
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
wanted to get out of they might be

366
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
queer with religious or abusive parents

367
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
they might just not be in a safe

368
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
situation at home anymore and i

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,760
noticed that

370
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
within the community i'm in both queer

371
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
communities student communities team

372
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,000
communities

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
there is a

374
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
loss of morale and a lot of

375
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
yeah negative

376
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
yeah negative mindsets

377
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,360
which i unfortunately can 100 understand

378
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
and i sometimes experience those things

379
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,360
myself as well not the whole parents

380
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,199
thing you guys are awesome by the way

381
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,240
but

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
like there are some emotions that i and

383
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,480
many many others struggle with um and

384
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
stuff like that can come very very close

385
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,279
so i did a um a case of this where

386
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,000
i found out that the person i was uh who

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,839
have at the end of their life was

388
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
actually in the same discord as i as

389
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
with watching the same youtube channel

390
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,519
that i had had the same hobbies as i had

391
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,399
and

392
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
it got very very close so

393
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
be sure that when you or if you do

394
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
accept a job like this that you are in a

395
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,000
mental state

396
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,839
that you could that you can actually do

397
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
this right because if i got that job

398
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
added to me a few months earlier i would

399
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
not have been there

400
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,320
so yeah be careful um about your own

401
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
mental health as well you come first

402
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
you're not a therapist you're not some

403
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
kind of magician you can help out but

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,759
your own mental health comes first

405
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
i want to add to that that this is a

406
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
safe place

407
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,519
like this is where people can be

408
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
whomever they truly are

409
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
and i really value this of this

410
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
community

411
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
and we see that also when we go together

412
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
me dressed up funny as a unicorn to

413
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
comic-con

414
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
that is also like a safe place a place

415
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
to escape for people people that are

416
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
trans people that are called by uh their

417
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
dead names by their parents

418
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,079
uh

419
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
trans rights are human rights people

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,199
so

421
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
i think it is really important that we

422
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,199
are

423
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,599
um

424
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
being really

425
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,639
kind and caring for the people in

426
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
difficult situations

427
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,199
and i've seen the hackerspaces

428
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,240
become a safe haven during the covert

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
times

430
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
to shelter people that were in different

431
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,680
difficult situations so i really value

432
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
this community

433
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
yeah it is very important to have some

434
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
sort of safe space and that could be

435
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
within the comic uh comic-con community

436
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,319
like anime that could be within the

437
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
furry community that could be within the

438
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
hacker community it could be even within

439
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
your own school or without friend groups

440
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,839
it's just very important to have a space

441
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,520
like this and i think it's very nice

442
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,480
that

443
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,800
um

444
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,079
[Music]

445
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,200
that hacker spaces are as open as

446
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
and as accepting as they are

447
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
yeah

448
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
so

449
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
a couple of object

450
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,080
objectives that we run into in the

451
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
assignments that

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
both you and i did and that i did alone

453
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
is like find answers

454
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,559
to

455
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,200
questions

456
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
like why

457
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
were other people involved

458
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
suicides without goodbye notes

459
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,640
but sometimes you run into like

460
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
really odd situations

461
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
so there was one where there was like a

462
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
ctf style farewell note

463
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
and then you're actually

464
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
playing a game

465
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
about someone's life

466
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,120
so

467
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
it is really cool to play cdf but like

468
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
with this on steak it's very hard

469
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,360
recovering lost pictures being able to

470
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,720
make a

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
presentation a lecture for the funeral

472
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,960
removing someone's footprint

473
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,039
being able to

474
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,039
interact with big tech that has no

475
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
use for helping you with these kind of

476
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,600
things because yeah there's actually

477
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
no commercial incentive to to help out

478
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
and one of the last things that that i

479
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,960
did

480
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,120
was help someone out to validate a story

481
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,799
because someone

482
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,919
could have been misdiagnosed with a

483
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,400
mental disorder

484
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,960
prior to a suicide attempt

485
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,559
so

486
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,520
we do a lot of cool stuff together i

487
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
think we did like two three hundred

488
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
talks lectures workshops trainings

489
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
and

490
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
i

491
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,960
am

492
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
surprised every time with

493
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
the

494
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
speed that he like

495
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,799
chases me and

496
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
runs like far ahead of me

497
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
so

498
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
uh when it's like father's day or when

499
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
it's my birthday he actually creates

500
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
ctfs for me

501
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
and that takes me like a couple of weeks

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
to solve

503
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
so we have a way when we are playing ctf

504
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
together and it's like embedded in our

505
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
life document everything make sure that

506
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,200
you have evidence we use onenote as a

507
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
tool so i will be

508
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,640
doing like the shell scripts with the

509
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,240
one-liners while he is doing python and

510
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
sometimes

511
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,559
i win but in most of the cases he does

512
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
but that is like the same technique that

513
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
is like embedded in our lives so

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
document the entire process

515
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
but you also need like to bring tools

516
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,320
so

517
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
if you're going to

518
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
work on data

519
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,880
and you only have one chance well if you

520
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,520
are

521
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
doing it forensically solid and make

522
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
sure there's like chain of evidence make

523
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
sure that that you work on mirrors

524
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
uh then if you cannot fix it you can

525
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
always escalate to someone that is

526
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
capable of doing that so bring

527
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
discs bring different discs bring

528
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
operating systems

529
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,400
bring tools to mirror data

530
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
sata patha scusi whatever so we have

531
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
like a box of gear that allows us to do

532
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
mirroring

533
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
uh we don't have all the fancy stuff so

534
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,320
we're doing it like on my palper hosting

535
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
solutions but

536
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
it does

537
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
work

538
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
and like all of the knowledge that we

539
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
build up over the years on like

540
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
different operating system different

541
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,880
architecture different technology that

542
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
really comes to use uh doing this work

543
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
and most of the times

544
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
it is for the

545
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,960
technically

546
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
not savvy people so

547
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,559
someone in the household is doing

548
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
the attacks

549
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,200
someone is like uh keeping all the

550
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
pictures on the disk

551
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,840
and another person is not able to

552
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
find everything because they are not

553
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
used to working with computers they

554
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,760
don't know where the data is so

555
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,320
a simple grep dash is

556
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
on a specific keyword will actually

557
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
be a world

558
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,919
of change for someone that actually

559
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
finds whatever they need

560
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
or a strings on a document

561
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
and sometimes it's like simple plugins

562
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
as a grease monkey

563
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
where you can like override data so if

564
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,760
someone wants to remove the digital

565
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
footprint it's not just a matter of

566
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
enabling a switch and everything is gone

567
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,799
yeah i really had a hard time

568
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,360
removing the digital footprint and i

569
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
scripted everything it took me like a

570
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
month to

571
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
have all the scripts running for like

572
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,679
unliking unfriending

573
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
removing posts overwriting data with

574
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
garbage information

575
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
it's like yeah stuff that you do over

576
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,520
time

577
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,320
and just as in commercial work where you

578
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,360
have

579
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
where you are paid for an amount of

580
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,760
hours or an amount of days being

581
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,919
available you have the same stuff too

582
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
when you're working on this

583
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,420
so

584
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,760
[Music]

585
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
that first assignment that i did the

586
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,039
person had like over 100 hard disks so

587
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
where do you start yeah obviously on the

588
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,200
ones that are in the computer but if you

589
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
are you are finished are you going to

590
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
work on everything together are you

591
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
looking at like the dates on the disk

592
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
are you looking at

593
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,240
is this a clean one or a dusty one so

594
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,919
um

595
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
and on the the ctf one

596
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
stuff was

597
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,080
stored on accounts accounts that expired

598
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
services that stopped working

599
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
phone numbers that were terminated so no

600
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,320
longer having the the second factor

601
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,880
so we already talked about the

602
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
emotional part so it's the the personal

603
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
struggles but also like the similarities

604
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
like like you said someone in the in the

605
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
same age or uh like a a family member or

606
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,279
someone in the same community

607
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
and yeah sometimes you run into like

608
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
really

609
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
special stuff like the steganography or

610
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,840
like the tripwires the mechanical uh

611
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
ones

612
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,919
but

613
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,679
those are just the people that are not

614
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,840
tax heavy but we are all

615
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,039
i.t professionals at least i assume and

616
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
yeah to assume this

617
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
but we try to protect ourselves so we

618
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,679
encrypt our stuff because otherwise

619
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,240
people will say we are crazy so we have

620
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,400
a dm clip we have a bit locker we have a

621
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
two factor

622
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,679
we use a ub key we have a telephone

623
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,360
number

624
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
but what happens

625
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
if you are no longer there is your

626
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,360
partner able to get to your data did you

627
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,480
make like an understanding about that to

628
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
give access

629
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
to

630
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,080
yeah to your partner

631
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,200
so there are some of the results

632
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,760
and i think the most important one is

633
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,120
the ease of mind for the relatives so if

634
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,159
a case is closed then it's just like it

635
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,240
ends here and if someone

636
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,200
that is willing to help you out and find

637
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,799
the answers

638
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
is doing their best to come up with

639
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
solutions

640
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
then at least you've tried

641
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
so you did everything that you could so

642
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,840
it's easier to give it

643
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,720
yeah to leave it at rest

644
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
we were able to uh

645
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,039
at last

646
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
remove the digital footprint

647
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,679
at least the visible side it probably is

648
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,840
still on the

649
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
on the the machines themselves but we

650
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,480
don't no longer see it we were able to

651
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,120
create a slideshow for the servers

652
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,039
in time to show a proper service

653
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,600
we were able to recover the data of a

654
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
telephone that was wiped because

655
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
three different tries were put in and

656
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
the machine was white and we got the

657
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,080
story validated

658
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,480
so

659
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
i have a colleague and that colleague

660
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,080
really really likes to travel

661
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,559
but yeah there's like certain dangers

662
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,120
especially when you're like going to

663
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
a

664
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,520
yeah a different country like a rough

665
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,640
country

666
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
so something can happen to you your your

667
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
plank can crash

668
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,760
but it's like really really secure and i

669
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
i really really admire that colleague he

670
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
has like

671
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
over thought everything like in such a

672
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,679
way like this is

673
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
this is like legit this is solid

674
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
but

675
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,159
what happens if he dies what happens

676
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,480
with his pictures there's

677
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
no

678
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
partner to share the data

679
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
and he does like share the data

680
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
in a distribution way a distributed way

681
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
so what he did is like create a qr code

682
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
gave that qr code to his parents and in

683
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
case something happens to him they will

684
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
call me

685
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
and show the qr code so that i will be

686
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,120
able to do the next steps required so no

687
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
one is able to get in

688
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,480
unless

689
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,320
unless necessary but you could also

690
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,919
use a

691
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,520
password vault

692
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,760
and

693
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
[Music]

694
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,720
like we are using uh one password as a

695
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,240
family

696
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,200
by the way

697
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
sorry not sponsored by the way

698
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
not sponsored by the way no not

699
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,279
sponsored by it no no no no you can do

700
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,600
whatever you want uh use keepers or

701
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,159
whatever but what i really like about it

702
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,279
is like

703
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,080
you have to share a shared box so we

704
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,880
have stuff that we can share amongst the

705
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
family so if they want to watch netflix

706
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
that they can and we can change the

707
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,080
password and will still work

708
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
and you can make like a special

709
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,279
master password for a vault that

710
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,440
contains important stuff for when you're

711
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,919
no longer there and store it like in in

712
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,840
a secure way so

713
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,279
that it is still possible

714
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
but at least think about this uh think

715
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,559
about your own situation

716
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,640
write down your uh

717
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,600
and discuss your lost wishes so uh

718
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
yesterday donnie was here and shared the

719
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
link it is on twitter i will retweet it

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
today again there was like a

721
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
last wishes

722
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,799
website that allowed you to really

723
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,240
overthink all the stuff

724
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,200
so

725
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,320
initially this talk was uh set up as a

726
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
technical talk for people to

727
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,559
uh

728
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,240
to motivate them to work on this uh from

729
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,840
a

730
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
technology perspective but the first

731
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,760
time we gave it it turned out that there

732
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,799
were like

733
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,520
20 percent of the audience was actually

734
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,399
affected by the the subject so either

735
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,000
having a partner committing suicide

736
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
children

737
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,960
colleagues

738
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,399
so

739
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,480
it became quite an emotional one

740
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
but what happens if someone starts about

741
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,799
the the topic

742
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
what do you do

743
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,080
they make a joke like the the thing that

744
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,279
your gut says is like come on it's okay

745
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,039
look at the weather no no not look at

746
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,640
this weather but

747
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,799
we're all with hackers here so it's like

748
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,880
a really cool situation

749
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,440
but in fact that is not how it works and

750
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
i will come back to that later but also

751
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,679
if someone like gets a heart attack

752
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,840
are you able to handle and like we are

753
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,279
like in a

754
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
beautiful environment in a great

755
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
community and there's like first eight

756
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
on site but if you like camping remote

757
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,679
are you able like to help out your

758
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,120
partner

759
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
and you don't have to learn it like if

760
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
you are working in a company they are

761
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,679
always looking for volunteers to do like

762
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
the company of first aid and you know

763
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
how to learn how to extinguish fires and

764
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,840
you know how to

765
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,720
try and help save a life

766
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,600
so consider that

767
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
yeah doing that as well

768
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
so

769
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,320
a friend of mine who's no longer here

770
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,279
talked about suicide a lot and

771
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,120
i uh

772
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
had conversations with him

773
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
about

774
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
what was going on in his

775
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,200
his mind i never said uh it is all okay

776
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
i just want to hear his story

777
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,250
like be sincere

778
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,760
[Music]

779
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,799
if you

780
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,200
have someone that

781
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
suggests that they're not

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
their lives not valuable enough

783
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,120
tell them

784
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
sincerely take time take them apart

785
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,720
are you really considering committing

786
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
suicide do you already have thoughts

787
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
about it do you have it planned do you

788
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
know how to do it and it really feels

789
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,080
counter intuitive

790
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,200
but

791
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
by saying it will all be okay you're

792
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,840
actually actually dismissing this

793
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,279
person's

794
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,039
feelings well if you are taking the time

795
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,000
and

796
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
talking about the subject you're

797
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
actually giving them breathing space so

798
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
they're able to share their story and

799
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,039
you will be able to like triage the

800
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,000
situation like do i need to interact now

801
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,519
or do i need to

802
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,760
uh like be there for for them

803
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,720
so

804
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,279
there's a training that you can can

805
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,399
follow

806
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,440
so

807
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
one of the cases that i did

808
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,919
in the the goal lock was a number one

809
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,440
one three

810
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
so the person actually reached out to

811
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,519
the situation

812
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,159
to see and find if he uh the the person

813
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,519
could get help

814
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,240
but one one three was not operational

815
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,200
one one three was at that time uh 109

816
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,159
hundred

817
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,399
one one three even though they said they

818
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
were one one three and actually the

819
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,399
parents made sure

820
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
the and fought to have it like the the

821
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,360
the shortened number

822
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,519
so the number on the right is all the

823
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,000
international numbers for every country

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
that you visit

825
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
and the ones the two on the left

826
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,640
are

827
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,559
trainings that you can follow to

828
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,519
do role play on these kind of situations

829
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,240
so what do you say and how does that

830
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,720
feel for a person that is

831
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
affected by that it takes you just one

832
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
hour of your time but it will make a

833
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
difference it can actually save your

834
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,880
life so consider doing these

835
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
i will share them on twitter as well my

836
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,399
handle is yellows on the underscore com

837
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,840
so

838
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,320
that concludes our talk we are like

839
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,559
really grateful for

840
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,519
allow

841
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,360
for being allowed to do this again

842
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
because we think this is a very

843
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,720
important topic

844
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,880
and thank you very much for being here

845
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,840
we really appreciate that thank you
