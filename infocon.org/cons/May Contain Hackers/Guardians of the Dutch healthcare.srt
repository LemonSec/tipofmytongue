00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
nails the nerd

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
who will be doing most of the talk

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
because of his colleague dave is kind of

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
an introvert person who doesn't say much

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
but otherwise here's nayla's and he's an

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
enthusiastic nerd who likes to share the

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
things he's working at and he's working

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,559
at a computer emergency response team or

12
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
a cert especially focused on health

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,640
and

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
that was that was incited just before

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
sha 2017 so after five years we're

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000

so uh five years ago i was a shuttle

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
driver at shah

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,280
and then i

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
i met some colleagues

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
future colleagues actually one of which

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
is here in the room today

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
and uh well that escalated into this

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,479
so

31
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
who am i uh

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
i don't really like to talk about myself

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240

most people from the hakka community

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
probably know me as an elliston nerd

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
during my day job i'm a devops engineer

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,360
at z-cert

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
and

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,560
yeah

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,360
today i am

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,159
on mch sadly it's already tear down day

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
so we don't have much left we have dave

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
davis

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
david

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
our shining star of the village

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
and in my free time i'm a member of the

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
hackerspace bitlair in amazfort where i

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
like to make stuff out of cardboard

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
alpacas for instance

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
so yeah i

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
i'm here today to talk about dessert

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
and uh why do you want to talk about

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
t-shirt because uh just like mch we're a

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
non-profit foundation

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,200
and

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,760
i thought it was important that

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
the the community

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
which we have uh

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
have a close connection to

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
it's important to know who we are and

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
what we do

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
so um

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
but i do have a little bit of a warning

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,319
my presentation may contain memes

70
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
in fact

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
it does contain memes

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,120
because

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,760
having fun is a big part of mch so you

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
know i decided to have a little fun with

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
this presentation as well

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,800
so

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
what is desert

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879
some people here might know it other

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,879
people can be like

80
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,760
what is it well it's not butter

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
but it is the dutch healthcare computer

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,840
emergency response team

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,000
and in 2017

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
just before sha 2017 actually

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,159
a group of organizations came together

86
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
from the university hospitals to general

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,760
hospitals mental health care

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
institutions

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
and also the ministry of healthcare

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
because they saw a need

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
for

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
a

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
cyber

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
expertise center in cyber security for

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
healthcare

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
and the reason because is a lot of

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
medical devices these days have an

98
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
internet connection or a network

99
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,000
connection

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
and of course you have the medical

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
device

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,159
the

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,040
the

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,959
electronic patient dossiers

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,760
so

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
cyber security is

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
is very important

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
because if one of those devices gets

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,160
hacked

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
and they can't do their job anymore

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
right lives are at risk people can die

112
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
so zizert was created

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
and we were created as a non-profit

114
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
foundation

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,400
uh which is uh

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,240
very important it's a very important

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
distinction we are

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
also not part of the government we are

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
partly funded by the government but

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
mostly funded by our members

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
and our members are hospitals

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
mental health care institutions uh youth

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,960
healthcare

124
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
and

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
our our founders

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,840
gave us a mission

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
and admission was

128
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
to uh to achieve to strengthen the

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
digital security of the dutch healthcare

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
and

131
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
the way we achieve that is by scanning

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
but also by providing vulnerability

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,280
information

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,240
and to give advice on how to improve

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
information that

136
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
that security the comparison we like to

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,160
make is that we like the digital uh

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
the digital

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
firefighters

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
so firefighters you might see them in

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
the streets

142
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
when they drive around with their big

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
flashy red cars and their big

144
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
blue sirens on top of it

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
but firefighters do much more just like

146
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
zetsart we do a lot more we do also do a

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,479
lot

148
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,199
a lot i think mostly our work in

149
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,039
prevention

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,000
and

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
uh so we talk about how to

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
uh how you

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
not how do you not get

154
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
into a cyber security incident but

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,759
if you do get in a cyber security

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,000
incident of course you can call us

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,840
sadly we don't have a fire truck yet

158
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,240
it's one of my ambitions in life to

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
to sometimes have a fire truck for

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
z-zerot uh it's on the backlog i'm

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
working on it

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
so yeah just like i said we we exist now

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,199
for five years

164
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
and

165
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,039
i was

166
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
i was i was thinking

167
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
six months ago when i submitted this

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
talk i was like yeah i'm going to mch

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
i'm going to do stuff

170
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
there and i want to show off my my the

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
awesome organization i work for

172
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
but the problem is you know

173
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
what i'm going to talk about

174
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
to talk about because there are so many

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
awesome talks here about many technical

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
subjects

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
so i was thinking and i was thinking and

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,599
i submitted the proposal and uh

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
i i had grand ambitions to talk about

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
all these cool tools we created on the

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,880
inside you know scanners and other

182
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
vulnerability stuff

183
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
and then i thought you know what

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,319
there are

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
many more people who are better at this

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
than me

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,120
so what should i talk about

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
and then i

189
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,199
saw some inspiration on twitter

190
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
and it talked about soft skills in cyber

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
security and

192
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
that soft skills are hard skills are

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
nice to have you know it's it's good

194
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
that you're proficient with linux and

195
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
know how to crack the latest windows

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,599
version

197
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
but soft skills are maybe a little bit

198
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,440
more important because that's

199
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
that's what

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,400
that's what gets you

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
in the end of the day

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
so

203
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
then i decided let's throw it around a

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
little bit let's talk about soft skills

205
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,440
and these are the lessons i learned

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,800
in the last five years

207
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
and the first lesson that i learned was

208
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
it's important to know your members so

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
we have

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
hospitals as members but also mental

211
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
health care institutions

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
they are both healthcare but they are

213
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
completely different because in

214
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
hospitals you have

215
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,919
x-ray machines you have mri scanners you

216
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
also have infusion pumps

217
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
that's not so much the case in a mental

218
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
healthcare in hospital

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
you'll have you will have for instance

220
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
security systems

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,600
to monitor patients you will have maybe

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
wristbands to keep track of the patients

223
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
so yeah it's really important to know

224
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
what your customer needs and what your

225
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
customer has

226
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
to provide them with the right

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
information

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
because there is a lot of information

229
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,519
out there and if you just flood them

230
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,040
with information like we did in the

231
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,240
beginning

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
eventually they're like you know

233
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,839
i don't know what to do with this this

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
is too much information

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
so

236
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
we are now working on providing them

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
with the right information by providing

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
for instance information about the

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
systems they have

240
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
i mean most of the people

241
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,000
probably use windows so

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
you can take a guess at that but

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
sometimes there is a little bit more

244
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,920
specialized equipment medical equipment

245
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
for instance

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
and we would we would like to provide

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,599
them with right information for that

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,959
another thing

249
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
is build a community

250
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
and why build a community

251
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
well we might be the expertise center

252
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
for

253
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
cyber security in the healthcare

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
but

255
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
we don't know everything

256
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
and uh that's why it's so great that we

257
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
have 300 members

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
and we have a chat plot platform on

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
which all the members can log in

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
and ask questions to each other

261
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
and we encourage

262
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
our customers to log into that platform

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
as well

264
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
and if we don't know it

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
then they can ask the question there and

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,439
somebody else might know it

267
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
and it's also nice to see the

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,399
discussions for instance about a new

269
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
newly closed disclosed vulnerability

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
in a windows or a medical device

271
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
and see the discussion about hey

272
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
how are you going to tackle this

273
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
what are you going to do first

274
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
stuff like that

275
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
that's uh

276
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,399
and that's a great thing about the

277
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
community because

278
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
we also learn from that we learn from

279
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,839
our community talking about

280
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
stuff and we learn

281
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
what we should do better next time

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
and the last

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
lesson i learned was to connect with

284
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
others

285
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
not only with our members

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
and

287
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
fellow organizations

288
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
uh with healthcare issacs government

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
institutions

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
but also

291
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,640
with communities like these

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
communities like hackers who who send us

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
responsible disclosures about our member

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
institutions

295
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,920
it's important to connect

296
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
because it's uh

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
you guys you you find you find the

298
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
vulnerabilities

299
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
you make healthcare safer

300
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
and that's why it's important to connect

301
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
and that's also the reason i wanted to

302
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
come here

303
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
to

304
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,639
build

305
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,720
this village we made called hack the

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
health

307
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
and uh with hack the health we

308
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
we wanted to come here to show what we

309
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,160
do but also to connect with you guys

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,639
because like i said you are an awesome

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,560
community of individual

312
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
well

313
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
individuals

314
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
and you are passionate about your

315
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
subjects just like we like we are

316
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
passionate about our subject

317
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,040
and uh

318
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
yeah

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,519
that's pretty much it

320
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,760
any questions

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
that was fast

322
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,200
yeah so it went a little bit faster than

323
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,079
i expected you weren't nervous were you

324
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
yes oh excellent

325
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,519
so let's guess come for some more

326
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
questions come please come to the

327
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
microphones in the middle of the room

328
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,320
and we'll look at it nothing

329
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
okay thank you yep

330
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
all right i have two questions

331
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
the first one is i saw you guys posing

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
dave a lot with a lot of signs which

333
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
sign was your favorite for posing him

334
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,240
oh

335
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
uh that's probably this first one

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
uh it's uh it said on him this is what

337
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
happens when you do an unresponsible

338
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
disclosure

339
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
i think that sums it up yeah no

340
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
and the second question i had is you

341
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
mentioned being a devops engineer

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,399
and then you guys are you know a cert

343
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,279
team

344
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
how do those two things kind of work

345
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
together what is the actual day-to-day

346
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,800
of a devops engineer on a cert team

347
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
so uh like i said like i said we have a

348
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
few tools

349
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
hey

350
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
that's nice seeing you again

351
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
uh okay if you have a question i can

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680

353
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
okay so yeah uh they did the stuff about

354
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
of a devops engineer well

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
i always say to people i have the best

356
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
job in the world i might not drive a

357
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,839
tesla but i have the best job in the

358
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,880
world

359
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
um

360
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,680
and

361
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,920
the day-to-day stuff i i basically

362
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,720
run the sys admin team together with my

363
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
colleagues

364
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,360
as a devops engineer i'm mostly

365
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
for the linux part of things so we have

366
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
a few

367
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
homemade tools we have a few

368
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
new tools as well like open cut that we

369
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,320
are

370
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,800
trying to get we are getting running

371
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
right now and uh

372
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
i just make sure that everything keeps

373
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,760
running

374
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
and that

375
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
you know in case the hits the fan

376
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
i'm there

377
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
looking good looking good

378
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
thank you so

379
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
next question

380
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
yes have you ever

381
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,680
had pushbacks for responsible

382
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,360
disclosures from your members

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
yes and how did you deal with that

384
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,720
well

385
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
so uh when we do

386
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
for the responsible disclosures we're

387
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,800
basically the middle the man in the

388
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
middle party so we try to negotiate with

389
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,079
the responsible disclosure uh

390
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
the one who does the responsible

391
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
disclosure and our members sometimes our

392
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
members are very reluctant to do

393
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
something but then we will push them and

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
be like no this is a real vulnerability

395
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,360
you need to stop do stuff

396
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,760
with this

397
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,079
most of the time

398
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,600
we will uh we will get there and uh

399
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,880
some a lot of a lot of swag has been

400
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
sent

401
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,000
so you got

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
quite a few good responses on that

403
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
yeah yeah most uh

404
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
in the beginning

405
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,160
the the

406
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
we don't do this for every member they

407
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,880
have to

408
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,160
specifically sign up for uh at us for uh

409
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
to do it but

410
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
uh eventually when we get it rolling

411
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,040
uh the responses are only positive

412
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
because they see it

413
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,839
the people who do the response of the

414
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,160
disclosure are not bad people they see

415
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,199
like hey

416
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,759
they were they want to make us better

417
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
and i think that's uh that's pretty

418
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,240
great

419
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
it is uh back microphone please

420
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,199
hi there thanks uh for the talk um

421
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
my question is how do you measure

422
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
success do you measure success at all

423
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
because in the beginning of your talk

424
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,920
you said people could die if if things

425
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,959
go wrong that could be a kpi number of

426
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,320
lives saved it might be a bit hard but

427
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
my question is a bit broader so how do

428
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
you measure success and how do you

429
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,759
measure success if you do

430
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
i think the biggest measure of our

431
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,000
success is how

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,959
the

433
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,440
the members think of our services if

434
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
they think

435
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
that our services or

436
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,119
are of value

437
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
um

438
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
i mean we don't have insights on man how

439
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
many lives we have saved or how many

440
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
ransomware incidents we have prevented

441
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,839
there's

442
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,039
a uh

443
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,000
yeah

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
so i think that that's that's the

445
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
biggest measurement of our success of

446
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,240
course we have some some hard

447
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
kpi metrics that i

448
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
don't know on the top of my head

449
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
but yeah

450
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
all right thank you

451
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
if you don't if you don't know them from

452
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
the top of your head they're probably

453
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,720
not that

454
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,559
relied on the kpi so i think that's good

455
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,440
think

456
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
about the results yeah

457
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
keeping our members happy and safe that

458
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,919
exactly that's the most important thing

459
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,200
we do

460
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
the front mic please

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,919
thank you

462
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,080
uh thank you for the talk at first it

463
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
was a very interesting

464
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,840
since there's some time left i was just

465
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,799
wondering could you go to more details

466
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
maybe about a example case or maybe

467
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
something about the internal tools you

468
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
were teasing all the time oh or yeah

469
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,919
like

470
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,840
so

471
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,160
um a few of the internal tools uh

472
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
so we are a non-profit foundation

473
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
so uh money is uh

474
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,679
we don't have a very big

475
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,120
pool of money

476
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
so we prefer to use open source tools

477
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
and one of the tools we

478
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,280
use a lot is the hive

479
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,480
with together with cortex

480
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
but we also are exploring some new

481
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
options

482
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,160
for instance we're looking at software

483
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
and

484
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
we also of course we are nerds we like

485
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
to do technical stuff so we have a lot

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,880
of

487
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,000
scripts we use here and there um a lot

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
of bash scripts actually python also

489
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
really nice

490
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
so yeah that's uh that's

491
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
most of the stuff we use

492
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
thank you the back microphone please

493
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
uh yeah question from the internet from

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
vision

495
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
yeah you already briefly touched on this

496
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
but perhaps uh yeah i'd like for some

497
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
more depth to it how did you get

498
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
involved at csert

499
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,120
yeah so yeah like i said at the

500
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000

met him there and i was talking to him

510
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440

to

517
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
research how to use the hive

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
for phishing email research

519
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
and uh well it was a pretty successful

520
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
graduation uh internship

521
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,559
i uh barely passed but uh

522
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,080
that was not because of the tool that

523
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,799
was because i'm a very bad writer

524
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,799
uh i'm a better talker

525
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,360
apparently um so yeah i i passed i

526
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
did my presentation on a friday they

527
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
said i passed

528
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,679
and then cesar said to me you know we

529
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
really like your nails and so do you

530
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,679
like us i said yes

531
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,280
so i graduated on a friday and it

532
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,799
started on a monday

533
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,360
uh working there so yeah

534
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,559
and uh

535
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,400
i think that's also uh

536
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
that's that's one of the lessons i try

537
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
to incorporate at the end so

538
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
this community and these angel shifts

539
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
they are not just like for helping out

540
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
the people they could also provide

541
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,280
something for you

542
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
maybe your next job maybe a next

543
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
opportunity for something else

544
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
so yeah that is the

545
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,960
best

546
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
disclosures you you get

to use or abuse them for secret service

560
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
purposes uh

561
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640

562
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,280
customers

563
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,240

situation uh and i

570
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280

571
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240

being developed by inisa i believe i'm

590
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,120
looking at jasper what was the course

591
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,640
called again

592
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
transits transits one and transits two

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
question i

617
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,520
i can't answer that

618

619
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,919
if you want to know that information we

620
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,360
have john from the biohacking village

621
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,120
who has a very strong opinion about that

622
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,039
so uh oh that's one of the

623
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
one of the people i've got to thank

624
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
we're here with hack the health and we

625
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,279
also got a lot of help from john from

626
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
the biohacking village

627
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
um

628
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
it was quite awesome

629
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
uh we were we were planning to organize

630
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
this we put it on the wiki and i also

631
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,159
got an email from john saying hey

632
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,520
you're doing this want some help

633
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
yeah

634
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,400
i just mentioned that you don't know how

635
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
much you prevented

636
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,679
but are you so to say um still at the

637
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,520
front do you see the attacks and if so

638
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,159
um do you notice where they come from is

639
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
there increased decrease over the last

640
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,559
few months you know

641
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,360
anything insightful on that

642
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,520
um

643
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,039
i'm not sure about if there is an

644
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,120
increase or decrease we

645
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,919
we

646
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
we see a

647
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
certain uh

648
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
a stable flow

649
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,279
of attacks

650
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,919
so the biggest threat for healthcare is

651
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,919
not

652
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,919
government-sponsored attacks

653
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
the biggest threat is actually

654
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
ransomware

655
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,440
government-sponsored attacks are mostly

656
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,679
there to gather information not to break

657
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,200
things ransomware is there to break

658
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,080
things

659
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,679
and that will

660
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,279
that will interrupt the day-to-day

661
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,640
operation of the of the hospital so

662
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
that's that's one of the biggest things

663
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,120
we

664
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
we are watching out for

665
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,919
fortunately we do not

666
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
have a big ransomware incident yet this

667
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,439
is not an infight by the way

668
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,840
so yeah luckily

669
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
we have not seen that yet

670
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,760
and indeed that is not a challenge no

671
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
challenge not accepted please

672
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
nils

673
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
thank you so much for this wonderful

674
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
talk on the situation ladies and

675
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
gentlemen

676
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,120
thank you
