2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
well this talk has climate elements in

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
it so there's going to be some gloom and

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
doom but there will be a glittery shiny

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,240
thing in the end as well a few

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,359
um

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,000
most climate talks tell you how terrible

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
situations is during this 50 minute talk

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
five species around the world are going

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
extinct i think that's terrible

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
um and the the links are there you can

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
follow those there's generally links

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,120
footnotes and there's more references in

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
the in the download

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
if i think about

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
species going extinct i think witches

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,840
which are the ones that we depend on

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
because we do depend on each other in

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
this earth as humans as well as animals

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
i don't believe politicians are going to

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,719
show this and having heard a few climate

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
talks during this

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
this series of lectures i don't think

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
anyone else agrees that they would have

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
vision knowledge or spine needed to do

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,159
this

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
consumers seem to be waiting for a drop

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,640
in instant replacement that solves all

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
their problems in one buy because that's

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
simple and easy and no overlap and cheap

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,479
and

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,200
and

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
maybe making things worse technology is

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
always promising yeah this is nice this

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,280
could solve it but see this is going to

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
be the cheaper one we'll have it in 10

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,600
years but we are here now we need it now

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
and i'm really worried about how these

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
things working

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
um usually when species go extinct

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,200
including humans by the way it's due to

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
resource shortage

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
and something in the habitat changes

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
some

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
food form falls falls away and they die

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,920
they perish

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
by the way if this happens to human

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
societies then usually the response is

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
that humans cannibalize on their leaders

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
who have failed

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
we can't stress that often enough

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
towards our politicians i think um but

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
um

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
jared diamond has done a lot of research

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
on how

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
societies collapse

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
and

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
the link is a very good uh short video i

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
really recommend it he compares it like

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
to a bacteria in a petri dish i mean

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
it's full of food it's munching munching

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
munching and all of a sudden it hits the

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
rim and of course it looks one molecule

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
ahead so

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
only when it hits the rim it realize i

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
now need to die because there's no food

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
for me left anymore

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
and that happens to the entire culture

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
at once while they were munching

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
munching monkey they never saw it but

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
the inevitable problem was coming i was

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
hitting them

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
and

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
in humans the same seems to be happening

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
uh also according to the recess but here

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,879
at diamond and it is not because people

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
are stupid it's because they make local

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
and individual choices

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,800
i understand the problem but i really

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
need this

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
now

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
and

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
sometimes you make excuses sometimes

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
really true for survival for example but

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
taking back to politics if we look at

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
the number of humans and uh

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
multiplied by the average resource

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,400
dependency of a human we are using 1.75

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
earth

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
there is uh

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
you can compute back

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,879
if you take the resources for a full

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
year and start on january 1st what's the

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
day at which

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
resource has been used in this case it's

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
next thursday

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
so we're halfway the year roughly and

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
we've used up all the resources that we

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
have available for this year how can

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
this be sustainable are we not going to

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
consume anymore for the rest of the year

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
i don't think so

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,879
so we should be clever about this

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
mahatma gandhi said it better than i can

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
i would say be part of solution of the

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
problem but i also very much love be the

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
change you wish to see in the world well

108
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
there might be few people here that

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
agree

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,280
um

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,599
hack your way into so what i tend to do

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,040
is hack my way into physics even

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
biochemistry i didn't have much

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
chemistry at school

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
energy but also the microbes are part of

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
that i mean they sort of go together

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,879
with biochemistry and they have their

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
own classification of resources

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
and what i always try to do is not

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,160
depend on global solutions the big ones

121
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
the big schemes because they tend to be

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
corporal and have completely different

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
interests so i try to make local

124
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
find local solutions and gain control

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
personal control if possible

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
so with that let's talk a bit more about

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,800
microbes anyone here brewed beer

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
yeah

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
beer yeah

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,119
not drinking brewing

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
anyone here um

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
um made sauerkraut

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
kimchi yeah that's sauerkraut with

134
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,919
additional red peppers but it's

135
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
basically the same recipe sauerkraut is

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
normally made with white cabbage but you

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
can pretty much use any vegetable and

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
just put it in the salt water and it'll

139
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
ferment

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,400
i'll explain why later um

141
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,680
[Music]

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,320
vinegar is usually something that went

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
wrong with your wine and i'll explain

144
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
how that forms too

145
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,240
but let's go for four four

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
candidates amylase actually is not a

147
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
microbe it's uh it's an enzyme so it

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,120
takes a module and puts it together in

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
another way or splits it or something

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
and what amylase does it takes starch so

151
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
a chain of glucose molecules

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
adds water and then forms glucose a lot

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,919
of different glucose molecules and

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
glucose is the food for all of life

155
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,199
so

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
that's why it stores in long chains

157
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
because then it's not accessible to the

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,039
others and only to those who have

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
amilasa where do you find it well in our

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
in our saliva for example in our small

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
intestines we produce it so that we can

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
do that too

163
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
um plants also need it so it's usually

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
like if you have the seed for which you

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
brew the beer you usually um

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
it also needs to take down its own

167
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
starches so

168
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
it actually uh has amilasa on board

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
which is activated when there's water so

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
that the glucose gets is made available

171
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
so usually what you do with brewing beer

172
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
is you start growing the seeds a little

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,720
until the maximum amount of sugar is

174
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
available you can see that at length and

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,479
then you cut short life of the seed

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
enamel assay can also be produced by

177
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
microbes and by chemical plants and

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
there's plenty of places to get it from

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
yeast

180
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
is a microbe it's a single cell thing

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
and it takes a sugar

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
and turns to co2 and alcohol

183
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
so these are the bubbles and these are

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
the buzz in your beer

185
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
so we got that already and there's hop

186
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
for maintainability or other things

187
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
now um if you produce a beer you usually

188
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,479
take a yeast and you inoculate the beer

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,080
with so much yeast

190
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
that no other species basically has a

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
chance and that's usually how it works

192
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
if something is really persistent really

193
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,199
everywhere it's going to take over

194
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,199
everything a bit like humans are doing

195
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
with earth perhaps

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
but if you make a lumpy beer you do it

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
completely differently you do not

198
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
inoculate it with an explicit species

199
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
which you could say is a very technical

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
approach a very controlled approach

201
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
lambic is more the natural way of saying

202
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
just we take shallow pan we put our

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
sugar water basically you take these

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
seeds you boil them out so the sugar

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
comes out you sift out

206
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
the seeds and you have sugary water they

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
put that in a hollow pan

208
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
open the windows overnight and the wind

209
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
gusts over it go over it and then you

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,280
get yeast from nature which can be

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
varieties it's in the air everywhere

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
anyway

213
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
but you may also get lactobacillin

214
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,599
acetobacter and these are different

215
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,319
breeds lactobacilli transforms lactose

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
but also leave all the sugars into

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
lactic acid this is what makes yogurt

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
sour

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
and

220
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
acidobacter are slightly different they

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
take an alcohol

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
and they turn it into acetic acid acid

223
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
and acetic acid is

224
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
what makes vinegar acidic

225
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
and we will see this come back actually

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,080
because we also produce something called

227
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
acetate

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,199
and we actually use it for energy

229
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
um but basically the process for beers

230
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
than amilas and yeast and if it's

231
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,599
lambique

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
one or two of these might also help to

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
get a more acidic beer and that's indeed

234
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
what a lambique is

235
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
um

236
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
and of course if as a tobacco land up in

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
your wine it is also going to turn to

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,159
vinegar we also know that effect so keep

239
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
your fruit flies away because they carry

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
them on their little paws

241
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
because they go from rotting fruit to

242
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
rotting fruit to rotting fruit

243
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
um in general microbes form

244
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
collaborative communities they have

245
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
resources that they pass from one to the

246
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
other and basically they're munching

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
away at each other's

248
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,440
excrements

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
but even a single cell like yeast is

250
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,040
extremely com extremely clever

251
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,399
it takes gluco it takes sugar apart and

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,640
puts it out in two ways but different

253
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
sugars need different enzymes to take

254
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
apart i mean it's just a different of

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
machine that needs done now these

256
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,440
enzymes are produced by transcribing

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
bits of dna

258
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,880
and what you can do and that's called

259
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
epigenetics it also works for humans is

260
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,480
put a clamp

261
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
on the part that would otherwise get

262
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
transcribed and by that you can

263
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,040
basically control switch on or off

264
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
a transition and it uses that because

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,240
glucose offers it more energy so when

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,640
this glucose it will gladly turn that

267
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
into co2 and alcohol but when there's

268
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
another sugar which is

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
when there are only other sugars it will

270
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
use those because it will help it

271
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
survive even though it's at a lower

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
energy state

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
so what what it does to to achieve that

274
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,519
is that i mean to avoid spending

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,360
resources for those other enzymes every

276
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,519
time is it puts this clamp on it

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,120
whenever there's glucose available when

278
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
the glucose drops it goes away so yeast

279
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,240
can actually be hungry

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
and start nibbling on wood or something

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
why does it do this because it gives the

282
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
best chance of survival

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
eat the most energetic food when

284
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
available if not do what we need for

285
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
survival

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
and that's another aspect of microbes

287
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
they compete

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
if they want the same resource they are

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
going to compete for it

290
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,279
um

291
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
and an example would be the alcohol that

292
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
should i

293
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
oh sorry the lactose

294
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
that could be taken up by the yeast or

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,560
by the lactobacilli so lumpy generally

296
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
has both alcohol and acidity because

297
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
both communities evolve if you were to

298
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,720
splash in an incredible amount of

299
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
lactobacilli i don't think there will be

300
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
much alcohol you would definitely

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
influence ratios

302
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
so this is sort of how this muggy brew

303
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
comes together by a combination of um of

304
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
microbes and i think it's really is

305
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,519
exciting especially comparing technology

306
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,839
to nature i think is really interesting

307
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
i love technology i mean it's simple

308
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
it's clean it's abstract it's kind of

309
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
this beautiful mathematical underpinning

310
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
very often

311
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
but maybe a downside it is a single

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
solution thingy and everything we do

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,839
must be enforced by energy

314
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,360
whereas in nature everything is complex

315
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
and just take all the possible solutions

316
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
you ever found and throw it at there i

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,320
mean everywhere around us are microbes

318
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
but what survives on this pool is

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
different because well i just touched it

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
it's a bit fatty now so quite likely

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,040
that fat specialized microbes are going

322
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,839
to form a film on there whereas in your

323
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
nostril there's another specification

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
specialization than in your ears and on

325
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,399
your skin and they're everywhere and

326
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
they're useful and we want them around

327
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
hygiene

328
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
sorry sterility is a stupid way of

329
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
achieving hygiene

330
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
washing your hands with soap is good

331
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
enough antibacterial soap is stupid

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,839
because you are killing all the species

333
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,600
probably giving way to the strongest one

334
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
to survive we're creating a new well

335
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
i'll get to that um but the interesting

336
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
thing is that because of this throwing

337
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
every solution and every problem

338
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
it's nature always comes with

339
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
all-purpose solutions and whatever

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
happens is voluntary because there's

341
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
energy to be had so those microbes

342
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
really like to work on there and when

343
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
they're successful they will they will

344
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,680
grow and get more more dominant

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,279
now i'm not saying technology in nature

346
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,360
are opponents i think they are best when

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
they're brought together

348
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
and that's why i'm giving this talk um

349
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
permaculture is an area of expertise

350
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,880
that tends to do this with plants and

351
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
technology attack solar cells and

352
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
heating your your greenhouse and that

353
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,959
sort of thing um

354
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,720
i'm taking a bit of a special angle by

355
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
saying well let's see what we can do

356
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,680
with microbes

357
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
that's a bit of an experiment i might go

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
mad but or you might call me mad it's

359
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
not quite the same thing

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
so when i was born i got a symbiote

361
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
implanted

362
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
that's pretty unique nobody else has the

363
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
symbiote but it's really helping me it's

364
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
doing this epigenetic thing for me that

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
means i have less risk of cancer of

366
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
heart disease and diabetes

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
it trains and it calms my immune system

368
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
i've been very happy about that last few

369
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
years

370
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
and um

371
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
i think that's generally very pleasant

372
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
to have

373
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
but it is a symbiote

374
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,760
if i

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
don't care for it properly it will hit

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
back on me

377
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
you probably guessed what i'm talking

378
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
about i mean this is a picture of one

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
such symbiote

380
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
this will be the symbiote

381
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
all these little critters and creatures

382
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
here all the bacteria and viruses and

383
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
whatever else you have

384
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
this is a slime layer and these are body

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
cells and these are the internal these

386
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
are the cells of the

387
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
the wall lining of your large intestine

388
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
so this one

389
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
the one that's filled with the dirtiest

390
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,440
thing you can think of that your mother

391
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
always said is dirty but it's actually

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
extremely useful it does a lot it counts

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
10 these microbes together have 10 times

394
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
the number of cells that your body has

395
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
that dna is

396
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,000
and fifty fold of what we have imagine

397
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,720
what food you can mention with that

398
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
and it's giving that away sometimes to

399
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
other microbes sometimes to us

400
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
and that's where i mentioned acetate one

401
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,519
of the things they produce is acetate

402
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
butyrate and propionate also the

403
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,240
so-called short-chain fatty acids and

404
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,959
they do marvels for us they are burned

405
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,920
as energy first and foremost to make our

406
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
lining produce more slime and be more

407
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
resilient to

408
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,920
to to all sorts of things close off

409
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,959
better

410
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
they do lots of things but also they get

411
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
in the bloodstream they tell the trigger

412
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
to to do different things

413
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
um and they they they will even improve

414
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,519
your fat burning for example bitrate

415
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
improve your fat burning that's why

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
people who eat oats are usually very

417
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
slim but because oats tends to produce a

418
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
lot of butyrate

419
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
and that basically signals to the the

420
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
epigenetic

421
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
game is started to

422
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
trigger the the

423
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
the body towards

424
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
digesting uh

425
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,199
fat instead of other things

426
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,079
um

427
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
the condition is that i need to feed it

428
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,480
real food i can get into definition but

429
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
you know real food proper food whole

430
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,360
food

431
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,199
pretty much know what i mean i'm not

432
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
talking about mcdonald's here

433
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
so

434
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
i was really surprised to find

435
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,360
that statistical clustering research

436
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
found that there are two clusters of

437
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
these things i compare them to mafia

438
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
families headed by the one boss is

439
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
called betroids and the other bosses

440
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
called prevotella i don't care about the

441
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
names but they have vastly different

442
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,959
properties

443
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,720
one of them

444
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
feasts on cholesterol saturated fats so

445
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,240
in other words meat fish dairy and egg

446
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
and as we know these are pretty

447
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,279
detrimental for our health especially in

448
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,519
the long term

449
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
um whereas prevotella is onto fiber and

450
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,959
phytophenols

451
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,199
as you can see from this it's from

452
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,320
plants

453
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
so basically vegetables fruits grains

454
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
and pulses and that's constructed for

455
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,959
our health there is an incredible body

456
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,839
of

457
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,160
nutrition research

458
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,360
that

459
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
so consequently says that this style of

460
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,880
food

461
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
gives people prosperity um

462
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,399
health

463
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,279
longevity 14 years extra to their lives

464
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,000
and in those lives more sorry in those

465
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
years more life so more years in your

466
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,000
life for more life in your years good

467
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
deal

468
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
whereas this

469
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
happens to make us a little

470
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
and die

471
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,199
um

472
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,000
i think and but now i'm interpreting i

473
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
think first of all this is part of a

474
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,240
large chain of of course this is just

475
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,759
one instrument but i think um

476
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
this is mostly the time-tested dna code

477
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
we've been debugging this system for

478
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,839
ages many people have died out because

479
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,640
they ate badly or had the gene sorry had

480
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
the genes that didn't adapt to the way

481
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
they had to eat namely vegetable based

482
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
the farmers and such

483
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
whereas this is more for

484
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
occasional partying and if we screw up

485
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
something in our body the body will heal

486
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
so there's no natural selection on that

487
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,280
i mean the body incredibly good at

488
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,199
healing especially if you switch back to

489
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,319
that later

490
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
doing this three times a day might hit

491
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
upon a few untested code lines on your

492
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
dna and that's

493
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
i i think

494
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,720
the diabetes and the heart disease and

495
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
the cancer which are greatly on the rise

496
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
they are very much linked to this style

497
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
of living and the interesting thing is

498
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
you are not stuck with the microbes that

499
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
you're born with because when you feed

500
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
them differently their proportions

501
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
change just like i explained for

502
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
inoculating your your beer differently

503
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
this changes all the time because

504
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
imagine every day

505
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
it goes through and the new food arrives

506
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
and it has a new time new new chance to

507
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,919
feast and to feed and find find another

508
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,919
balance so this very quickly changes in

509
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,840
a matter of days

510
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
interestingly they also influ influence

511
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
your taste

512
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
so in three weeks you're actually

513
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,679
adapted to whatever you choose

514
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
that's an interesting fact that most

515
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
people don't know

516
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,720
um

517
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
there's something else that these

518
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
bacteria would do if we would not be

519
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
digesting the small chain fatty acids

520
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
that amend the acetate to butyrate and

521
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
propionate

522
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
because um they might be turned to

523
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
methane otherwise and you probably know

524
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
the experiment with lucifer and farting

525
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
over it and

526
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,080
getting a flame cows are much better

527
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,760
than we are they can burn down entire

528
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
farms actually

529
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
um methane is produced by something

530
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
called the methanobacter it's ancient

531
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
it's

532
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,919
from volcanic ages when we had a methane

533
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,400
atmospheres really really old it's also

534
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,840
incredibly sensitive

535
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
getting too cold getting under 40-ish

536
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,039
degrees under

537
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
35-ish degrees it will die

538
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
giving it uh oxygen it will die i mean

539
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,960
it's

540
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
it came to be in another kind of

541
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,840
atmosphere and it grows very slowly and

542
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,880
yet it has survived until now i'm amazed

543
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
by that it can basically only survive in

544
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,320
swamps but have one swamp eat have one

545
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
duck eating one swab

546
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
go to another and deposit something

547
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
there probably that's the way it passes

548
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
over because it can all survive in the

549
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,960
gut

550
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
that's why the experiment works

551
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,840
and what it does basically is it takes

552
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,799
acetate remember acetic acid um so that

553
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,360
will be with the age attached but take

554
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,799
acetate

555
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,200
and a hydrogen atom that's been donated

556
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,440
by a bacteria that wants to get rid of

557
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
them they do exist

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,919
and then 23 h4 and co2 what and co2

559
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,840
we haven't burned it yet and we have co2

560
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
already that's a bit early

561
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
so what i'm now saying is that when you

562
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
use this process to produce biogas

563
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,919
because that's what i'm talking about

564
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,640
you are actually producing co2

565
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,559
before you have

566
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
your biogas

567
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
that's a bit stupid isn't it because

568
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,240
when you're doubling the amount of co2

569
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
in this way of course it's quite fine if

570
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,360
that co2 is is an annual cycle

571
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
but burning trees for example is a very

572
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
bad idea because we had a co2 problem

573
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
before we started digesting trees

574
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
my hometown of french i'm proud to say

575
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
is cutting trees like mad

576
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
and they're doing the biodigestion but

577
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
they're still green because they do it

578
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
in the waste department where nobody's

579
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,679
looking where the co2 goes i mean waste

580
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
everything comes out of there can be

581
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,480
anything this is really damaging this is

582
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
politics having having a single agenda

583
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,200
just the co2 and then saying oh we want

584
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
to get away from gas and then saying

585
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
let's ignore that and let's ignore

586
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
global heating and let's just

587
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
do whatever

588
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
fits a very small

589
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,720
scope it's terrible

590
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
um before you can make

591
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
the methanol back to work you need to do

592
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
some preparation you need to get to this

593
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
acetate

594
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,400
um and that's called s2 genesis before

595
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,480
that comes acidogens these are the four

596
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
stages that

597
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,520
um are done in a in a bioreactor

598
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
in a biodigestion system to to form

599
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
methane

600
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,080
and

601
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
well they do all sorts of cut down but

602
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
these are basically the three these are

603
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
just the formula of the three the

604
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
acetate the butyrate and the

605
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,159
the propionate the short-chain fatty

606
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
acids as well as alcohols a hydrolyzed

607
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
issue is what i said what amylase also

608
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,320
does it cuts up chains of glucose and or

609
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760
changed like proteins or fats and breaks

610
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,559
them into small bundles so it goes from

611
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,679
here to here to here to methanobacter

612
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,360
methanogenesis

613
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,840
um the problem is in this stage

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,400
because there are side products and one

615
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
of them is ammonia nh3 um it's a poison

616
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,720
to us basically um it's very aggressive

617
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
i mean look at all those age ages

618
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,280
jumping to get off but it can also lead

619
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
to over fertilization

620
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
because what you do to process this

621
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,440
stuff is you turn it into nitrous oxide

622
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
so no2 no3

623
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
and

624
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,520
we have a lot of that already in the

625
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,919
ground which is why when it's hot

626
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,080
weeds are starting to grow like mad and

627
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
then die off take out all the oxygen and

628
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
we have botulism and we have blue algae

629
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
problems that's because of over

630
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,960
fertilization

631
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,919
somewhat more positive stored hydrogen

632
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,720
sulfide which is a poison again but it

633
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
can be easily turned to gypsum by adding

634
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
water water damp to it hydrogen of

635
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
course can be explosive but if you are

636
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
able to split these streams up you can

637
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,799
basically do this but these are all the

638
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,760
extra extras you get when you make uh

639
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
biogas

640
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
and usually it's burnt along with them

641
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,320
and i'm not sure that's a good idea

642
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,679
because that means the

643
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,919
nitrogen gets into the air as nitrous

644
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,440
oxide

645
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
that's

646
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,559
exactly the opposite of what we should

647
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,039
be doing also this introduces a lot of

648
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,480
handling overhead and that means you

649
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,240
need to do this on a large scale and

650
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,760
when you do that you get the same

651
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,039
anonymity

652
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,320
as you have in the sewer this can

653
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
actually be used in a sewer treated

654
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,039
plant

655
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,520
flush it away it's gone no it's not the

656
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
travel just starts the journey just

657
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
starts

658
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,559
um and there have been examples of

659
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,400
farmers doing this as an extra thing to

660
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
get rid of their green waste for example

661
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
but

662
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
these bacteria must be fed because

663
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
otherwise they staff

664
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
so things like impregnated fence food

665
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
might for example end up in there the

666
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,919
result is that the output is not

667
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,200
completely

668
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,039
natural anymore but you get heavy metals

669
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
added all of a sudden the end product is

670
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
waste it's almost nuclear waste you have

671
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
to be really careful with it

672
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,159
same story if you feed it with waste

673
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,919
from animal farms

674
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,799
i'm not a fan of animal farms by the way

675
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,200
um i'm the only one here i'm sure

676
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,919
um i'm not a fan of animal farms the way

677
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
we do it the strictly economic

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
optimization is a bad idea um because

679
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,840
there's toxins in there there's

680
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
medicines in there copper that sort of

681
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,159
thing you don't want that

682
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,919
so and on a small scale you can't do

683
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,520
this because of the overhead and also

684
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,360
because you need to actively heat the

685
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
biodigestion system

686
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
um the methanol vector produce the

687
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,880
biogas as as their energy as the energy

688
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
source and that means you actually need

689
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
to provide the heat for them

690
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
um to stay alive and this would not be a

691
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
problem if you wouldn't have to flush

692
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
through waste all the time so you're

693
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
heating up all that waste so that it can

694
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
do its work

695
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
it's a

696
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
wonderful story

697
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,200
so i've dealt all that

698
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
with all that and this would also happen

699
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
in us if it wasn't that we took up these

700
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
short chain fatty acids

701
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
um

702
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
or you can of course eat

703
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
milk chicken mcnuggets all the time and

704
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
you probably wouldn't be you wouldn't

705
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
have any fiber so you wouldn't be

706
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,240
producing any shortchain fatty acids

707
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
microbial

708
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
fuel cells however are another thing

709
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
that is are very close to this

710
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
and basically what you do then is you

711
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,279
say well there are these microbes that

712
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,400
produce

713
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,679
hydrogen

714
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,960
what if i

715
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
create a condition

716
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,080
created conditions where i no sorry

717
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
i really need to cut short apparently

718
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
sorry

719
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,000
microbial fuel cells are like fuel cells

720
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
except you have a

721
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,320
cathode and anode that are permissible

722
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,480
for microbes and they live on there

723
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,279
and they would pass in the hydrogen that

724
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,960
would be very interesting to do that

725
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,279
with sludge but in practice research has

726
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,000
been done this is not really efficient

727
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,559
if only we had better fuel cells

728
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
there may be an option for other

729
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
hydrogen

730
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
carriers and even materials as clay and

731
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,480
carbon can be used for that

732
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,440
and

733
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
this has actually been shown to work

734
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
with urine

735
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,799
plain dull urine

736
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,799
the researchers doing much of that

737
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
develop this actually this one runs a

738
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,799
waste but it's the same mechanism these

739
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,760
are all microbial fuel cells very small

740
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
ones you build them from clay as a

741
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,080
membrane you have two membranes of

742
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,559
carbon and basically you fill them with

743
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,039
sludge uh from the sewer because that's

744
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,840
microbially microbially rich and you

745
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,640
train them for a while with with pee

746
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
it sounded to me like they had students

747
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
coming up with voluntarily peeing and

748
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
then

749
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,039
but

750
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,320
um

751
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
urea

752
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
is

753
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,760
two percent of urine because urine

754
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,480
itself is not is mostly water if you get

755
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
rid of that then the majority of what's

756
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,799
left is called urea that's this formula

757
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,640
and it carries a lot of it carries

758
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,559
hydrogen not specifically much but it

759
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,880
very easily lets go of it

760
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
and there are many things in nature that

761
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
carry electrons and get rid of them but

762
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
they're usually aggressive and this one

763
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,039
isn't it's used in skin lotion for

764
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,360
example and it's very stable when dry

765
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,279
it's used as a nitrogen fertilizer and

766
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,320
just stored in bulk in farmer sheds now

767
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,520
that's fine as long as it's dry

768
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
um

769
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
you can read up how we get to it but

770
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,679
it's basically a breakdown now what i

771
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,360
found really interesting is doing some

772
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,000
math on the density energy density of

773
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
the different materials both per

774
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
kilogram

775
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
if you have to carry it all the time

776
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
or per liter if you have to store it

777
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,159
somewhere in your home and then methane

778
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
and hydrogen are actually quite low per

779
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,840
liter but of course hydrogen is per

780
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
kilogram has a lot because

781
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
it's big

782
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
but what i found very striking is that

783
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,080
even plain urine

784
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,039
is better than a lithium-ion battery

785
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,520
both per kilogram per liter

786
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,039
i have to say

787
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
that urine is known for a lot of energy

788
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
but many people don't know it i have to

789
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,480
say this is a theoretic uh equation this

790
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
is theoretically derived from the

791
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,840
chemistry whereas this is what batteries

792
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
do in practice so there is a technical

793
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
percentage here involved but i think

794
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,799
this this holds a very great promise

795
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,799
and especially if we

796
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,799
get rid of the water in some we have

797
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,640
lots of heat in our

798
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
solar boilers anyway we can't get rid of

799
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,760
it

800
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
vaporize off the the water and then

801
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
basically have 50 because it's two

802
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,399
percent

803
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,720
you have a 50 times more potent material

804
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,039
both per liter and per kilogram

805
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,240
and

806
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,080
one percent is already very interesting

807
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,039
there

808
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,600
so um what what does that mean we

809
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,080
produce about 30 grams of urea a day i

810
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
suppose it differs whether you eat much

811
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
meat or less or beans or but basically

812
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
because it's a protein breakdown product

813
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
but the liver

814
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,279
when you break down protein you

815
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
basically produce

816
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,399
methane and that's a poison it's in a

817
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,840
bloodstream and the liver immediately

818
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
takes it out and at the expense of

819
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
energy turns into urea it really wants

820
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,039
to get rid of it so by the time we pee

821
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,679
it out it has quite a bit of energy

822
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,279
and this is the factor i gave you this

823
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,520
is the amount we pee out so that's 160

824
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
watt hours per day

825
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
or 9.7 volts continuously more than my

826
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,960
laptop does and half of my tv does well

827
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
i don't have to run my tv full time so

828
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,919
who cares

829
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,320
um challenge anyone interested in

830
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,279
building the first raspberry p

831
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,520
i'm not going to but

832
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,039
this is sort of the sort of thing we can

833
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,200
do right run the server on p

834
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,480
why not

835
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,960
go for it

836
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
so um

837
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
if you allow urea to get watery as it is

838
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,799
in p

839
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,279
p is uh when you don't have a infection

840
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,799
bladder infection it is basically

841
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,720
sterile but leave it to the air and

842
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,360
microbes will get in discover the energy

843
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,919
and make ammonia and we all know how how

844
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,000
wonderfully that smells and then further

845
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,039
to turn it down to a fertilizer if we

846
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,279
avoid that process instead use

847
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
electrolysis

848
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,440
electrolysis with nickel

849
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
ish

850
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,600
electrodes so pretty cheap compared to

851
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,480
platinum for plain hydrogen winning you

852
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,360
need

853
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
37 thank you

854
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
you need

855
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,320
0.37 false to use instead of 1.23 volts

856
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,640
around your plates meaning a third of a

857
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
voltage or a third of the energy to get

858
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
to the hydrogen

859
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,399
i've heard about blue and black and

860
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,360
green

861
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
hydrogen i haven't heard about yellow

862
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,919
yet but i think it's about time we get

863
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,159
started with that

864
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
um i have solar cells i'm sure i'm

865
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
interested

866
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,080
and haven't done all of this yet

867
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
good oh sorry um or you could use a

868
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,360
direct urea fuel cell which basically is

869
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
a fuel cell that you put urea in or the

870
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
microbial version that i just talked

871
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,159
about which you basically invest with

872
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
sewer water and then train with urine

873
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,760
urine urine

874
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
um and that can be done with clean

875
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,200
carbon this there's a lot of research

876
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,519
being done here um

877
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,960
in the interest of

878
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,880
non-industrial uh poor countries um

879
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,559
unfortunately the researchers claim a

880
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,240
lot of patents make makes me think of

881
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
rsa i don't think we want to do that

882
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,760
again so

883
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
go ahead go and play with it try the

884
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,519
recipes are basically in the research

885
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,600
papers play with it and see if you can

886
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,559
you could do it too and score by uh

887
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,039
publishing patent avoidance of patent

888
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,679
prevention things

889
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,519
now

890
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,399
i my home and the thousand around me and

891
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,760
my my my

892
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,440
hometown

893
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
are connected to a heating system a

894
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,559
central heating system for the entire

895
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,279
thousand homes it's incredibly efficient

896
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,600
inefficient it's more than 50 years old

897
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,919
it predates the club of rome

898
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,799
and we are forced to use it

899
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,640
so i said i don't like it i don't want

900
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
it because it's all fossil i want to get

901
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,240
rid of it and also because of the the

902
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,640
waste treatment of biogas

903
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
green washing because i want to i want

904
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
to get out of it they said you can't we

905
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,240
can't disconnect you so i said well my

906
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
neighboring plumber says i can he can do

907
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
it so

908
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,840
it can be done so it's technically not a

909
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,000
problem it's just because there's lack

910
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,120
of will on your side and then i just

911
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
looked up the legal uh the legal

912
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,519
situation and they've made so many

913
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,679
mistakes in legal terms they've broken

914
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,679
so many consumer laws and so many

915
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,519
heating there's a special volume to that

916
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
especially heating northern netherlands

917
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,600
we've broken so much of it that i just

918
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
said well you've done that wrong um we

919
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
could go to court but you know i could

920
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
just destroy the contact because you've

921
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
done withdrawal withdrawal and misdraft

922
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,000
from standard which are reasons to

923
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,679
destroy contract meaning the contract

924
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
never existed so i am now

925
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,640
um not connected to that and more used

926
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
infrared panels fed with my solar panels

927
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
covered by 90 by the solar solar panels

928
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,120
but i'm very interested now in

929
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,600
opportunistic ways of avoiding using

930
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
this infrared and because of that i've

931
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,279
looked at compost for heating people

932
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,600
have done this people have just built a

933
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,519
compost pile inside there

934
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,039
they built a structure put a compost

935
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,799
pile in

936
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
and they basically used it for heat you

937
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
need to be aware that it needs to have

938
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,760
oxygen it needs to get out it's co2 so

939
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
you need to be careful a little but

940
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,279
there are a few very good

941
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,039
very simple reasons for making this go

942
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,200
stable because compost is extremely

943
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,559
stable

944
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,559
also it's even

945
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
i won't cover that today but we can even

946
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,240
benefit from recycling phosphor that way

947
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,320
um this is basically how composting goes

948
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
there's the first second or third phase

949
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,720
they usually occur in order

950
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
but the temperature changes it starts

951
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
off around 40ish degree celsius if

952
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
you're american you need to look on the

953
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,519
other side

954
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,320
and then it can go up to 70.

955
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,560
um there are bacteria that really like

956
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,119
to be the thermolithic bacteria they're

957
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,040
yeah some of them they all have their

958
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,480
own niche and some of them like to be

959
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,879
hot but they're also cooler versions so

960
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,440
you can also do the process here that

961
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
process happens in a few weeks this one

962
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,040
takes a few months so if you're looking

963
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
into heating your home over winter this

964
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
is the option

965
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,239
until

966
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,800
the winter becomes so small that well

967
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
that would be different

968
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,359
um

969
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,359
so how much energy can we get from there

970
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,440
well a kilogram of plant waste a

971
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,359
calculation calculation calculation a

972
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,440
kilogram of plant waste is about 1.2

973
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,280
kilowatt hours

974
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
check it for please before before you

975
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
take it but i've basically assumed that

976
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,839
our body is uh is doing its best to

977
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,440
to do the same process because it's

978
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,520
quite likely although that this is

979
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
oxygenated

980
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,680
but um basically you have about 1.2

981
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,200
kilowatt hours and i've seen people

982
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
building showers that they use over

983
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
summer with with compost getting these

984
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
high temperatures of course and they did

985
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,599
like 500 showers in a cubic meter so

986
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,520
that just about fits

987
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,839
um a single shower with three kilowatt

988
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,079
hours 20 minutes with a uh saving cap

989
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,920
and would need two and a half kilograms

990
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,079
of plant waste you produce about half a

991
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,160
kilogram a day by the way

992
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,680
so that's not a complete solution but

993
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
it's interesting

994
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,599
now there are a few few rules um you

995
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,520
want to avoid rotting ammonia rodents

996
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,079
it's pretty easy i mean any gardener can

997
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,320
do it it's really quite trivial you need

998
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
to get

999
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,040
get get some trust in yourself to do

1000
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
that there are three factors by which

1001
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
you can control the speed by which the

1002
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
process happens you you lower the time

1003
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
that i have left all the time can't you

1004
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,400
can't you make it go up can't you

1005
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,640
collaborate here come on

1006
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,680
oh well

1007
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,920
um there are three factors of thank you

1008
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,480
there are three factors of speed control

1009
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,200
moist being one um the amount of heat

1010
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
that goes out i mean if you don't want

1011
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
the 70 degrees just

1012
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,280
take out enough heat so that it drops to

1013
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
240 of course

1014
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
um

1015
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,440
and

1016
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,520
basically you could

1017
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,560
have a pro thermostat that is very

1018
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,200
slowly responding influencing these

1019
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,160
things

1020
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
what gardeners also do is they turn the

1021
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
pile inside out you could figure out

1022
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
some screw or something that a

1023
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,240
archimedes screw or something that does

1024
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
that

1025
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,359
that's a bit fantastic

1026
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,119
okay practice

1027
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,680
this is what i what i made i spent eight

1028
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,480
euros worth of money i really invested

1029
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
big time um

1030
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,400
i had i had a large bag i filled it with

1031
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
i had large bag i filled it with leaves

1032
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,599
leaf litter is just about the easiest to

1033
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,520
compost anywhere because it just takes

1034
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,760
the microbes just add a spoonful of

1035
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,960
ground is

1036
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,280
for try it's it thrives with bacteria it

1037
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,760
will happily chew away at that so this

1038
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,839
is about half cubic meter half a meter

1039
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,320
thickness i i aim for i added a good

1040
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
layer of insulation so that basically i

1041
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,400
have when it gets hot

1042
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,079
near the insulation it just reflects

1043
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
back so it's not like getting rid of the

1044
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,560
heat so it can actually get hot

1045
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,760
um unfortunately what i did wrong is

1046
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,160
um it belched out

1047
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,800
so i had a really thick piece here that

1048
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
burned really fast so in short time i

1049
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,680
had a pretty hot warm home so i know to

1050
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,200
to be a better constructor but i also

1051
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
know i'm not very good at that so maybe

1052
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
we should get help whatever

1053
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,599
um but this is underneath a concrete

1054
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,680
staircase in my home it's central while

1055
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,520
the sides are usually warm there are

1056
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,160
actual rooms and it's just a hallway and

1057
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
that hallway tends to be chilly in the

1058
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,400
winter and this actually helped to make

1059
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
it more comfortable

1060
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,079
that's just opportunistic just avoiding

1061
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
that heat can escape but um it really

1062
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
worked well

1063
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,280
and of course this is a room with there

1064
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,359
was some floor ventilation it's it's the

1065
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,960
the garage and it has some floor

1066
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
ventilation so

1067
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
any co2 would easily get out and that

1068
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,640
did indeed work

1069
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,800
so big lesson was a lot of fun and there

1070
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,720
are a few concrete

1071
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,400
lessons as well

1072
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,079
now

1073
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,320
very important is that nature's pretty

1074
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
much figured out all the recipes need so

1075
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,160
all the microbes that we need are pretty

1076
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
much around us they will find the spots

1077
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,880
to work in

1078
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,119
if we change niches if we find new

1079
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,920
niches niches to work in we are in

1080
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
trouble because then nature starts

1081
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,440
inventing new solutions

1082
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,000
microbes reproduce very fast so they

1083
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,720
will very quickly adapt their genome

1084
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
very quickly form new species

1085
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,040
if you play around with beer that's not

1086
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,280
a problem that's a known recipe

1087
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,000
but if you do things like heating up the

1088
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,119
climate

1089
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
or having poor hygiene

1090
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,440
where animals suddenly or people

1091
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,200
suddenly get in touch with poo for

1092
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
example or with

1093
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
dead bodies or

1094
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,920
those

1095
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,119
difficult things or when

1096
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,160
animals get include like uh

1097
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
rabbits used to get mixomitosu when they

1098
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
get they multiply very easily when they

1099
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
get too close they form mixopatos and

1100
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
basically contaminate each other and

1101
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,599
massively die out

1102
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,400
that's useful regulation mechanism

1103
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,320
but it uses basically these mechanisms

1104
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
if you take this to the extreme you're

1105
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
basically doing biologic weapon

1106
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
development research and development

1107
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,240
strictly forbidden in just about any

1108
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,480
decent country

1109
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,920
in this case even the netherlands is

1110
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,599
pretty decent

1111
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,680
but somehow

1112
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,160
animal farming does exactly those things

1113
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,359
it has sick animals locked up in cages

1114
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,079
too near to each other can't move out of

1115
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,400
the way when when it gets too hot

1116
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,280
we are actually causing

1117
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
mutations of microbes together with

1118
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,520
climate changes even worse i can only

1119
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,200
think of one difference between these

1120
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,680
two

1121
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,520
this one is strictly hygienic in a

1122
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
laboratory and this one is opening the

1123
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,240
plane

1124
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
next to you

1125
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,920
that really worries me i've talked to

1126
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,079
margaret about this after our prime

1127
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,400
minister i've written a long letter

1128
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
um of course got no response i mean

1129
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,160
there's probably no money to be made or

1130
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,680
something

1131
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,920
or was too difficult

1132
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
all these letters

1133
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
it didn't fit in this nokia i'm sure

1134
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,560
that must have been it

1135
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,319
i asked the responsible government

1136
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,040
department lmva in our country

1137
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,680
how do they protect us against

1138
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,160
mutilations what's the r that we can

1139
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
expect what's risk of it passing over to

1140
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,880
humans and what would then the r factor

1141
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,640
be they don't have an idea

1142
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,880
there are a few brands like the monkey

1143
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,359
pox they probably saw that coming that

1144
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,040
the ones that they know from other

1145
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,880
countries they know about

1146
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
and they try to monitor and they have a

1147
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
monitoring signaling system basically

1148
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
they start flapping around like headless

1149
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,839
chicken to

1150
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,480
try and contain the problem which is

1151
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,079
definitely not

1152
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,359
uh

1153
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,800
guaranteed if it's going to be a

1154
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,560
flu-like virus because they're extremely

1155
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
contagious for us

1156
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,920
um

1157
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,800
so i'm i'm really concerned about this

1158
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,640
i'm not saying we should stop animal

1159
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,520
farming i should i think i i think we

1160
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
should start animal fighting

1161
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
animal farming again

1162
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,960
but do it so that animals are healthy

1163
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
and full of life

1164
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
and whatever it takes to do that is what

1165
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
you need to do i think that's basically

1166
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,200
what i told margaret but then again

1167
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,280
for every day um whole plant yeah um

1168
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
basically i've covered all of this most

1169
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,760
important thing there are a few angles

1170
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,599
where you can play you can make build a

1171
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,839
controller for your compost you can play

1172
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,280
with that i haven't done that yet i'm

1173
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,960
definitely going to

1174
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,280
um and publish it please share the

1175
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
knowledge

1176
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
because if i get something work and then

1177
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
i have a thousand similar homes that can

1178
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,040
do the same

1179
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,319
they're also very intrigued about

1180
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,800
getting rid of this incredibly poor

1181
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,520
heating network anyway

1182
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,000
and document it please so that nobody

1183
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,960
can get patents about it

1184
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,599
so that's what i wanted to say

1185
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,079
thank you very much and maybe there are

1186
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,830
questions

1187
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,140
[Music]

1188
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,290
[Applause]

1189
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,119
we do have some time left so if there

1190
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,640
are questions please line up at the

1191
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
microphones in the middle of the room

1192
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,839
and feel free to ask

1193
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,200
yes he said i should haste him so that

1194
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,839
you could ask questions

1195
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
anyone

1196
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
yes

1197
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,440
microphone in the front please it's a

1198
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,599
very unknown area that's probably why

1199
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,119
people are a bit um they need to think

1200
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,880
you were talking quite fast but it was

1201
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,560
really interesting they need to think

1202
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
you were talking quite fast but it was

1203
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,760
really interesting so

1204
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,839
yeah i don't think there's many psy or

1205
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,160
chemistry talks here but um you said

1206
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,760
that the um

1207
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,480
energy for the urine and urea

1208
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,079
was um

1209
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,359
like purely theoretical um

1210
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,839
if there have there been any realistic

1211
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,680
like attempts at extracting that energy

1212
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,440
and do we know like what percentage of

1213
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
the theoretical that has reached yet

1214
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,040
um

1215
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,040
yes

1216
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,880
this machine ran not on urine by the way

1217
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
but on flies and searching scraps found

1218
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
around um but on organic waste for seven

1219
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,440
days

1220
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,599
with 48 of these things and you can see

1221
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,119
it has two volts apparently

1222
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,800
because those meters have faults over

1223
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,880
there i believe

1224
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
and it's been autonomous for for a week

1225
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,920
it's basically done it's on its task

1226
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,880
there are small scale setups

1227
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,280
you can definitely burn a led on it

1228
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,880
that's easy

1229
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,599
and there's more to be had

1230
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,359
but that basically lat is already a bit

1231
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,880
of power out compared to a

1232
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,800
microcontroller i think you could run a

1233
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,560
microcontroller on it

1234
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,520
um

1235
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,560
it depends very much because um

1236
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,680
not all these will have the same output

1237
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,839
um and they're like uneven batteries and

1238
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,280
you know what happens then one starts

1239
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,359
charging the other it's it gets out of

1240
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,839
balance one of the things we might do to

1241
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,119
improve this

1242
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,440
we as a community i mean um helping out

1243
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
these researchers is to find ways of

1244
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
switching voltage or something or pile

1245
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,480
them up such that we don't get the the

1246
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
loss of energy from that

1247
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
there are many things that need to be

1248
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,640
researched basically it's a tinkering

1249
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,560
area and the interesting thing is that i

1250
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,319
think there are less than 10 researchers

1251
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,760
working on this

1252
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,599
um so it's

1253
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,760
we can expand extra incredibly on this

1254
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,720
and it has a huge problem uh potential

1255
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,119
okay thank you okay microphone in the

1256
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,400
back please

1257
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,640
hey hello uh thanks for the great talk

1258
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,880
um if i'm if i'm lawn mowing so if i'm

1259
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
mowing grass and put that all on a big

1260
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,560
pie it gets so hot i fear it will ignite

1261
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,319
so yeah could you say what process that

1262
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,079
is and could we use that that is the

1263
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
composting process

1264
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,920
okay and yes you could use that although

1265
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,720
i don't know how fast your grass grows

1266
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,880
but yeah that's exactly that's probably

1267
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,119
70 degrees you could measure it

1268
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
measure the inside of course would get

1269
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
the outside is going to be colder but

1270
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,280
yeah vapor tends to come off as well

1271
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,160
because

1272
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
ch constructions are turned into two in

1273
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,520
h2o so you will see steam escaping as

1274
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,839
well so you might even cycle that back

1275
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,720
or retain it or use that for energy

1276
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,520
um

1277
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,720
yeah that's basically what i'm talking

1278
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,240
about when i'm saying compost can be

1279
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,000
heating source

1280
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,800
okay thanks okay and microwave

1281
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640
in general when you take plant waste you

1282
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
put it in a pile it's going to turn into

1283
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,040
compost that's almost always what always

1284
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,520
happens provided there's oxygen if

1285
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
there's no oxygen it's going to rot and

1286
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,520
you are going to notice

1287
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,079
okay i'm going to try that okay

1288
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,440
microphone in the back please again

1289
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
your front hello tessa hi

1290
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,520
um i have a question about the um

1291
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,040
the bio

1292
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,160
uh

1293
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,040
gas

1294
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,040
is i believe what it's called

1295
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
uh where you take

1296
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
rotten uh

1297
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
fruit and vegetables and stuff well

1298
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,440
biogas it create biogas yeah and you

1299
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,839
mentioned that it creates uh this gas

1300
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,280
and co2 yeah but isn't the co2 already

1301
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
in the

1302
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,760
um

1303
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
the the bio waste and will will it be

1304
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,240
released anyway

1305
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,200
um

1306
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,880
yes it would also be released in a

1307
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,040
composting process yes

1308
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,520
um what i'm saying is this is an extra

1309
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
one that you need to look not just the

1310
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,079
ch4 but also co2 is a double warning

1311
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,599
that you should really look where it

1312
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,880
comes from

1313
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,960
um make sure that it's something that

1314
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,119
will indeed bind back again next year

1315
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,359
and not burn down or break down trees or

1316
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,319
trunks or or branches or whatever these

1317
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,119
have been around for very long um they

1318
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,040
probably don't grow anymore but

1319
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,880
we had a co2 problem before we started

1320
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,359
cutting down trees for co2 like enschede

1321
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,200
is doing terrible city to live in

1322
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,680
sometimes so so maybe

1323
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
only make uh biogas from things that are

1324
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,240
already dead

1325
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,839
like um

1326
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,240
like bananas bananas peel shells i i i i

1327
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,040
i don't know if it's dead but yeah

1328
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,480
okay basically when it wants to

1329
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,960
decompose when it can't retain its

1330
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
intact structure and that's what you

1331
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,680
could call that right yes

1332
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,359
microphone in front please

1333
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,040
i am not actually that familiar of

1334
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,440
composting myself but i'm very curious

1335
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,599
are there any uh any waste products that

1336
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,920
you need to worry about when composting

1337
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
because

1338
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
composting would also produce co2 and

1339
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,319
possibly methane right yes usually you

1340
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,079
do composting with stuff you have in

1341
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
your kitchen you don't want to add

1342
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,079
boiled foods you don't want to add

1343
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,440
cheese or meat

1344
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,680
because that would attract rodents

1345
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,040
you might like them i most people don't

1346
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,839
but materially no and if you're

1347
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,440
any bit afraid you wash wash your hands

1348
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,680
with soap afterwards

1349
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,079
yeah this is more about uh when you do

1350
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,960
it indoor uh the gases that come with it

1351
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,640
yeah yeah definitely yeah that's what i

1352
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,000
said when you do this indoors you need

1353
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,680
to have an exhaust for the co2 and

1354
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,119
that's why i said in my garage on the

1355
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,160
bottom where co2 lands usually there's

1356
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,200
ventilation yes thank you yeah and

1357
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,118
microphone in the back please

1358
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,920
uh you said uh you asked us if he could

1359
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,720
doc

1360
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,800
document our findings and i was

1361
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
wondering do you have any pointers for

1362
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,640
that like what should we document where

1363
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,359
should we document it yeah and uh yeah

1364
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,440
yeah yeah of course

1365
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,920
td comments is what i usually do

1366
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,200
um

1367
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,079
they're

1368
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,760
started by google but they are run by

1369
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,359
publisher i don't know which one anyone

1370
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,440
but there's some long term arrangements

1371
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,400
so that it will work quite well um td

1372
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,079
commons is the name it's in one of the

1373
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,640
footnotes here it is

1374
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,800
and basically you print a pdf you upload

1375
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,559
it takes two three weeks of course you

1376
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,040
don't need to do this just for this this

1377
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
is just a general if you want to avoid

1378
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,200
patents use it please do when i think of

1379
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,440
new ideas with solar boilers for example

1380
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,280
i first write it there and then i talk

1381
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,880
to someone about it

1382
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
because i don't want this sustainable

1383
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
technology to be patented because it

1384
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,079
should be everyone's it should be for

1385
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,920
the people not for the companies and do

1386
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,200
you have any suggestion what

1387
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,440
specifically we should document what

1388
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,520
parts like

1389
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,559
oh um any

1390
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,920
if you play around with this you

1391
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,319
discover something like this material or

1392
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,119
um like if i put a thread in it or if i

1393
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,720
use um they've done things like using um

1394
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,760
um

1395
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,160
active car coil with which

1396
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,720
active cargo which has very high surface

1397
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,920
area they've

1398
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,599
stuck that in a particular way on a

1399
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,440
carbon sheet and use that as an

1400
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,839
electrode so that many elec

1401
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,040
bacteria could could attach for example

1402
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,880
now those things are wonderful but i'm

1403
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,640
not sure that one is

1404
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,160
patented or not

1405
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,440
but that's the sort of thing you don't

1406
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,440
want to think about right

1407
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,280
um i i said this shouldn't be

1408
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,040
sustainable technology shouldn't be for

1409
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
companies what i actually mean is not

1410
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,480
for a single company we don't want

1411
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,559
monopolies

1412
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,240
okay and the last question from the

1413
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,800
micro on the front please uh yeah i was

1414
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,359
wondering what your thoughts are on

1415
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,960
genetic engineering for example

1416
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,400
cyanobacteria to be able to

1417
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,119
take sunlight and co2 and

1418
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,119
produce uh

1419
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,640
i think it's scary

1420
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,720
because it's an expensive process and it

1421
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,480
means it can only be done by companies

1422
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,720
like monsanto who have a lot of money to

1423
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
spend and who basically want to sell

1424
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,599
their

1425
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,040
um

1426
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,800
how do you call it

1427
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,160
um

1428
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,760
they've got this terrible poison that

1429
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,400
kills just about all life

1430
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,000
ground up thank you

1431
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,880
um

1432
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,240
um and

1433
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,000
basically they genetically engineer

1434
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,760
things so that they're

1435
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,240
compatible and this is spreading

1436
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,520
and since they have a patent they're

1437
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,559
actually

1438
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,319
filing charges against farmers in

1439
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,319
neighboring fields who happen to have

1440
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,079
picked up this because they naturally

1441
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,200
recycle the seeds

1442
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,599
i'm not a big fan do you also think it's

1443
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,800
dangerous

1444
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,520
but

1445
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,599
those are maybe i i think in every

1446
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,599
technology you can have you can use it

1447
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,520
for good or you can do it use it for bad

1448
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,920
things but there are also for example

1449
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
igem teams that really

1450
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,400
get into

1451
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,040
also genetically engineering organisms

1452
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,359
but to create

1453
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,319
some application that we can use

1454
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,160
and

1455
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,079
yeah don't you think that that could

1456
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,960
also

1457
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,839
provide for a solution sometimes

1458
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,960
instead of just being evil

1459
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,480
do you agree if you've been here during

1460
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,559
the previous lecture he said we have a

1461
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,280
great religious belief in technology but

1462
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,599
usually solves one problem and creates

1463
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,079
five others

1464
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,920
we are pretty good at abstracting and

1465
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,319
looking at one section of a problem only

1466
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,000
and solving that

1467
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,680
and that's also the mindset behind

1468
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,640
genetic engineering so i am incredibly

1469
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,119
cautious

1470
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,960
so i i'm not saying black or white i'm

1471
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,599
saying dark

1472
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,520
thank you yeah thank you thank you all

1473
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,960
for the questions

1474
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,640
then you will be open for questions

1475
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,640
outside if there are more oh yeah okay

1476
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,559
perfect then thank you very much for

1477
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,370
this really interesting talk

1478
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,630
