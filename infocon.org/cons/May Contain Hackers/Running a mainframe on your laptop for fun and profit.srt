Aaron is going to talk to us running a

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,199
Mainframe on your laptop for Fun and

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,520
Profit take it away

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,099
ah okay uh hello everybody

I'm going to present you with the choice

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
um there's this choice I can do either a

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,980
very boring standard introduction of who

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,420
I am or I can do a pretty well it's a

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,760
high impact kind of introduction of who

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,820
I am so show of hands who owns the

21

all who won't stay I even won great

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
um and who wants a high impact you know

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,780
full circle and oh my God what am I

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,780
getting into that one okay uh why do

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,100
people choose that one I never

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,979
understand that okay but you will get it

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,060
um I have to go to the other screen

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,259
who

31
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,759
back

32
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,560
yeah and then click here yes okay so who

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,759
am I

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,579
um I'm the father of five uh these are

35
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,680
the five uh please notice there's one

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
girl in a wheelchair uh we're going to

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,540
talk about that a little bit more uh but

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,600
there's also one that I'm holding who is

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,079
um uh mentally very challenged uh I used

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,020
to be a firefighter for 10 years so I

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,840
love to

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
work on cars after a car crash uh

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
hopefully without many uh severe

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,800
injuries

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,020
um yeah I'm saving a dog who was

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,640
swimming which is normally pretty

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
healthy but not in the middle of the

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,480
winter when there's a hole in the middle

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,220
of the ice and he can't get out and he

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,200
gets hypothermia and at some point he

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,020
would drown but he we saved him so yay

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
everybody's all right this is my helmet

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,000
and the front part of it the black part

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,700
in the middle is melted so it was a

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,319
little hot but it was an exercise and

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,480
actually it was pretty fun and not for

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
my chief because he had to replace that

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,739
and he had a budget and he didn't like

59
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,500
that but I did

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,260
I do stuff with scouting so I even

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,420
combined firefighting with the boy

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,280
scouting we are now as you know probably

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
on the Dutch scouting grounds

64
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,900
um so the large event fields

65
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,599
and I there's some events some larger

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,900
events same size as MCH actually with a

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,220
lot of Scouts from all over the world

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,739
love to do that

69
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,720
I wrote a couple of books I'm now

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,300
currently busy with my 14th book I

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,239
believe I don't know why I must be

72
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,580
pretty insane somewhere these are three

73
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
of the type some type of topics are in

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,860
English some are in in in Dutch and I'm

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,040
caretaker of course so there we go

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,379
and it also shows with all this photo

77
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,480
the balance in your life that you try to

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,159
do things but there are also other

79
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,739
things more important

80
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,920
um and uh oh yeah by the way I also

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
manage an open source project it's

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,860
called liberal plan who does open source

83
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,159
project management uh planning software

84
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,400
pretty cool and up there is the logo I

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
don't know if you can see it but it's

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,459
there

87
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,560
um so this is the boring slide because I

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,840
couldn't jump over it

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,560
um so it's the same uh I I try to solve

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,439
I.T problems and the rest I already told

91
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,780
you so this is the boring slide so what

92
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,239
do you think should I next time do again

93
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,060
this choice or should I skip it and go

94
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,340
just to the boring slide which is pretty

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,959
standard for everybody who does a talk

96
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,079
who's in favor of keeping the boring

97
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,880
slide and do the oh

98
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
okay and who's in favor of the you know

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
the high impact you you get to learn me

100
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,300
a little bit okay oh okay thank you so

101
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,220
much

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,840
um okay uh what do I do uh

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,580
training retraining I love to retrain

104
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,460
people from whatever they did to into it

105
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,620
love to do that

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,020
um okay leave a plan this is a

107
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,180
screenshot of liberal plan let's skip

108
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,580
that and go oh yeah

109
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,180
um who here is not Dutch

110
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,699
a lot of people great

111
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,220
um so then this is important

112
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,520
um the Dutch on average speak pretty

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,060
well English but we're not English

114
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,639
um and this is a very nice anglo-dutch

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,460
translation guide where if a British guy

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,680
would say with all due respect

117
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,800
I would hear oh he's listening to me

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,479
he's respecting me we've got a nice

119
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,320
dialogue going on well it actually sings

120
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
I think you're wrong

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,160
you know so those intricacies those

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,759
subtle nuances not with the Dutch you

123
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,199
know we're blunt and we speak English

124
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,539
and that's it deal with it basically

125
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,280
sorry

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,160
um okay let's go to the topic what's a

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,560
Mainframe a Mainframe is a piece of

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,900
Hardware that's

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,620
um

130
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,680
sole purpose and soul design is massive

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,620
parallel in Hardware massive

132
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,220
parallelization in Hardware so every

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,620
thing that happens see the computer has

134
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,440
its own piece of Hardware so yeah there

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,620
is a CPU but the CPU is only used to do

136
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,380
what the CPU does best which is a little

137
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,900
bit of calculation it's not a

138
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,380
supercomputer a supercomputer is is one

139
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,600
or a bunch of computers who try to

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,400
calculate some very complex

141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,199
calculation in the shortest possible

142
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,319
time and Mainframe is all about

143
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,319
throughput getting as much data as

144
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
possible from A to B in as little at

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,660
time as possible so how did they do that

146
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,360
in Mainframe they design a piece of

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,240
Hardware to to offload everything from

148
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,600
the CPU so networking is a separate

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,380
component

150
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
storage is a separate company everything

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,600
is separated from the CPU so the CPU

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,819
does one thing and that's calculate your

153
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,440
daily interest on your bank account

154
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,199
every night and that for I don't know a

155
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,720
gazillion people

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,759
um so that's the Mainframe we're done

157
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,220
right oh no sorry

158
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,000
um

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,099
uh oh yeah I'm going to talk about

160
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,380
Hercules Hercules is an open source

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,280
project

162
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,819
and it's an IBM Mainframe emulator so

163
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,060
it's like virtualization you know the

164
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,759
the virtual box the kvms the vmware's of

165
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,039
this world we all know them some of them

166
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,759
we even love a Hercules is the same at

167
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,340
this in the software it emulates the

168
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,360
hardware

169
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,880
so you can't do a hardware

170
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,860
virtualization because you have an Intel

171
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,720
processor in your laptop and not a

172
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,300
Mainframe CPU so you do everything in

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,460
software it makes it very very slowly

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,460
but there's also good news

175
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,419
um

176
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,940
and I'll come to that later it runs on

177
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,900
Linux Windows 3bz and Mac OS what does

178
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,639
it look like well on the left you have

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,180
the original panel of a mainframe system

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,639
all right you have this time is I found

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,860
it online a window screenshot of

182
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,560
Hercules which also has this very weird

183
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,139
turning knobs at the top that I know

184
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,419
nothing about oh yeah I forgot to tell

185
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,699
you I I love to do talks I do a lot of

186
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,740
talks about subjects and this subject I

187
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,259
know almost nothing about

188
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,479
and almost part is what I'm going to

189
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,639
tell you today

190
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,680
so if there's anybody here with

191
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,020
Mainframe experience you know way more

192
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,120
than I do

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,840
um

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,940
but if you've never worked with a

195
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,300
Mainframe I know more than you okay

196
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,039
um so what does it do well it runs

197
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,099
software do there are many os's in

198
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,039
public domain if you have a license and

199
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,799
the IBM Hardware you can run several IBM

200
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,320
os's on Hercules but if you don't have

201
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,140
the hardware most of us don't then you

202
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,880
can only run the open source of

203
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,100
variations

204
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,019
and a lot of these os's were developed

205
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,200
in the 50s 60s and 70s of last century

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
and they were even open source because

207
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
they were paid by a grant from the

208
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,519
United States uh government uh with the

209
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,980
the mandatory Clause the closet had to

210
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,279
be open source licensed so uh that

211
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,700
worked until 1972.

212
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,660
so you can run software from 1970 to

213
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,339
completely open source completely legal

214
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,140
on Hercules and still have a fun time

215
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,399
and that's what we're going to show you

216
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
today

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
um so what can you run you can run OS

218
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,500
360.360.vs

219
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,180
mvs and mvs is the one we're going to

220
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,399
focus on today because it's the easiest

221
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,060
and uh it's the most active but if

222
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,820
you're really into bizarre things the

223
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,920
other ones you can also download also

224
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,019
our web page is describing how you

225
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,300
should install them in Hercules with

226
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,720
very Arcane commands and you can really

227
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,700
dive into that if you if you're into

228
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,660
that

229
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,420
uh and you can even run Linux of course

230
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,700
in Hercules

231
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,420
um well when I started to look into

232
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Hercules I knew nothing about mainframes

233
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,459
well they were big expensive boxes

234
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,800
that's basically it

235
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,899
um and

236
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,839
um I I Googled Hercules I read about it

237
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,940
somewhere I don't know and I found the

238
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,820
original site of the Hercules project

239
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,579
and it was last updated 12 years ago

240
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,579
which is not really very active you

241
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,480
would think

242
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,940
uh currently it's down so you can't go

243
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,560
there anymore and the last snapshot on

244
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,660
archives the dog was from May this year

245
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,300
so it's recently gone down

246
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,940
um I followed the site to a certain Mr

247
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,060
Maynard last modified even way before

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,339
that 2004.

249
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,500
um there was a meaning uh mailing list

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,779
with seven thousand members on Yahoo

251
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,079
groups that list is gone by now so uh

252
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,480
all seven thousand people well had to go

253
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,820
somewhere else

254
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,620
and I read about an easy start thing the

255
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,180
volkers MV s3.aj TurnKey system version

256
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,740
three

257
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,720
I'm going to talk a little bit about

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,980
that it's a long title but it's very

259
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
easy really very easy second time I did

260
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,600
this talk in Sheffield people in the

261
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,120
audience immediately downloaded the

262
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,380
software and started playing with it

263
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,480
while I was doing the talk it was that

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,100
easy

265
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,380
um anyway long time project leader Jay

266
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,620
Maynard and all in all if you look

267
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,820
around

268
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,620
um lights are on but there's nobody home

269
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,560
you could mail him no response turns out

270
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,839
he run the pro project for a long time

271
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
and at some point got bored and and

272
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,899
stopped and then actually stopped no

273
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,060
transference of authority now simply

274
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,079
stop

275
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,980
everything went to death no that's it

276
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,440
um and um

277
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,019
a long time I even thought he was

278
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,380
deceased you know it happens but um at

279
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,240
some point he um

280
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,420
he he came online and said well he ain't

281
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,560
dead

282
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,720
that's good news I guess

283
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,760
uh may not be a false in Hercules

284
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,079
anymore but they haven't gone anywhere

285
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,240
he's into other projects now

286
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,420
so what should you do if this interests

287
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,860
you

288
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,779
um well there's a new main site Hercules

289
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,800
Dash 390.eu that's where and it's it

290
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,019
started with a copy of the old site with

291
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,440
a couple of updates and it's it still

292
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,200
doesn't look very fancy but it's now the

293
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,160
the go-to place for this project

294
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
um there's a new mailing list on Google

295
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,600
Groups

296
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
um well they lost about uh a lot around

297
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,660
90 of audience but there's still 700-ish

298
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,120
members and there's still this easy

299
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,100
start but now there's been an upgrade

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,839
and mps3. yay TurnKey for dash system by

301
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,399
Jurgen winkelmann is the latest

302
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,740
incarnation of uh of mvs or for Hercules

303
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,320
uh this is the site this is where you

304
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,540
can download a zip file and it it's got

305
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,399
everything it's got Hercules for Linux

306
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,660
Windows Mac uh it's got mvs hard disk

307
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,480
images so you just unzip the zip file

308
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
start a command and you've got a

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,620
Mainframe up and running on your laptop

310
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,420
it's that easy

311
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,060
what it looks like still 50 minutes left

312
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,820
oh man I just started oh my God

313
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,860
uh okay

314
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,700
um yeah you can learn by a lot of lots

315
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,480
of videos on on YouTube about this

316
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,820
um uh what you need well PC of course

317
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,160
Raspberry Pi works too because there's a

318
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,620
port of Hercules to arm

319
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,519
um and the Mainframe communicates with

320
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,620
terminals through a protocol that's

321
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,440
called 3270 that's the communication

322
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
protocol so you need to have a 3270

323
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,800
emulator to connect to a Mainframe but

324
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,260
that's easy because in your uh if you

325
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,920
use Linux you have

326
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,019
x3270 packages ready in your repository

327
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,940
you can install and you can connect to

328
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,040
the Mainframe

329
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,959
um

330
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,600
no this is a very small Mainframe of

331
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,540
course sitting on a manual

332
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,180
oh yeah this is very important uh even

333
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,440
if I got few minutes left this is vital

334
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
storage in Mainframe means memory

335
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
because hard drives came way later first

336
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,899
they had this punching cards and they

337
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,240
had a CPU and memory that's a storage is

338
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,980
memory

339
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,980
um Dash D is directly attached storage

340
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,500
device and that's a hard disk what we

341
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,579
call Drive

342
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,839
they use it still call it a destiny uh

343
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,600
TSO is a time sharing option that's uh

344
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
uh a piece of software in your Mainframe

345
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,420
OS that makes it multi-user oh you were

346
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,660
wrong

347
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,339
thank you so much

348
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm here in a panic and you're

349
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,060
how much time do I have ah I've got a

350
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,740
half an hour left I'm speeding up and

351
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,540
whoa

352
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,860
we're going to talk about this later

353
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,740
young man

354
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,440
okay anyway so

355
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,420
um time sharing option if you don't if

356
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,339
you didn't buy the time sharing option

357
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,500
on your OS you had a very expensive

358
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,860
single user system talk about weird

359
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,639
software the GS2 is a job entry system

360
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,519
released too clearly the

361
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,980
um because a Mainframe works with job

362
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
cues so you are working in your terminal

363
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,500
uh your editing at some point and it's

364
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,680
blocked screen or you're oriented so you

365
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,980
you send a screen to the system it one

366
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,079
of the subsystems manages that and you

367
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,899
get a new screen back

368
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,720
um so no interactivity no mouse simply

369
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,519
keyboard work

370
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,100
um and at some point you submit your

371
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,440
code and then it comes in a queue

372
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,019
because a Mainframe is expensive and

373
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,220
it's it's a Workhorse it needs to do it

374
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,440
give it something to do you know it it

375
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,540
does a lot of stuff

376
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,519
um so you get in the queue and at some

377
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,500
point you're you're it's your turn and

378
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,440
then half a second later it's done your

379
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,720
job and you get the results presented to

380
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,519
you

381
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,019
um kicks is the front that the

382
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,480
transactional software so you can create

383
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,399
sort of gui's for transactional systems

384
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,160
um oh yeah and forget the concept about

385
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,279
files we used in Mainframe they use data

386
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,860
sets and a data set is something that

387
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,199
the Mana the system manager makes for

388
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,259
you so you go to a go to which is admin

389
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,120
I say I need a data set for project

390
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,300
whatever and he says okay what how much

391
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,120
space well I think five megabytes will

392
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,519
probably cover it and you get a data set

393
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,459
of five megabytes and you open the data

394
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,440
set and in the data set you will have

395
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,199
your files and your data files and

396
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,839
whatever you have so that's a very funny

397
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,919
way of very good way of preventing a

398
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,419
system from getting overloaded

399
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,179
unexpected overloaded drives because hey

400
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,000
you can't go past the boundaries of your

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,740
data set

402
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,679
and you can also not extend them I

403
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,319
believe so if you run out of space you

404
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,939
have to ask for a new data set and

405
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,860
transfer everything to the new data set

406
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,280
and after that you can continue

407
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,919
and the catalog is well the sort of a

408
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,200
system list of available software so the

409
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
the catalog contains the the links to

410
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,679
the Cobalt compiler and the GCC yeah the

411
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,700
GCC for for mvs

412
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,200
or whatever programming language you

413
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,340
like

414
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,320
uh well what you will see when you log

415
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,260
in is this screen so this is what this

416
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,980
is what well what it looked like

417
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,460
um and you log on and um yeah then you

418
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,660
get a menu

419
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,640
a terminal has on 32 70 has dedicated

420
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
keys that you don't have on your

421
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,500
keyboard so there is a a keyboard map

422
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,059
that you can open

423
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,880
uh it starts if you it starts with a

424
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,559
very small

425
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,200
um icon at the top on the left and when

426
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,840
you open you get this key map and a few

427
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,660
keys are important one of them is enter

428
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,080
that means send my stuff which also does

429
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,960
the enter key that's easy part but you

430
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,780
will do stuff wrong and when you do

431
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,120
stuff wrong on the GUI level it doesn't

432
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,179
hurt Mainframe he's not aware of it but

433
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,880
it will lock up your terminal it will it

434
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,640
will show you an X in the bottom

435
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,520
right here saying I don't know what you

436
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,320
did mate but it doesn't work like that

437
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,080
and you have to reset your terminal and

438
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,700
that's this button

439
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,039
so it's a software kind of terminal

440
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
reset stiff thingy trust me you will use

441
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
that

442
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,120
um

443
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,620
demo time

444
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,380
are we up for a small demo

445
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,179
or are we asleep

446
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,020
who's asleep

447
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,780
okay

448
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,320
um this is going to be funny I have to

449
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,100
switch my screen and oh the pressure of

450
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,399
time

451
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,559
where's my mouse there's my mouse I know

452
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,620
here's my mouse talk

453
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,399
settings

454
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,700
displays display

455
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,840
a mirror apply

456
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,380
keep changes yeah we all see the same

457
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,679
now

458
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,539
open up a terminal

459
00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:00,539
and I will start an X D2 as this one is

460
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,600
a little bit small so I'll try to

461
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,100
option font

462
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,539
uh this one

463
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:16,640
this one and then 20 20 27 which was 20.

464
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,280
yeah this one so it's a little bit

465
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,640
bigger can you see this

466
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,620
in the middle I because I don't know if

467
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
you can I hope you can see it okay

468
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,960
um this is all we have for today uh so

469
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,679
open the key map it's there uh CD TK4

470
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,900
I've unzipped the file of course it's

471
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,140
all in here uh it's got the linear

472
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,780
scripts and everything

473
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,220
and I think you can do the same as I can

474
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,640
mvas that's it now what I'll see now is

475
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,980
the console lock that's starting up the

476
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,780
system

477
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,780
mounting the dasd system that those are

478
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,320
the the hard disks and I can connect

479
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,740
from my terminal to localhost

480
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,039
I cannot yet log in it will take a few

481
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,820
seconds

482
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
zip

483
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,959
[Music]

484
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,419
always prepare your demo

485
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,780
and I did I'm a demo is pretty bad works

486
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,299
like a charm every time

487
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,880
um

488
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,539
reset yeah here we are

489
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,940
zero two

490
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,340
and oh yeah passwords see you later

491
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,620
it's not my password it's in the system

492
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,539
so if you unzip it you have the same

493
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,940
user ID same passwords okay Messi

494
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,860
welcome on the system message of the day

495
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,860
uh fortune cookie and hey here we are

496
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,659
we've got the menu I'm actually running

497
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,380
mvs3.aj Mainframe OS on my laptop well

498
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,419
for Fun and Profit I I don't see a lot

499
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,120
of hilarious people but maybe that will

500
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,640
come later I'm still hopeful

501
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,760
um it's a menu system uh you have to

502
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
understand a few function keys so for

503
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,820
one if I select one enter I get another

504
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,419
menu if I want to go back I press the

505
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,299
function key 3 that we all have on our

506
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,940
keyboard nothing specific about it you

507
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,880
can also click here of course in in the

508
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
in the mapped keyboard window but why

509
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,900
would I

510
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,020
um if I have too much data I can use the

511
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,380
function key seven and eight to to page

512
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,640
through the output

513
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,600
um let's see let's select three and

514
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,200
um here I can select a library uh

515
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,140
because a library is sort of a

516
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,740
a collection of data sets

517
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,460
um

518
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
and

519
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,360
um well data set I already described you

520
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,980
know

521
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,960
um

522
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,140
okay let's do four

523
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,179
and I'm going to use the system JCL lip

524
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,059
Library

525
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,880
and I should do a search for that and

526
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,340
then I get only this list and I have to

527
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,900
select

528
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,880
this Library

529
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,460
uh sorry that's the wrong one I selected

530
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,460
it and I get info I do F3 and I say e of

531
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,880
enter enter hey I'm in I'm in my data

532
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,640
set I see a bunch of files

533
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,140
and

534
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,500
um I can page through them with f8 is to

535
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,960
is down F7 is up

536
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,140
and there is a very nice file that I

537
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,880
would like to you to get to know a

538
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,460
little bit and that's the prime Kobo one

539
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,260
file so I press an e enter hey I've got

540
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,120
COBOL anybody knows Global a little bit

541
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,059
who whoever programmed in Kobo

542
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,279
okay great so do you know there's one

543
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,440
Cobalt joke

544
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,900
there's a new cobalt dialect it's called

545
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,200
polite COBOL and it means at I to B

546
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
giving C please

547
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,900
that's a joke you only understand it if

548
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,360
you've ever programmed a global

549
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,340
um and I see by the response that it's

550
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,440
not even funny okay

551
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,260
um anyway so I can uh walk through this

552
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,860
file this is all COBOL with all parts

553
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,679
and at some point at the top the header

554
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
and that's this part

555
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,340
describes what user will submit this job

556
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,700
and what class it is classes immediate

557
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,120
execution is a and the message class is

558
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,659
where does this go to if I press h is is

559
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,480
for holding so it will have a

560
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,080
um it will output a printer file on the

561
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,120
system but not on a printer

562
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,020
but if you put an A or a B there you

563
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,940
have to pre-configure printers in

564
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,380
hackers of course you can add more

565
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,600
printers if you like

566
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,100
um

567
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,980
anyway uh her because 02a that's what

568
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,679
I've been logged in as so if I press sub

569
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,740
or submit as I was fancier can even

570
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,919
shorter shortened stuff

571
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,159
it will say okay I have a job with

572
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,100
number 41 submitted to the system

573
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,520
okay well I'm done here I guess uh I'll

574
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,140
go back up

575
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,279
and here option eight is the out list

576
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,480
and then way at the bottom I have my job

577
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,240
41 that was submitted that's already

578
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,700
been executed of course because I have a

579
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,340
really fancy laptop at least compared to

580
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,179
a Mainframe from the 70s right

581
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,159
um and I can select this icon at edit an

582
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,720
output file of course because it's an

583
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,419
output file but I can select it and I

584
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,640
see here the output of the job I just

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
submitted

586
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
which shows me uh all compiler messages

587
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,440
a dump of the source code

588
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,779
uh a header etc etc and at some point

589
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,320
yay I've got my Prime list

590
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
and it goes all the way up to ten

591
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,980
thousands ish now and it does this all

592
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,760
in a remarkably short time of it's

593
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,400
somewhere up here

594
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,279
ah execution time there at the top let's

595
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,159
see elapsed time

596
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,659
0.13 seconds

597
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,900
which is pretty good

598
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
for for a laptop

599
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,500
um

600
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,580
so yeah that's that's how stuff works uh

601
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,260
I can F3 F3 my top menu I'm going to log

602
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,740
out I'm going to shut down

603
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,080
and it will start a script that will

604
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,320
show the shutdown system and I will lock

605
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,279
off

606
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,740
and it will start to unmount all the

607
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,919
drives and that was my demo

608
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,740
oh

609
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,559
okay

610
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,360
thank you so much now let's see if I can

611
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,760
go back to the presentation in a timely

612
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,020
manner

613
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,679
um

614
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,580
settings displays

615
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,919
join apply keep changes

616
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,360
where's my here's my presentation uh

617
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,080
uh start from the current slides

618
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,799
and yay that works too wow I'm amazing

619
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,000
today uh okay so what is the performance

620
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,659
of a Mainframe on my laptop compared to

621
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,659
an actual actual Mainframe these days

622
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,899
what's what's the speed difference what

623
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:03,299
factor of speed are we talking about

624
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,919
well uh hooker's performance

625
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,840
we are comparing an i7 processor to a

626
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,620
real IBM z14 and if you know that the

627
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,940
Z16 has just been announced

628
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,960
um it's about this is a about three

629
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,899
years three years old

630
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:27,960
z14 was about three years ago the main

631
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,419
model

632
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,720
um so this is on Hercules so test one

633
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,940
does 344 million instructions per second

634
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,899
ah okay

635
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:43,320
and the Mainframe does 5.8 billion

636
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,960
so you divide those two you do it in

637
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,640
your mind I'll give you a few seconds to

638
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
calculate this you know what else have

639
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,240
you got to do

640
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,760
oh I'll tell you it's about

641
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,559
approximately 16.8 times faster

642
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,419
of course this is

643
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,919
comparing apples to elephants

644
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,840
why because this laptop is not built for

645
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,740
massive throughput and a Mainframe is so

646
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,440
its job is not to calculate prime

647
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
numbers its job on the Mainframe is to

648
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,539
get as much data from A to B and it does

649
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,760
it way faster than any laptop

650
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,500
um and the

651
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,059
the

652
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,100
developments currently in Mainframe are

653
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,260
still state of the art if you think you

654
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,260
have cool Hardware think again Mainframe

655
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,220
Hardware is absolutely way more cool

656
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,200
um we all talk about I you know I've got

657
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,820
a system with a three gigahertz

658
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,460
processor oh that's nice they have

659
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,159
holler than 28 processors at 15 uh sorry

660
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,260
at five gigahertz

661
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,140
you know there has to be a difference

662
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,320
you pay for it don't get me wrong

663
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,299
um okay some updates since the first

664
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,520
time I did the talk more shakes very

665
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,039
nice guy uh made an online system

666
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,020
available so you mail him the

667
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,760
presentation will of course be uploaded

668
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,220
to the predocs

669
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,899
um and you can mail him and you get an

670
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,760
account and you can play around with MGS

671
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,399
without unzipping a zip file if that's

672
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,200
too hard

673
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,539
well maybe in this audience it will you

674
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,940
will probably manage

675
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,100
um I did a research someday about the

676
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,820
mailing group how old are you guys and

677
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,059
it turned out they were on average 62

678
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,860
years old

679
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,340
so they're getting close to retirement

680
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,440
do you start to understand the

681
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,740
for-profit part of my title

682
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,140
or maybe I should explain it

683
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,419
I don't know

684
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,559
um

685
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,500
that there was this guy a boy 18 years

686
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,340
old who did a bid on eBay

687
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,380
344 dollars was all he had and he got

688
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,260
himself a Mainframe from a university

689
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,460
so uh he has a hilarious YouTube movie

690
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,919
uh clip about how he got all the stuff

691
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,960
with his dad's car from the University

692
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,600
to home and well he had to sort of

693
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,880
rebuild the basement without his parents

694
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,519
knowing to get the harder in and then

695
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
switch it on and the lights were a

696
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,720
little bit dimmed you know and then

697
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
working out how that thing worked

698
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,200
he got a job at IBM picupsi and pukupsi

699
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,880
is the place where they develop new

700
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,940
Mainframe Hardware so he really landed

701
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,760
his dream job simply by investing a

702
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,559
little bit and started to play around

703
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,720
with it and said hey you love Mainframe

704
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,240
why don't you come work for us oh by the

705
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,679
way this is not a pitch I'm not a

706
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,059
recorder

707
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,399
um I maybe should say that at the start

708
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,440
because every time you're oh I might not

709
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,940
be oh you want to work for us you know

710
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,179
the boring uh okay

711
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,500
um

712
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,980
so I was thinking oh this is fun

713
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,159
and I asked in a group does anybody have

714
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,700
an old original 30 to 70 terminal that I

715
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,380
can hook up to my laptop

716
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,960
and some very nice guy from Amsterdam

717
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,679
said I'll hook you up I'll have to stop

718
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,620
that should have got me thinking

719
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,600
I'll have the stuff

720
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,399
anyway I went there

721
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,659
and he showed me a pile of stuff

722
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,679
all this to get this terminal working on

723
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,799
this simple Dell PC and there's even a

724
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,240
component missing because I didn't have

725
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,539
it at that time but this one has a coax

726
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,120
cable that goes to a concentrator where

727
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,039
the configuration is in five and a

728
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,220
quarter floppy drives

729
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,519
that goes to a hdlc modem cables stuff

730
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,179
thing that I don't use but there isn't

731
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,460
an extra insert that you can do an

732
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,679
optional insert for either Ethernet or

733
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
token ring and ethernet is very

734
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,260
expensive and very rare so you end up

735
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,659
with token ring which means that you

736
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,880
you'll exit on the back of this with

737
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,640
token ring to a token ring hope that you

738
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,620
just have to got laying around of course

739
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,500
as one does

740
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,539
and then you go to a Cisco router where

741
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,000
that does understand token ring and

742
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,220
understands ethernet to get to ethernet

743
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,039
to your PC

744
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,220
um so that's all here on the back of

745
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,159
coax

746
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,580
connections and anyway and that's

747
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,740
supposedly works

748
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,320
which yeah yeah you said that the first

749
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,480
time no no I'm not going to die I don't

750
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,659
get uh nice joke

751
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,760
um and um

752
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,299
now there's this guy Andrew K and he

753
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,519
started thinking about they said playing

754
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,580
with it and he did a reverse engineering

755
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,880
of the 3270 protocol because it was not

756
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,880
documented outside of IBM

757
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,640
and he start making hardware and the

758
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,760
first Hardware he made was

759
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,320
um was this

760
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,060
yeah this board

761
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,000
where you should go this is coax in and

762
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
this USB out and you have to go to eBay

763
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,879
to get pretty rare and they're not more

764
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,379
in production but you can find them on

765
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,820
eBay two chips

766
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,300
and and buy them for 15 Euros or so 15

767
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,579
Euros or something

768
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,280
um and then you can connect that and

769
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
it's it's smaller than this pile of

770
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,440
hardware and but he was not satisfied

771
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,000
because well you know you have to get

772
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,460
these old ships and there's no future in

773
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,980
all chips so you started designing again

774
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,980
and he made this board and this is a

775
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,300
coax block

776
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,599
which means it's a very small board and

777
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,820
he put an fpga on it and Arduino control

778
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,560
on it and then started hacking and

779
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,139
coding and that works

780
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,280
um which in is is I I totally respect

781
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,180
that that's to me that's wow you know

782
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,460
um now if you only want the experience

783
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,920
of an old terminal simply install the

784
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,220
cool retro term uh software package and

785
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,020
you can have an application window that

786
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,420
looks like an old monitor even if you

787
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,839
like with with with the the the

788
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,540
the sync problems coming down the screen

789
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,520
if you like

790
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,579
um okay during preparation and giving

791
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,780
this talk I I met a few new friends

792
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,820
um a lot of guys in the s390 because

793
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,160
there's a very helpful bunch of people

794
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,339
if you're a lot if you like to learn

795
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,260
more about it join this mailing group

796
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,500
start asking your questions uh they are

797
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,619
getting like I said near to retirement

798
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,200
and they love young people to to get

799
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,020
younger people

800
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,960
to become interested in in this moshiba

801
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
of the most YouTube channel is based in

802
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,240
Texas a very nice guy always ready to

803
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,060
answer stuff uh Sam Gallop well Sam

804
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,540
Gallop is the maintainer of the CBT tape

805
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,380
and that's a distribution of tools

806
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,540
so it's a distro basically it's a

807
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,220
maintainer of a distro if you're into

808
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,099
Linux and this is just a computer tape

809
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,660
with a lot of tools and everybody knows

810
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,640
a CBT tape and it downloads them and

811
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,460
install tools and that's what what he

812
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,940
maintains uh We've even got a a an

813
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,800
analysis a couple of really nice

814
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
Mainframe guys raw Prince makes a an

815
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,079
editor uh RPF uh does also a very nice

816
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,380
update on TurnKey four that you can

817
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
download at this place

818
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,119
uh we have a guy from groning I forgot

819
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,160
his name I forgot to put it on there but

820
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,160
he did a free XA initiative why because

821
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,400
mvs at that time had a maximum memory of

822
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,220
16 megabyte so you can't address more in

823
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,839
mvs and 16 megabytes and he uh put up a

824
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,579
poll and asked for a lot of signatures

825
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,400
and then asked IBM can you please

826
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,200
release into the open source doesn't

827
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,300
have to be uh the source called binary

828
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,260
is fine as well the mvs xxa which was a

829
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,700
successor to MVA fvs which uh in which

830
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,560
you can address two gigabytes of memory

831
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,180
which would be nice you can do more

832
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,800
stuff with it and I believe that it's

833
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,680
got TCP built in

834
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,099
um and he got some 300 signatures but

835
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,960
IBM declined unfortunately so IBM please

836
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,160
don't be a jerk give us the stuff right

837
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,980
um mainframes today why would you use a

838
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,839
Mainframe well it's fully encrypted

839
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,859
everything it's got security

840
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,660
unparalleled transactions per second per

841
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,579
computer units and amazing mean time

842
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,220
between failures this thing is as stable

843
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,540
as a rock

844
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,760
uh and that's one of the reasons why

845
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
people buy mainframes

846
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,560
um there's a very nice uh YouTube clip

847
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,660
where he says I try to break a million

848
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,220
dollar computer well

849
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,640
yeah the price is about right but it's

850
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,339
it it shows you the Technologies

851
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,520
involved in the latest Mainframe

852
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,579
um

853
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,520
uh release cycle the Z16 and what

854
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,300
because it's got it starts at 128 cores

855
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,940
in a CPU but every core has

856
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,020
also got an AI chip next to it

857
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,619
so it's really for also developing

858
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,079
really new interesting

859
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,720
um uh functionality

860
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,420
in conclusion I think it's a wonderful

861
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,180
new world and it's for fun and could be

862
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,740
for profit

863
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,400
any questions

864
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:56,110
[Applause]

865
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,220
if anyone does have any questions can

866
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,339
you um uh line up behind the microphones

867
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,260
so that we can hear loud and clear what

868
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,640
the question is

869
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,060
um and uh signal Angel do we have any

870
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,740
questions from the internet no questions

871
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,619
uh from the internet at the moment

872
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,480
um okay

873
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,339
um

874
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:21,680
ah we have a question fantastic yay

875
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,720
it's kind of a question

876
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,740
um sure

877
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,839
I'm ancient I'm about this the average

878
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,040
age of your yeah me too by now yeah

879
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,640
um go us yeah exactly but when you keep

880
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,680
when you say Mainframe are you are you

881
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,339
referring solely to IBM uh at the moment

882
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,020
well I'm not an expert but at the moment

883
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,940
I believe they're the sole supplier of

884
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,160
Mainframe software in the world that

885
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,440
could be um because when I when I was a

886
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,760
child I'm pretty sure they weren't the

887
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,680
only ones yeah they were more so it

888
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,540
would be handy if you yeah it would just

889
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,820
be handy if you said that but I really

890
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,560
enjoyed the talk it was great oh thank

891
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,359
you very much thanks for the question

892
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,880
next

893
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,920
hi thanks for the talk

894
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,400
um how similar is uh the development

895
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,240
environment that you showed the TK4 to

896
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,200
an actual current IBM Mainframe uh in a

897
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,660
way it's very similar because the GUI is

898
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,359
still very much similar of course there

899
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,060
are much more features involved these

900
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,839
days uh database technology has evolved

901
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,960
uh transactional GUI kicks has evolved

902
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,880
uh uh of course encryption has evolved

903
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,560
they also cross-compile a lot of Open

904
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,300
Source tools uh to Mainframe uh there

905
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,500
are some who say look we can virtualize

906
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,660
everything on a Mainframe so you get one

907
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,180
Mainframe where you have 30 000

908
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,180
instances of Linux doing web stuff

909
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,000
yeah that's possible if you've got a

910
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,400
system like that laying around

911
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,119
um

912
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,339
uh what I also see is a lot of

913
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:05,040
organization who have a Mainframe stay

914
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,599
with the Mainframe and one of the

915
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,440
reasons is that IBM makes sure that the

916
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,780
cost of upgrading a Mainframe is less

917
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,880
than porting the software to a new

918
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,339
platform

919
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,480
um

920
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,119
so they really make sure that there's a

921
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,160
business case where you can only say oh

922
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,660
let's upgrade the system because it's

923
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,760
cheaper than porting everything to a new

924
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,460
platform

925
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,319
I'm also an Australia fan I've got a

926
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:32,640
collection of about seven of those

927
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,579
devices and it's it's a mid-range it's a

928
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,160
it's it's much more focused Hardware on

929
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,599
throughput than the regular x86 standard

930
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,540
sort of

931
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,640
Hardware layout

932
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,619
and and my other question is the other

933
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,839
way around so

934
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,359
um is there any chance that uh a

935
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,000
customer that has a Mainframe uh moves

936
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,880
their software onto a system like this

937
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,880
ah well maybe it will just surprise you

938
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,060
but there is an extension to vs code

939
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,500
where you can connect to your Mainframe

940
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,900
and code in vs code and and and

941
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,599
synchronize and submit jobs on the

942
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,980
Mainframe

943
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,160
so yeah they did evolve from that area

944
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,579
you don't have to constantly use this uh

945
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,920
pretty archaic user interface there are

946
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,859
lots of tools on the outside

947
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,900
uh there's things like every

948
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,480
organization needs his own design of a

949
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,839
report so they also report engine design

950
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,160
stuff that you do in Windows or whatever

951
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,960
sorry and

952
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,760
um that you Deploy on the Mainframe and

953
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,339
there you generate and re and and yeah

954
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,940
print the reprint reports yeah

955
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,880
okay thanks next question

956
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,560
thanks for the talk

957
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
um I just wanted to let you know if you

958
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,220
are an IBM partner then you can have a

959
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,040
hard disk which has the newest setos

960
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,940
version on it as a way to develop

961
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,579
uh well yeah they they do while they do

962
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,000
sell the gpdt personal development Tool

963
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,839
uh I believe it's about 8 000 Euros and

964
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,460
then you don't have a Mainframe but you

965
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,060
have a sort of a dedicated big PC

966
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,180
um but 8 000 is a little bit out of my

967
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,200
uh budget range so yeah but they do

968
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,300
um also Supply them to schools and

969
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,160
universities where our school or

970
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,720
university will say well that will give

971
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,740
us a chance to train students in in Z OS

972
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,460
which is of course the the current OS of

973
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,160
of Mainframe of IBM mainframes

974
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,740
um and then they'll find a job in in

975
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,780
that area of course

976
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,640
you're welcome thanks for the question

977
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,460
and uh to final check any questions from

978
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,740
the internet

979
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,740
no more questions okay so I think if

980
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,240
that's that's it if there's no more

981
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,280
questions let's thank our speaker for an

982
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,950
awesome talk thank you

983
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:09,549
[Applause]
