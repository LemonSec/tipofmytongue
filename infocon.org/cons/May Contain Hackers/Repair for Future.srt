1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,640
um i had originally uh suggested we do

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
some kind of talk or panel with

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,359
involving everyone and sharing

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,960
experiences

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
but it's kind of difficult on a stage

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
like this so

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
i'm just going to present my slides

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
which i had prepared anyway

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,719
and

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
i'll invite you all

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
to our village afterwards for a

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,399
discussion whoever wants to talk about

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
details of certain repairs or exchanging

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
exchanging any uh

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
ideas for repair cafes and stuff like

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
that

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,920

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,840

from germany

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
i'm developing software in my day job

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
and i founded a repair cafe in

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
the hometown

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
uh schaffenberg of mine

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,079
um

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
i'm a member of our makerspace

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
schaffenburg ifau

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
there's also a company called

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
schuffenberg in the netherlands and they

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,759
make office furniture but we're not

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
affiliated

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
also we're not sponsored sadly

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,200
i'm giving tips in a live tv show in

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
germany's rd

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
every once in a while

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
and i founded another repair cafe in my

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
home village just a few months ago

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
so

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
somebody once said in a way everybody is

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
a hacker everyone has their tricks to

46
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,520
deal with technology in everyday life

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
and

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
that person was

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,480
about holland

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
it's german

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
yeah so what he basically says it is

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,959
hacking to deal with technology and

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
problems in your everyday life

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,400
so

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
everybody has heard the word life hack

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
that's pretty much uh the gist of it i

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
think

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
and that's why i i do these talks at

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
hacker conferences and camps like this

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
because i think uh there's just uh such

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
such a

62
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,120
yeah a closeness in mindsets

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
that we should really work together

64
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
like this uh

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
yeah let's see there's another slide

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
and of course i brought some motivation

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,879
this is a photo from today my friend

68
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
woke up this morning laying on the

69
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,599
ground because his airbed

70
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,879
was

71
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
leaking and all the air leaked out so we

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,720
had to fix it

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,080
of course i had patches and pvc

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,200
glue

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
and we could repair it yesterday our

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,480
crep maker in the village broke the

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
switch broke it is a

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
a spare part that would cost like 2

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
euros or 50 cents

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
um but the regular consumer would have

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
to throw the thing away it's out of

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,720
warranty uh it has special screws that

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
you can't open without um

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
a special tool set

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
what should you do

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
usually it would be throwing it away we

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,680
just

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
shorted the switch and we can use it

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
again

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,239
so who hasn't heard what a repair cafe

91
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,920
is

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
okay i will explain

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
so a repair cafe

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,839
is um a kind of meeting

95
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,639
where

96
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
volunteers like me

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,400
go and help

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
people seeking help

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
trying to repair something and can do it

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
themselves and show them to help

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,600
themselves

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
so

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
it is a kind of repairing together

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,000
socially

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
and

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,160
it is of course meant for helping people

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,199
who may be unable to afford replacing or

108
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
something and of course it's also there

109
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,800
to stop people from just throwing it

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
away if it's easy to repair and

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
replacing it with with a new uh bot item

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,919
to save resources and keep it out of

113
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
landfill

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
and

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,039
just

116
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,759
some 40 50 kilometers

117
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
west from here in amsterdam was the

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,520
first organized repair cafe

119
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
in 2009

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,600
where

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
yeah where she pretty much formalized

122
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
this as an event so people have always

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
helped each other in neighborhoods and

124
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
and

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
yeah and help each other other repair

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
stuff but

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
the way our society works today is that

128
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,680
people aren't so close with with their

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
neighborhoods anymore and stuff like

130
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
that so

131
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
it wasn't easy finding somebody who's

132
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
not a professional

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,199
to repair things and even

134
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,080
even

135
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
for professional repairs it's hard

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,039
usually people get told no we can fix

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
that toaster that doesn't make any sense

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,680
we the time it takes us to open it is

139
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
more than a new toaster would cost

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
so what we do at a repair cafe is a lot

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
of times is tending to those

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
uh

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,880
products that aren't really worth much

144
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
anymore anyway and people would just

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
throw them out without really thinking

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
much about it of course sometimes it's a

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
flat tv that is just out of warranty and

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
maybe cost a thousand euros and it's

149
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
just a tiny little diode for 50 cents

150
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
that blew

151
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,759
we've seen that before too

152
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
yeah so anyway um it was martin postma

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,479
from amsterdam who formalized this and

154
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,720
founded the schtichting repair cafe

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
in 2010

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
and they have

157
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
this uh starter set which works kind of

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
like a franchise with a squiggly logo

159
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
which has changed by now it's not quite

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
as squiggly anymore

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,960
not much prettier either though and

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
and um

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
it's it's very uh successful so there

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
are hundreds of repair coffees around

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,319
the world if not thousands uh hundreds

166
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
in germany alone and um big cities have

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
multiple ones

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
um

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
some work

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,080
all days of the week

171
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
it's uh yeah it's become a real movement

172
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,759
so there are other um how should i call

173
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,080
it it's not really organizations

174
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680

out of which

186
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
they probably aren't all active anymore

187
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
maybe some of them were a one-time thing

188
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
or so but it's a couple of hundred and

189
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
it's really amazing and

190
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,879
uh

191
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120

with their devices and and they really

200
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,840
have professionals uh that do

201
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
that do this as a full-time job like you

202
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,879
would repair would expect or would have

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
expected back in the good days from your

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
tv

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
uh sales person in

next door

207
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,719
and

208
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
yeah of course internationally and

209
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,839
strongly in the united states there is

210
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,440
ifixit founded by kyle wiens

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
and they have a big online community

212
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,640
with

213
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
many repair manuals

214
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
and they're also strongly lobbying for

215
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
the right to repair movement

216
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
in the united states and of course

217
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,399
there's also ifixit in

218
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,560
in the european union based in germany

219
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
so how does a typical day at a repair

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
event look like this is our logo from

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
aschaffenburg we

222
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,760
uh

223
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,480
tried incorporating all the the

224
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
different

225
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
things that we do like

226
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,279
sewing

227
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,560
and

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
electronics uh woodwork

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,720
bicycles mechanical stuff what not into

230
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
that

231
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
and

232
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
the the model is uh we can fix it

233
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
together pretty much

234
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
so we have these little

235
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,519
slips of paper that people write their

236
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
names

237
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
in and what they brought

238
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
so

239
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
a toaster and what the defect is it

240
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
doesn't heat anymore or it doesn't stay

241
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
down we try to uh

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
to ask them at the entrance um

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
what the exact problem is because

244
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
otherwise people will just write doesn't

245
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,079
work

246
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,800
and it helps the repair people

247
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
if they have a slight idea of what's

248
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
going on

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
and of course on the other side there's

250
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
the house rules

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
which

252
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
boil down to say

253
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,640
uh

254
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
if if it if it breaks for good while

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
trying to fix it then yeah it's bad luck

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,560
things like that

257
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,519
and then

258
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
our repair helpers take the

259
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,399
take the slips of paper off of the

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,800
blackboard and then ask the people to

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,279
come to their desk and then they start

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
fixing it together

263
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
the repair helpers bring their own

264
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
toolboxes the stuff that they're uh used

265
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
to what they can work with well like

266
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,959
their own multimeters and

267
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
whatever screwdrivers or not soldering

268
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
irons

269
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,600
sewing machines

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
glue stuff like that

271
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,920
and then

272
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
usually there's food

273
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,640
like the

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
name repair cafe already implies

275
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
of course uh by the way there aren't all

276
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,120
called repair cafe that is just yeah

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
the sticking repair cafe expects them to

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
be named repair cafe but you could just

279
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
as well call it a

280
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
repair initiative or

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,800
cafe caput or something like that

282
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
there's there are so many creative names

283
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,839
for them

284
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,040
yeah and

285
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
we start with coffee and cake as well

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
and

287
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
sometimes we also cook it depends on

288
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
where we do our

289
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,640
event

290
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
we always change locations after each

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
look each event

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
and

293
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
sometimes the people there prepare like

294
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
in this case it is

295
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
some turkish food

296
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
yeah we've got usually got some bicycle

297
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,639
repairs going on

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
and yeah

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,760
fixing clothes or

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
dolls or toys

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
all different things so

302
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
people bring the funniest stuff last

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
time somebody brought a

304
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
a pool

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
cleaning robot

306
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
something that crawls over a floor of a

307
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
pool

308
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
yeah and then yeah we ha all have set up

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
our little tables with um

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,839
like here billy is is fixing some

311
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,120
blender or i don't know what and

312
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
there's somebody fixing something else

313
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,839
and yeah people sit together with the

314
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
repair helper and they watch and they

315
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
if they can they'll hold something or

316
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
unscrew it themselves and sometimes

317
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
people will even

318
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
do it all by themselves that they just

319
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,638
need a little hint every once in a while

320
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,839
this is the city major at the first

321
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,320
event um and that is me eight years ago

322
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,040
or something fixing the

323
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
the kitchen

324
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,920
machine of his wife

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
okay and

326
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
yeah sometimes like cd players or hi-fi

327
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,320
devices uh especially like tube devices

328
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
are really time consuming to repair and

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
have to be a lot of measurements done

330
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
and we need a lot of spare parts and

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,000
then that goes out of scope and time

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
range of what we can do in a repair cafe

333
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
and then sometimes people

334
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
uh like take them home privately and

335
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,920
continue it there

336
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,719
inofficially

337
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
yeah so

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,279
um maybe you remember

339
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
luckily it's all over now but there was

340
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
a pandemic

341
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
and it kind of hit the repair cafes as

342
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,600
well

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
there was a lockdown in in germany i

344
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
think here in in the netherlands as well

345
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,519
at some point and we couldn't do

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
anything anymore we were very uh

347
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,399
unprepared for it and uh so many um

348
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
appointments were just cancelled

349
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,399
but um

350
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
for example repair cafe aschaffenburg

351
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
started

352
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,800
already a month or something into the

353
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
pandemic

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
into experimenting with uh remote

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,199
services so we would offer a um

356
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,079
a jitsi instance where people

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
uh could log in during the uh

358
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
the time that was uh scheduled for uh

359
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,399
for a repair cafe we always do that once

360
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
a month at a saturday

361
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,079
and we had

362
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,440
leaflets printed so the appointments

363
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
were already known and instead of just

364
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
canceling them all together instead we

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
did it online on our jitsi instance

366
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
um i'll show a little bit in another in

367
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
in the next slide how how that could

368
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,519
work

369
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,639
and then

370
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
after the lockdown we did

371
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,000
the

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,160
the events offline

373
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
with additional hygiene measures like uh

374
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
disinfection and

375
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,680
social distancing and a limited amount

376
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,760
of guests that had to pre-book

377
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
this is just a list of different repair

378
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,480
cafes

379
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
doing online

380
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
events just like

381
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,120
we did and

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
something that is

383
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
noteworthy

384
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
especially at these kind of conferences

385
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
is that most of them used open

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,720
um

387
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,160
open solutions for the video

388
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
conferencing like a lot of them use big

389
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,839
blue button or jitsi

390
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
and um just a few a few of them use

391
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
proprietary stuff like zoom

392
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,040
or

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
microsoft teams

394
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,439
some of them were even provided by

395
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,519
makerspaces yeah so how can online

396
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,040
repairing work

397
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
this was during our first

398
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
online repair session and there's a a

399
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
guest and she

400
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,600
was trying to fix a video projector

401
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
and

402
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
we helped her

403
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,079
disassemble the case which is always

404
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
very hard

405
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,000
even if you have it on your table in

406
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,320
front of you but if you have to

407
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,759
um

408
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,240
if you have to remotely

409
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
tell a layman or a lay person how to to

410
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,519
open something like that up then it's

411
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,680
really difficult you can you can see

412
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,920
it's an electronic device so it has

413
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
mains voltage in it of course we

414
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
unplugged it all and it was basically

415
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
just diagnostics

416
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
um

417
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
but

418
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
we could tell that this uh

419
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,920
this this one power regulator had blown

420
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,679
and um

421
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,160
she was even able like you can you can

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
see here's a part of it yeah

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,679
after like trying to get it open for an

424
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
hour and a half or something she saw

425
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
that this part are blown and we were

426
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
able to uh order

427
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,280
the

428
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
spare part and then during a later time

429
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,959
when she came into the repair cafe we

430
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,760
could solder it and switch it and repair

431
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,559
it that way this would have been usually

432
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
something where a person would have to

433
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,520
come to the repair cafe twice because of

434
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,320
course we can't have all special parts

435
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,879
on stock

436
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,919
yeah with a video resolution especially

437
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,520
with webrtc

438
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,559
uh the um

439
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
the the the inscriptions on the parts

440
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
are of course not readable

441
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
so um

442
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
some of the repair initiatives they

443
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,120
started using out-of-band

444
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
high-res photography for

445
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
those kind of

446
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
diagnostics instead

447
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,720
but what is cool is that you can open a

448
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,600
repair manual and then show her where

449
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
the clips are and

450
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,320
things like that or if a person has a

451
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
computer problems you can

452
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,240
help them like with a team viewer or

453
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
something

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
um yeah then after the

455
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
these experiments of the separate

456
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
initiatives there was um a bundled

457
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
approach by the network

458
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
uh laboratory initiative for basically

459
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
all of germany

460
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
were helpers from the different

461
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
initiatives uh could log in

462
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,960
and then uh help guests

463
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,330
um

464
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,960
[Music]

465
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,840
and that was uh a week in um february

466
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,760
2021 where we did that for every every

467
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
evening and

468
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,559
afterwards uh we did it once per month

469
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
and in the beginning we had

470
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,919
quite

471
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
some

472
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
guests like in march there were 40

473
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,880
guests and over 20 helpers and 10

474
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
repairs all together

475
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
some people just wanted to to check in

476
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,039
and see how it could work

477
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,160
but that

478
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,440
steadily

479
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
uh went down the hill so in the end

480
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
there were only repairs repairers but no

481
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
guests uh trying to get anything fixed

482
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
so we turned it into more something like

483
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,720
a

484
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
a monthly meet up of the repair

485
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
community

486
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
because this uh network repair

487
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,640
initiatives also did um

488
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,840
like meetups of in the different regions

489
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,960
of germany and uh um

490
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,360
like a federal uh for for the whole

491
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,400
country

492
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
uh once a year and that couldn't take

493
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,679
place

494
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,480
either which was very sad because uh

495
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,760
repairers really need to repair like i

496
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,080
know it for myself if we can't repair

497
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,760
something then we get

498
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,360
yeah

499
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
so we were always waiting for guests i

500
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,600
could have

501
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,559
um

502
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,440
good

503
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
so

504
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,799
why do we even have to do this

505
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,159
the problem is

506
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
um that in europe alone this is the

507
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,799
number from

508
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,960
two years ago i think or last year when

509
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,520
when was that with that giant ship being

510
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,480
stuck in the in that canal

511
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
it was last year yeah so

512
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
imagine 60 of those giant things filled

513
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,520
all the way with waste with electric

514
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
waste this is what europe alone produces

515
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
every year this is it's unimaginable

516
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
it's 20 kilos per person per year

517
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
and

518
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
we want to basically be

519
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,640
an impulse and and give give people yeah

520
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
a way of changing their their thinking

521
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,880
and the way they consume

522
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
especially electronics but also

523
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
clothes and textiles

524
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
and um we're trying to kind of kick off

525
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,840
a political process too

526
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
so there is already

527
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,280
the

528
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,000
european eco design directive

529
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
which

530
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,640
for example has brought us

531
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
leds

532
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
as light bulb replacements or

533
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,080
vacuum cleaners that have a

534
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,799
limited wattage

535
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,400
stuff like that so

536
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
some of those things are very very good

537
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
and there is also since last year an

538
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
amendment to the echo design directive

539
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,000
that is supposed to

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
improve a right to repair so in the

541
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
first step this applied to just a few

542
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,559
products or

543
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,799
product ranges like

544
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,039
coolers washing machines

545
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,320
dishwashers and displays so televisions

546
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
mainly

547
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
and

548
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
it requires them to be

549
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,720
repairable without special tools or at

550
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
least the cases should should be

551
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,520
openable

552
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,960
without special tools and that uh spare

553
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,080
parts need to be supplied for a few

554
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,120
years so it's i think it's seven years

555
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
for the displays and ten years for the

556
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
um for the appliances

557
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,960
and um repairing and service manuals

558
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
need to be supplied

559
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
so this is already in effect as of last

560
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
year

561
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
yes

562
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
the question was

563
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
spare parts how does it work out in

564
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
practice

565
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
um

566
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,039
so in practice the rule is they need to

567
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,320
be supplied within or provided within 15

568
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
days for professional repairers

569
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
and there is no rule for the price of

570
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
them either

571
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
uh yeah unluckily and

572
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,480
also

573
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,240
there is no rule that keeps

574
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,600
manufacturers from from bundling um

575
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,039
spare parts into giant modules

576
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,679
like uh

577
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
the rule doesn't tell them only to

578
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
supply or provide the bearing of a

579
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,280
washing machine drum it can be the whole

580
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,240
drum

581
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
including a bearing that can't be

582
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
changed so this is not perfect yet

583
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,840
is this what your question was about

584
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
yeah thank you very good question

585
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
um

586
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
so what's going on this year in 2022 is

587
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,960
that our um europe european parliament

588
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
has voted for

589
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
uh right to repair

590
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,279
on april 7th and

591
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,679
um that means that the european

592
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,640
commission has to or should come up with

593
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
a uh with an amendment to the directive

594
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,720
in

595
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,279
uh this fall 2022

596
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
and

597
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,039
so the idea is that there should be

598
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,159
incentive for repairs that could be for

599
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,279
example

600
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,159
uh

601
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
tax reductions or

602
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
some kind of

603
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,760
um

604
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,440
the vouchers

605
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,919
like uh austria already has this in

606
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
place when you

607
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
when you go there and you get your

608
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
washing machine

609
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
fixed and it costs 200 for labor and

610
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,200
spare parts 200 euro then the austrian

611
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,880
government will pay 50 of that back so

612
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
you only have to pay 100.

613
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,559
this is really cool

614
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,200
does the german state of uh thrinia has

615
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,640
that too now but only a limited uh

616
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
budget i think

617
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,440
yeah

618
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
and um

619
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
of course the

620
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,000
service manuals and software updates uh

621
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
have to be provided

622
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
for a certain period

623
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
for a broader range of products

624
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
and yeah and the rest is

625
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
[Music]

626
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
it's it's not very very

627
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,679
concrete but devices should be more

628
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,640
robust and easier to repair and

629
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
wear parts should be easy to replace

630
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
this is always a question of definition

631
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
but it's

632
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
it's a start

633
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,440
so another good thing is that consumer

634
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
information about repairability should

635
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,200
be improved and warranties extended

636
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,760
um best thing would be

637
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,559
in

638
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,159
in my mind

639
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,360
you buy a washing machine that

640
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,480
is projected for a 10-year lifetime

641
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
and then you have a warranty for 10

642
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
years that would be the best thing then

643
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,679
people can choose do i want the 300 euro

644
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,840
machine that has a two-year lifetime or

645
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
do i want a thousand euro machine that

646
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
has a 10 year life man the if you do the

647
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,440
math then it's easy which one is the

648
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
the better choice huh

649
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,080
okay um

650
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
another thing is that is technically

651
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,799
already illegal but

652
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,279
it would be really illegal then these

653
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,760
are practices leading to worse or worse

654
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
in repair abilities that planned

655
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
obsolescence should be banned

656
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,880
so if i put a little fuse in that breaks

657
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
after

658
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,159
two years or after the warranty is over

659
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,360
then

660
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
it would definitely be illegal yeah it

661
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
hasn't

662
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,600
exactly been proven in before a court i

663
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,200
think that

664
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
some manufacturers manufacturers put

665
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
these kinds of

666
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,320
things into devices but we all know that

667
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,760
they exist

668
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,240
like just think about printers which

669
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,159
stop working after the the little excess

670
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,039
ink sponge is full when they think it's

671
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,400
full

672
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,360
yeah

673
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,159
and um another thing that

674
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,360
should come is the digital product pass

675
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
with qr codes

676
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,679
that contains

677
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,480
extra information about

678
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,120
like energy consumption and

679
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,120
repairability things like that

680
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,279
i need a

681
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,000
simple order

682
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
so

683
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
friends

684
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
already has a repairability index

685
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
since last year for a couple of uh

686
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
products

687
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
um

688
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,520
and um this number uh shows uh pretty

689
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
much how difficult a product is to

690
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,159
repair

691
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,440
uh the bad thing is that the manufac

692
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
manufacturers calculate the score by

693
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,240
themselves and there are a few uh

694
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
categories uh like

695
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,399
um

696
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,679
the uh uh yeah manuals and stuff like

697
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,480
that

698
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,799
that can um

699
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
increase the score even though they

700
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,279
aren't really easy to repair for example

701
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,559
ifixit

702
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,480
has the 36 easy steps that you have to

703
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
do to switch a battery on a galaxy s21

704
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
and it still scores 8.2 which is

705
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,760
absolutely ridiculous

706
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,039
yeah in the united states

707
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,799
it is illegal that

708
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
uh companies all right it's not illegal

709
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
to put them on but they are null and

710
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
void you all know these uh warranty void

711
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
stickers on devices

712
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,159
since 1975 courts have ruled that yeah

713
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
they don't mean anything technically

714
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
and also it's very interesting that the

715
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
american rights to repair movement

716
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
got traction because of a

717
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
very conservative

718
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,799
groups of products uh group of products

719
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,000
uh it's tractors by john deere yeah they

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
put drm and stuff into their machines uh

721
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,080
that would um

722
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,240
keep farmers from repairing their

723
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,399
equipment on field

724
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,200
uh

725
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
imagine the tractor breaks they have to

726
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
do

727
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,679
they have to bring in the crops and yeah

728
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
you can't put it in the shop they have

729
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
to fix it on spot that wasn't possible

730
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
anymore and that was a real uproar and

731
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
attraction to the right to repair

732
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
movement

733
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
last year president biden assigned an

734
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,039
executive order empowering

735
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,840
um right to repair and

736
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
there have been a couple of state

737
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
legislations this year this the last one

738
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
being the fair repair act

739
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,279
of new york in june

740
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,159
um germany has the round

741
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,240
table for repairs

742
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
which does lobbying

743
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,279
and we

744
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,279
i'm a member of that too and we managed

745
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,880
to even get

746
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
right to repair into the coalition

747
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,960
contract of the governing parties

748
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,399
of this

749
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,960
legislation period in germany

750
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,159
and

751
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,640
like i've already mentioned turinga and

752
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,840
austria subsidize

753
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,919
repairs and just last week india has

754
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,640
announced that they also want to

755
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
introduce a right to repair law

756
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
so what can we do

757

sometimes sometimes

761
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,960

or when you're a member of a makerspace

784
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,559
why don't you offer some consultation

785
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,600
hours

786
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,559
in

787
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,960
your makerspace where people can come

788
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,360
with their devices or

789
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,039
volunteer

790
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,360
um

791
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
at a

792
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,799
at a repair event

793
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,200
yeah and last but not least if you live

794
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,039
in a rural area that doesn't have any

795
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,399
repair cafe yet you can always open one

796
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,600
there are

797
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
there's the stifting repair cafe for the

798
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
netherlands there are they are also

799
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,519
active all over europe and they have

800
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,159
their starters set

801
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,200
um it is worth it it uh

802
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
a british study so british studies show

803
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
everything

804
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
eventually what they have a study on it

805
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,000
but this one shows that repairing

806
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,240
actually has an impact on co2 reduction

807
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,919
and

808
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,200
it's

809
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
yeah it's about 1 to 10 kilo per

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,919
kilo of device repaired

811
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,880
um

812
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,679
yeah

813
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,240
what we personally can do as well is

814
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,559
think twice before buying stuff

815
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
especially gadgets especially

816
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,960
iot crap which may just as well stop

817
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
working next year when the manufacturer

818
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,039
decides to turn off the cloud

819
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,200
things like that do we really need it

820
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,720
yeah

821
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,399
cherish and

822
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,880
service and maintenance

823
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
loop your

824
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
loop your

825
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
bicycle chain and stuff like that

826
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
decalcify your coffee machine clean your

827
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,760
vacuum cleaner filters that will extend

828
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,600
their lifetime it's important

829
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,840
and

830
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,399
um

831
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,600
use a warranty to the end if something

832
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
is broken

833
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,360
uh within the warranty time

834
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
even if it's just the stupid led light

835
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,399
bulb then get it replaced

836
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,039
yeah it's impo that is it's something

837
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,159
that

838
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,320
yeah

839
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
yeah sometimes they even have an

840
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
extended warranty of like five years or

841
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
something but it's a it's a tedious

842
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,640
process people or the manufacturers try

843
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,239
to keep them

844
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,520
yeah keep them from from uh using that

845
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,480
and um of course another good thing is

846
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,679
teach kids how to solder and do making

847
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,480
classes soldering is a very important

848
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
repair technique

849
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,399
it is good if they know how to do it

850
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
upcycling

851
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,960
if a tv

852
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
main board is broken you can still use

853
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,839
the backlight for a really cool

854
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,320
shadow free desk glide

855
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
for example

856
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
there are a bunch of initiatives

857
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,239
there is a fix fest which is an

858
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,639
international repair conference

859
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,520
in

860
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,719
brussels

861
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,440
in september or end of september

862
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
beginning of october that first weekend

863
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,520

uh

868
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,359

last 10 years please

870
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,680
put it put a sticker on and then

871
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,359
actually extend the warranty to that

872
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,960
time

873
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,560
and uh what we need is a really a uh

874
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
europe-wide return system for functional

875
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,119
or easily repairable goods

876
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,280
um belgium has that with the

877
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
cringewinkel

878
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,040
you don't throw stuff away that you

879
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,640
don't need anymore you give it to

880
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,599
a central instance and then it's being

881
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
given out again for a really low price

882
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,359
of repaired

883
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,480
um

884
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
by by some welfare jobs and um

885
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,640
we have that in germany now for

886
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,520
uh

887
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,440
for people who have fled ukraine uh

888
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
and they're

889
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,440
taking old laptops and computers and

890
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
giving them away again to the refugees

891
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,760
after installing a free open source

892
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,240
operating system on them

893
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
yeah then of course some incentives for

894
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
repairs would be nice as i've mentioned

895
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,240
and also

896
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,359
please

897
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,200
always keep in mind regard the

898
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,560
ecological impact of every purchase and

899
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
social impact some people have to

900
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
assemble these things and those people

901
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,119
don't live good lives some people have

902
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,560
to dig out

903
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,960
tons of uh

904
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,760
stuff from the earth to make uh enough

905
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,800
uh

906
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,079
cobalt for for uh

907
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
for a phone or for a car or whatnot

908
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,280
please always consider that

909
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,160
and not only the production also this

910
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,960
the disposal is bad for our planet

911
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,880
yeah

912
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
eventually will become a degrowth

913
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,599
society if we want it or not

914
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,160
it is it would be better if we did it

915
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,400
voluntarily and be prepared for it

916

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
were some interesting questions and and

935
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
maybe yeah yeah let and let's get to the

936
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
microphone because

937
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,079
i i think we have a few more

938
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,000
yeah thanks for the very interesting

939
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
discussion uh and talk um i think what i

940
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
wanted to say is uh regarding

941
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,880
uh warranties i think

942
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
a lot of people aren't aware that the

943
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,599
european law states that you have two

944
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
years at least but it's at least so if

945
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
it's a washing machine it the law is a

946
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,760
bit vague unfortunately

947
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,560
but

948
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,000
i think it states something as uh as

949
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
much warranty as you should be

950
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,240
uh

951
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,560
um the lifespan should be yeah as the

952
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,760
life as you as you could meaningfully

953
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,720
expect the product to last which is

954
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,520
vague yes really helps the manufacturers

955
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
to uh

956
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,160
yeah get out of uh warranty claims

957
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,680
yeah if we had

958
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,880
if we really had a compulsory label

959
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,599
where the manufacturer has to write the

960
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,960
projected lifetime of a product on uh on

961
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,599
the packing then people would be able to

962
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,680
to choose and and really claim that

963
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,040
right yes yeah that warranty yeah

964
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,280
but that's not in the proposals yet it

965
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,160
is oh right yeah okay um

966
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,119
yeah

967
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,920
it isn't in the proposal that uh the

968
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,960
lifetime has to be written on and the

969
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,440
warranty has to be according

970
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
that is not like that yeah unluckily

971
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,359
okay but we're trying to push it that

972
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,480
way

973
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
keep pushing keep pushing every great

974
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,680
and the second question of uh uh i don't

975
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
see anything anyone queuing up yet so

976
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,240
yeah

977
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,839
i attended a few uh repair cafes

978
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
around the holland and i noticed the

979
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,640
atmosphere was sometimes

980
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,400
quite uh

981
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,520
of the participants i mean um more kind

982
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,839
of like they brought their product

983
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,040
dumped it

984
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
and sometimes even went out they weren't

985
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
really

986
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,440
invested or really paying attention yeah

987
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,400
do you have any tips maybe for uh

988
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,319
how to to get the right kind of

989
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,560
engagement let's say um

990
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,400
so we've seen that too that people were

991
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,720
like misunderstanding the concept of a

992
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
repair cafe as like a professional

993
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,800
repair shop for your

994
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,200
professionally even free repair shop and

995
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,079
uh we always made clear that

996
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,280
um

997
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,240
we're here on our free time and then we

998
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
want people to understand and to help

999
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,319
and at least watch

1000
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,560
if they don't have to

1001
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,200
to manually help um

1002
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,520
but um i think it's uh

1003
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,079
probably about communication like

1004
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,160
writing an article about what you do in

1005
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,200
your local newspaper with photos and

1006
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
stuff like that that always helps and we

1007
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
rarely get that so

1008
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,800
maybe

1009
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,119
once or twice a year

1010
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,400
yeah

1011
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,920
that's better

1012
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,319
good to hear thank you there's a few

1013
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,720
people lining up so let's bring it on

1014
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
hey um i often find myself in

1015
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,440
discussions with like uh companies that

1016
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
i buy products from and they claim to be

1017
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,200
very uh you know

1018
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,599
lifetime products and then uh something

1019
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,359
breaks and then they're like okay we'll

1020
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,119
send you like a new one and i'm like no

1021
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,800
i i don't want a new one i want you to

1022
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
repair and a lot of times i also

1023
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
sort of offer them

1024
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,800
clues for like how they could like send

1025
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,880
repair kits to all of the people who

1026
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,640
have this broken and

1027
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,000
i don't know these are companies like

1028
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,079
for example reigns you know the rain

1029
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,640
jacket from denmark or gregory from like

1030
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,560
backpacks or stanley

1031
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,720
and it's always like very i never get to

1032
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
like a good solution um i just kind of

1033
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,440
want to create awareness for them to

1034
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
repair the stuff instead so i guess none

1035
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,280
of the laws apply here but do you have

1036
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,400
maybe any

1037
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,319
tips of like how to communicate i think

1038
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,760
it's also mostly i communicate with a

1039
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,680
person who's not actually able to and i

1040
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,800
don't get

1041
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,920
to

1042
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
anyone who can influence that yeah so

1043
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,760
yeah the that law is not in place yet

1044
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,720
but it's it's also supposed to be for

1045
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,760
bitten to uh throw away

1046
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,119
um

1047
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,839
like new stock or just uh slightly

1048
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,280
defective and repairable stuff

1049
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,200
but the problem is that

1050
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,119
that products aren't designed to be

1051
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,599
repairable anymore like a lot of times

1052
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,160
you can't even open a case of a product

1053
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,720
without destroying it or

1054
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,400
shoes or

1055
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
backpacks like you mentioned they are

1056
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,599
all glued together they can't be soon or

1057
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,880
anything and if they fail then they then

1058
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
sometimes they do fail for good and they

1059
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,480
need to be replaced because even the

1060
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,119
manufacturer can't fix it

1061
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,480
but in these cases i actually fix it

1062
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,319
myself i mean the thing with the range

1063
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,599
but okay

1064
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,599
yeah i want them to do it and i wanted

1065
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,200
to also do it for other other people i

1066
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,880
mean yeah

1067
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,960
they were totally fixable actually yeah

1068
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,640
i mean maybe they would have been could

1069
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
have been designed better but but they

1070
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
may not even have the facilities anymore

1071
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,480
yeah

1072
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,440
thank you yeah thank you

1073
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,839
and indeed i think i i i see the problem

1074
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,480
that you wanted to repair it and yeah

1075
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
you get a new one most people are happy

1076
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
about it yeah but

1077
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,440
yes but

1078
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
it's not the same thing

1079
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,200
it doesn't make sense

1080
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,079
hi there thank you very much i was

1081
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,079
i was

1082
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,560
i was vaguely familiar with uh some of

1083
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,240
these uh movements initiatives in europe

1084
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,119
uh

1085
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,680
very pleased to learn more about it

1086
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,319
fascinating uh excellent stuff

1087
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,760
now uh from what i've seen it seems to

1088
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,400
me like the place that would be the most

1089
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,560
i don't know if i can say advanced but

1090
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,520
that has the strongest culture of repair

1091
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,720
like that

1092
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,680
and uh unfortunately not necessarily out

1093
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,760
of uh such uh

1094
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,079
noble motivations but more out of

1095
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,520
necessity

1096
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,200
is cuba

1097
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,520
it seems to me like cuba is the fix it

1098
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
country yeah uh i was wondering if

1099
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,839
there's been any uh formal or informal

1100
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,119
some kind of uh

1101
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,280
exchange with the

1102
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
cuban repairers or if uh yeah

1103
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
thank you not that i'm aware of that's

1104
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,440
an excellent question and

1105
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,599
let me bring this up if you look on a

1106
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,000
map for repair initiatives

1107
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,359
then imagine the iron curtain they

1108
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,000
almost stop there so east of uh like

1109
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,200
germany poland is all also already very

1110
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,240
sparse

1111
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,880
people there don't need repair cafes

1112
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
because they can still do it they can

1113
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,680
still do it themselves and they do like

1114
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,839
i was in in romania a couple of years

1115
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,800
ago in a very uh remote town of sulina

1116
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,520
their next hardware shop was

1117
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,880
uh two hours by ship

1118
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
there aren't even any roads there people

1119
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,960
need to be able to fix them

1120
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,040
their stuff on their own with and

1121
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,839
improvise and they do yeah they don't

1122
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,240
need repair cafes and cuba is probably

1123
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,079
the same way thank you for this

1124
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,520
suggestion

1125
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
thank you

1126
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
thank you

1127
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,520
and our last question for today

1128
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,680
hi i i don't really have a question i

1129
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,520
just have a

1130
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,720
suggestion

1131
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
um i know in switzerland there's a big

1132
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,119
initiative now trying to copy the repair

1133
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,680
vouchers they're very inspired and i've

1134
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,040
been pushing the local councillors to

1135
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,119
activate that so they're working

1136
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,720
actively on it and also they're trying

1137
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,200
to attach a reuse center to their

1138
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,800
recycling centers

1139
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,040
so if you can all contact your local

1140
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,200
councillors and push for that and say

1141
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
you want to reuse center for all your

1142
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
equipment because if you're also running

1143
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,200
a repair cafe i'm sure you know there's

1144
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
two on rails trying to get the spare

1145
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,720
parts off and you can take it out of

1146
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,560
another machine that has a different

1147
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,440
part broken so that would also be nice

1148
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,880
to just collect all these things as

1149
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,960
spare parts absolutely

1150
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,280
excellent suggestion thank you very much

1151
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
