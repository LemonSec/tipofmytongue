2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
we're gonna go ahead to our next speaker

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
um short introduction because he will

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,720
show very cool things i'm just gonna say

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
it's gonna be great talk

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,880
ariane lara moreno please give him a

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,320
very big hand have fun

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,760
[Applause]

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,079
good evening everybody and thanks for

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,399
joining my talk maybe that late in the

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,360
evening

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
i know it might be a little bit tired

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
but i hope that probably hopefully it

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
will be worth it for all of you

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,280
i'm going to talk about how to

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
successfully build and

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,399
program some field control systems

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
my name is adrian and i'm the head of

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
research and hollow blood i've been in

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,760
the company since

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
already more than 10 years

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,800
so

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
there's plenty of much that we can tell

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
you about

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,640
i would probably not be wrong by

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
assuming a bunch of people in the

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
audience area have had some kind of

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,799
music making experience or to actually

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
make music

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
so

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
music music making is an exciting

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,600
creative process where pretty much there

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,280
are no boundaries set

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
i would like to distinguish two separate

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
processes in in the stage of making

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,079
music

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
not strictly independent from each other

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,799
but not always really

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,880
properly interconnected

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,439
those would be the music production and

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,639
the music reproduction

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,439
in the music production phase is where

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
creativity plays the biggest role and

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,960
where artists take the leap in adopting

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
and driving innovation

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
synthesizers and samplers

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,600
did revolutionize the way music is being

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,159
produced and expanded the creative

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
capabilities of many artists in ways

50
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
they could not imagine before

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,160
new software driven digital signal

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
processing filters or effects

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
also introduce new unique ways of

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,760
personalize your production

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
some artists even made themselves some

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,879
style or signature that they are well

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
known and recognized for one example of

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
them would be daft cam duff punk with

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
the use of the

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
effect of bulk order

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,000
traditional

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,720
music creation using instruments it's

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
also constantly finding new ways of

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,480
evolving and combining new

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,560
instruments

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
and finally there are many different

67
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,480
ways of interacting with

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,720
music and triggering sound using very

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,239
uncommon

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
objects such as for example the steps on

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
a staircase

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
or use sound actually in a stimulus for

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
other effects such as video lights and

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
many other

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,879
one great example of interacting with

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
many different

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,840
of sound interacting with many different

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
materials

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
that would be

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
from the video clip of

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
nigel stanford called music vs science

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
which i really recommend you to take a

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
look at

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,519
now that we've got our production ready

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,319
we surely want to reproduce it and show

86
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
it to the world right

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
there are plenty of different

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
reproduction systems that you can use

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,360
for that

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
among the most common ones you can find

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
mono systems stereo surround or even

92
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,840
atmos or

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,200
ambisonics in state of the art projects

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
the biggest disadvantage of these kind

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,959
of systems is that

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,680
even when correctly deployed

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
they only deliver the desired experience

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
to a very reduced number of people in

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
the audience

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
that is also what

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
is

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,839
typically well known as the sweet spot

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
very few people know actually where

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,840
their music is going to end up being

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
reproduced and even fewer people take

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,798
into consideration

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
the sound system for the music

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,320
production phase

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
actually the chances of your music

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
production being properly experienced as

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
you might have conceived in the

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
production phase

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
are quite low

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,199
which actually brings me to

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,280
my next questions and more or less the

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
topic of my talk

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
which is

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
what if the loudspeaker system would

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,040
take part in your creative music making

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,440
process

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
i would like to introduce you to

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,639
soundtrack control systems particularly

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
those with

124
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
3d capabilities as that is the case of

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
hollow blood which we hopefully

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
will get to experience today as well

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,000
the idea of using array of speakers to

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
shape sound using beamforming has been

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
around for many years but until now it

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
has been very difficult to achieve and

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
put into practice both for the

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
horizontal and vertical axis

133
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,160
simultaneously

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
beamforming is a technique that implies

135
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
the usage of multiple large speakers

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,680
and interference between them

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
and they would put many of these

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
speakers in the form of an array a line

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
array or a matrix array in case that it

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
would be like a two-dimensional speaker

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,440
surface

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
they also are commonly driven by a

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
digital signal stage but i will talk

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
more about this a little bit later

145
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,440
with beamforming one can control the

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,199
size shape

147
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
and direction of the sound field of the

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
loudspeaker

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,960
but before getting a little bit more

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
into detail of

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,360
how bing4 main speaker systems

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
function i would like to introduce you

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
to a couple of acoustical

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
theoretical principles that would help

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
you understand how these systems work

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
to understand how loudspeaker can

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
interfere with another one when they are

158
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
built in the line array let's first take

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
a look at what the radiation pattern of

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
the loudspeaker looks like

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
let's have a look at the radiation of a

162
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,720
single cone

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
loudspeaker and we'll take the example

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
of a four inch

165
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,120
loudspeaker or driver or transducer as

166
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
i would use any of those terms

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,120
for the same purpose which is

168
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,039
loudspeakers

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,130
at low frequencies the wavelength of the

170
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,440
[Music]

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
of sound is way larger than the size of

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,360
the driver

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
so the resulting sound field from the

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
the transducer at the low frequencies

175
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,599
will be

176
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,759
spreading spreading out evenly in all

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
directions with the same level

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
at mid frequencies when the wavelength

179
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
that we are reproducing is more or less

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,479
the same size of the driver where that

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
we are using to reproduce sound

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
you will hear louder sound in front of

183
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
the loudspeaker and if you move sideways

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
the sound level will decrease a little

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
bit

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,960
at high frequencies when the wavefront

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
is much smaller than the wavelength

188
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
that we are reproducing

189
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
sorry at high frequencies when the

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,919
wavelength is way smaller than the

191
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,280
loudspeaker

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,240
the radiation pattern would look as its

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
own in the picture which is it would be

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,440
quite

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
um having a very rapidly level decrease

196
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
if you move from the oxide from from the

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
axis different uh position

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,590
from the loudspeaker

199
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,840
[Music]

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
now the relationship between the

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
wavelength and the frequency is given by

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
the following formula

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
where

204
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,879
lambda equal c divided by f where lambda

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,680
is the wavelength that we are

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
reproducing c would be the speed of

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
sound typically

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,479
the value having values of 340 meters

209
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,680
per second

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
and f would be the frequency

211
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
equivalently from that wavelength as

212
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,039
well

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
as a summary from this slide

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
one could say that the loudspeaker

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
radiates

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
um

217
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
have a directivity back then that looks

218
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,479
differently for all different

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,000
frequencies

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
as a consequence the the beam or the

221
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
sound field or the coverage for that

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
loudspeaker will look differently

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
depending on the direction where you are

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
actually listening to that loudspeaker

225
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
if you could be for example on axis like

226
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
listening right in front of the

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
loudspeaker you will hear all

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
frequencies with more or less the same

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,959
level but if you will move sideways you

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,360
will find out like having

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
you will experience different levels

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
between the low frequencies and the high

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,280
frequencies

234
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,680
[Music]

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,399
now that we know how a loudspeaker

236
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
radiates sound at different frequencies

237
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
let's take a look at the interference of

238
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
two sound waves

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
mostly when they are both overlapping

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
with each other so interference is a

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,839
phenomenon that

242
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,320
describes when two waves overlap

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
with each other and they form another

244
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
wave which might having

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
a louder higher level or a

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
lower amplitude level

247
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
two waves of the same amplitude and

248
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,320
frequency

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
which are in phase interfere in a

250
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
constructive manner resulting in a wave

251
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,240
of double of the amplitude this is also

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
known as constructive interference

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
when two waves are 180 degrees out of

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
phase

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,519
they interfere in a destructive manner

256
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
and cancel each other completely

257
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,760
producing some silence

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
this is also called as destructive

259
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,399
interference

260
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,880
advanced loudspeaker arrays rely on the

261
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,079
principle of controlled interference

262
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
that is based on the precise

263
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
manipulation of phase between the

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,800
loudspeakers built in the in the lineary

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
a couple of slides before

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
remember we learned that a lot speaker

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
radiates differently for load mid and

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
high frequencies

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
if we want to cause interference between

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
several speakers in the array we need to

271
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
put them close enough so that the

272
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
dispersion button overlaps physically

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
and they can accordingly interfere with

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
each other

275
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
to understand how wave interference

276
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
occurs in space

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,399
let's take a look at a couple of

278
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
examples using a monopole source

279
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
a monopole source is a theoretical

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
infinitely small sound source that

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
radiates energy with equal level in all

282
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
directions for all frequencies

283
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
the uh picture that i'm showing right

284
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,720
now it's the the diagram the activity

285
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
diagram or the radiation pattern of a

286
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
monopole

287
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
source which uh from these pictures you

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
can see on the top one that would be the

289
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
the pressure level where you can see the

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
wavefront

291
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
which basically tell us how the wave

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
travels across space and time

293
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,760
and if you would take that same

294
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
information and

295
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,279
take a look at the

296
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,519
the bottom diagram that would be the

297
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
equivalent level of that sound wave

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
when um when it's been taken in a db

299
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,399
scale

300
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
that would be what is also known as an

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
spl map

302
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,440
now if we would place two sources with a

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
distance of half of the wavelength

304
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
that we want to to control that we want

305
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,959
to interfere with that would result in

306
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,839
constructed interference in the front

307
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,079
and the rear directions

308
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
whereas it will also cause destructive

309
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
interference in the 90 degrees

310
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
directions that would be on the left and

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,360
right

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
axis from the loudspeaker

313
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,000
now using four monopole sources

314
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
also distance half of the wavelength

315
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
from each other

316
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
even more narrow radiation pattern will

317
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
result in the front and back radiation

318
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
and

319
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
in all the different directions we will

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
have like either constructed or

321
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,079
destructive interference depending on

322
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
the angle where we are positioned

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,279
it's also important to know that the

324
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
amplitude of the

325
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
resulting narrower beam if you look at

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
the latest spl map

327
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,959
it's louder than the original one from

328
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,200
the monopole source as we also landed in

329
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
the constructed interference

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
interference

331
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,680
slide before

332
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
now the radiation pattern of an acoustic

333
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,440
source is given in a certain given plane

334
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
in this case the the horizontal plane if

335
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,519
you would cut a horizontal section of

336
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,959
that

337
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,560
group of large speakers

338
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
we will end up with what i'm showing in

339
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,180
this

340
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,560
[Music]

341
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
in this plot here which is called the

342
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
which is also called as the activity

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
diagram

344
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
in there we can see many different

345
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
components the main one would be the

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,040
main lobe

347
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
or the main beam which is

348
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
basically

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
the lobe of energy containing the

350
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,839
highest energy in all

351
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,279
directions typically shooting in the

352
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
direction of interest for example the on

353
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
this area

354
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
grating and side lobes

355
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,480
are beams with less energy that travel

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
in undesired directions

357
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
and they are the result of special

358
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440
aliasing effects

359
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
uh that typically happens when you put

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,079
deposition transducers two distance from

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,560
each other so they don't really

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,399
properly interfere with each other in a

363
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,639
constructive matter

364
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
the directivity diagram is widely used

365
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,079
to represent the dispersion behavior of

366
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
pin forming loudspeakers

367
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
now line arrays combine the acoustical

368
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
output from

369
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,360
multiple speakers to obtain a narrow

370
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
beam

371
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,760
in the front direction of the liner

372
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,839
sound field control

373
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
using line arrays is achieved using many

374
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,639
different techniques

375
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
for example we could mechanically tilt

376
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
the array so that the main lobe travels

377
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
in a different direction the direction

378
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,600
where we want to

379
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
to cover at the main audience area

380
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,920
or alternatively we could build many

381
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
loudspeakers in that array with

382
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,279
different sizes and dispersion patterns

383
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,760
and also tilt them mechanically with

384
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,199
different angles

385
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,000
so that they effectively cover a wide

386
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
audience area

387
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,480
one example of this type of loudspeaker

388
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
probably already familiar with them that

389
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
would be this also commonly known as

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
banana shaped line arrays or also j

391
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
shape

392
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
that combined that that effectively

393
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,880
combined the

394
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
different large speakers mechanically

395
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,079
tilted differently with different

396
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,959
dispersion angles

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
another approach to control the main

398
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,959
loop

399
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,720
would be not using mechanical steering

400
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
or mechanical tilting but actually

401
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,480
having still a flat line array and

402
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
including a digital signal processing

403
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,600
stage

404
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,560
also called as a dsp stage

405
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,240
in between the signal input and the

406
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
line array that we're using to control

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
the main bin

408
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
this principle is also known as digital

409
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
beam steering as obviously it involves a

410
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,639
digital signal processing stage in this

411
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,100
process

412
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,360
[Music]

413
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,320
now

414
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,360
if we zoom in into the required dsp

415
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
that would be just one example of what

416
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
we can use

417
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
we could steer the main lobe to a given

418
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
direction in this case theta

419
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,519
by

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,519
applying a delay to each of the large

421
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
speakers building the array

422
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
the delay for each large speaker channel

423
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,600
can be calculated using a the formula

424
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
that i'm showing in the slide

425
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
which pretty much is dependent on the

426
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
distance between the loudspeakers

427
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,720
and the angle that we want the beam to

428
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,759
be steered into

429
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
now as a result if you look at the

430
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
directory diagram

431
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,399
on the right hand side

432
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
the main lobe is now formed to travel in

433
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,959
the desired direction theta

434
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,920
which is defined from the on axis angle

435
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
of the line array

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
since we are changing the radiation

437
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,399
pattern by using control interference

438
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
that effect also the complete radiation

439
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,000
pattern or the dirty diagram of the

440
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
of the liner so as a result not only the

441
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
main lobe is steered into the desired

442
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,119
direction

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
but also the rest of the artifacts

444
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
produced by

445
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,959
this kind of beam steering

446
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,079
are also moving into different

447
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
directions i'm talking precisely about

448
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,959
the

449
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
grating lobes the rear lobe and the side

450
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,439
lobes as you see also on the diagram

451
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,000
they also are quarterly steered

452
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,439
depending on the

453
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,240
steering angle

454
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,400
now i would like to summarize and lay

455
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
out the differences between different

456
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
sound field control systems

457
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,320
but first um

458
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
it's not really a proper

459
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
sound field control system per se but

460
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
it's a loud speaker a point source but

461
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
nevertheless i think it's it's worth to

462
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
mention um the behavior and the

463
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
differences

464
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
so the first one that i'm introducing

465
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
are point sources

466
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
which um they do not actually offer any

467
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
kind of sound control in space other

468
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
than the one where

469
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,640
that is being decided during the design

470
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
and manufacturing process of that

471
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,679
specific

472
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,799
point source speaker

473
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
then we have digitally driven line

474
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
arrays that offer the possibility to

475
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,280
control the main lobe in the direction

476
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,840
where the array is built in

477
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
in the example that i'm showing in the

478
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
slide the line array is built on the

479
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
vertical direction so as a result the

480
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
pin steering will be

481
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
capable of being achieved in that

482
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
direction so we will be able to do

483
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
beam forming

484
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
in the vertical axis with this line

485
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
array

486
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
and finally many large speakers can be

487
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
stacked normally vertically but also

488
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
horizontally

489
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
resulting in what is also called as a

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
matrix array

491
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
matrix arrays

492
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,280
benefit from sound field control in the

493
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
horizontal and vertical axis

494
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
independently

495
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,880
resulting in full 3d control of the beam

496
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,360
in all directions

497
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
holo plot could be an unique example of

498
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,559
a 3d soundtrack control system

499
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,280
now i would like to mention a couple of

500
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,480
considerations needed to understand the

501
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,280
beamforming at different frequencies

502
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,360
when using sound field control systems

503
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
the highest frequency control is defined

504
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,679
by the driver spacing

505
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,679
probably you might remember from the

506
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
slide of the interference

507
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
across space

508
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
as we learned previously

509
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
the control phase interference is

510
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
possible when the distance between two

511
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,679
large speakers

512
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
enables the resulting

513
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,080
directivity pattern to overlap

514
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
physically

515
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,600
in that case

516
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
we need exactly to have at least half of

517
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
the wavelength of the frequency that we

518
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
want to control

519
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
in the directivity diagram that i'm

520
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
showing on the

521
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
top right hand side

522
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,120
the full control of the main lobe is

523
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
possible without any additional

524
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,159
artifacts

525
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,919
and that would be possible as the

526
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,320
example frequency that i'm visualizing

527
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,880
would be below the frequency control of

528
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
that specific

529
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
matrix array design

530
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,440
on the other hand on the bottom right

531
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
hand side the example frequency would be

532
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,039
above

533
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,840
the frequency control of that matrix

534
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
array

535
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
so as a result we

536
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
can control the main lobe into a

537
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
different direction but additionally we

538
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,559
would get also

539
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,039
some artifacts resulting from under

540
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,840
sampling of the wavefront because of the

541
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
distance from the loudspeakers would be

542
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
too far for that frequency that we want

543
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
to control

544
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
on the other hand on the other side of

545
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,960
the outer spectrum

546
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
on the low frequencies

547
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
because the wavelength is so large we

548
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
will need to have speakers

549
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,120
spaced enough and sufficiently to be

550
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,240
able to

551
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
to control that low frequencies

552
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
specifically again that would be at

553
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
least half of the wavelength

554
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,919
so that would be at least what we need

555
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,760
to have our array

556
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
built in

557
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
so the lowest frequency that we can

558
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
control with matrix arrays would be

559
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,919
given by the actual dimensions of the

560
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
matrix array

561
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
in this case since matrix arrays have

562
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
two dimensions the horizontal and the

563
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
vertical

564
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,720
one could um

565
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
define separately the

566
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,600
low frequency control in each of those

567
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,799
axis

568
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
to give an example and using the the

569
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
plot that i'm visualizing on the right

570
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
hand side

571
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
one could

572
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,919
control the opening angle of the 100

573
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,880
hertz frequency beam

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
and narrow it down to a 60 degree

575
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
opening angle

576
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
so to achieve that we one would need a

577
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,880
an array of four meters width on the

578
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
horizontal axis

579
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
and

580
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,520
the other way around if one would want

581
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
to also control or like come up with the

582
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
required length

583
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
on the vertical axis

584
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,840
the same plot can be used

585
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
next i want to

586
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
show you some

587
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
features of 3d sound field control

588
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,039
systems and how they can be used as a

589
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,440
creative toolkit for your content

590
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,919
creation

591
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
but before jumping into the creative

592
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,200
side i would like to

593
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,799
mention some of the inherent benefits of

594
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
3d sound field control systems

595
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,640
that put them actually in a very

596
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
advantageous position when compared to

597
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
other sound systems such as obviously

598
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,559
point sources or even line arrays

599
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
first thanks to the beamforming

600
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,960
capabilities the horizontal and vertical

601
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
axis independently the dispersion

602
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
pattern of the beam can be defined

603
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
to precisely and optimally cover

604
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
whatever audience area

605
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,679
that the user can define that would be

606
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,320
the beam can adapt in terms of size

607
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,600
in terms of

608
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
shape

609
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
and as an example i'm showing the

610
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
diagram

611
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
of the spl plot as well resulting from a

612
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,679
simulation of a matrix array on the

613
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,039
right hand side

614
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,840
where

615
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
i wanted to show this one because this

616
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,679
is particularly challenging as

617
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,919
it is exactly doing the opposite as the

618
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,799
nature of sound waves propagation would

619
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,840
tell us which is a typical sound source

620
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
will spread

621
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
with distance

622
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,640
and will reduce level

623
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
in that beamforming that we are

624
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
visualizing on that

625
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
on these plots

626
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,039
the

627
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
the beam is actually converging on the

628
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,159
far distances also increasing the level

629
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,400
and on the closer distances

630
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
the uh the opening angle is quite open

631
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,400
and and or quite wide

632
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,840
and the level has to be accordingly

633
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
reduced so this is as i mentioned before

634
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,240
doing exactly the opposite as

635
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
what it should be doing to be considered

636
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,610
a loudspeaker

637
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,480
[Music]

638
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
so um because of that position in

639
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,400
delivering sound only where it's needed

640
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,120
the reflections from badly

641
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
treated venues or spaces are minimized

642
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
resulting in an increase of the direct

643
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
reverend ratio

644
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,200
in that specific venus system

645
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
as a result the speech intelligently

646
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,120
index

647
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
will increase

648
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,120
delivering crystal clear messages

649
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
to most of the

650
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
audience area

651
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
even in very challenging

652
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
acoustic venues

653
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,120
just to quickly mention the speech and

654
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
eligibility index is a value between

655
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
zero and one that describes the quality

656
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,440
of the specific system delivering a

657
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,480
message

658
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
in a specific venue

659
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,399
so obviously the higher the better

660
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,720
finally and directly resulting as well

661
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,679
from the

662
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,159
precise sound field control of our

663
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,240
systems the noise pollution can be

664
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
greatly improved

665
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
meaning you could run

666
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,120
shows

667
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
with

668
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
like either outdoor or in inside the

669
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,559
venue with less noise pollution and you

670
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
could even run multiple shows in

671
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,520
parallel

672
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,120
if those would be played at the

673
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
frequency where the array can still

674
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,480
control this frequency

675
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
now finally let's take a look at how we

676
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
can use holo plot or any 3d sound fill

677
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,679
control system

678
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,400
as a creative tool to enhance

679
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
your show production with effects and

680
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
features that you might not never

681
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,360
thought about before

682
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,200
with holo plot you can configure

683
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
multiple beams simultaneously from the

684
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,400
same array

685
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
each with its own content eq

686
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
level and shape

687
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
you can easily deliver

688
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
content to

689
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,799
various locations using beams

690
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,799
with different properties

691
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
some of the applications of this feature

692
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
for example could be running a

693
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
multilingual conference room by

694
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
physically splitting the room into

695
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
different

696
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,880
beams with different languages

697
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
another example would be delivering

698
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
information around exhibits in a museum

699
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
or

700
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
dividing or showing

701
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
or delivering different beams into

702
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
adjacent

703
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,320
platforms in a train station

704
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
holo plot sound field control algorithms

705
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
are capable of tightly focusing audio

706
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,480
content

707
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,440
onto small groups of people even down to

708
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400
individual

709
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
members in the audience area

710
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,159
this is a unique and powerful tool

711
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,120
for creating targeted sound experiences

712
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,360
in the venue experiences that actually

713
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,799
change as you move across the audience

714
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,919
area

715
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,679
so basically what you hear what you will

716
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
experience will depend on where you are

717
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,039
to be some examples that

718
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,360
where we could use this feature

719
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
what we have done in the past is to

720
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,880
recreate and the virtual acoustics of a

721
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
specific venue for example a church

722
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
and we have delivered like a single

723
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
message to a single person in the

724
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
audience area

725
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
that only that person would hear and the

726
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,559
rest of the people was here just the

727
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,120
acoustics of the venue

728
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,679
another example would be um that we have

729
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
used quite often in trade shows we had

730
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,960
our from our booth that was more or less

731
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,279
in the middle of the of the

732
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,039
space in the thread show and we were

733
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,960
like shooting a

734
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
a focused beamed or focused

735
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,399
targeted area to the main entrance of

736
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,600
the hall and we were greeting and and

737
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
cheering up people to come to us as well

738
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,159
so this is ingrid indeed a great tool

739
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,360
for sound designers as it really creates

740
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,039
truly novel

741
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
experiences that were not

742
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,399
possible before

743
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,360
holo plot also develops and deploys wave

744
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
synthesis algorithms i didn't want to

745
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,279
get much into detail in this

746
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,760
presentation but basically the array

747
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
synthesizes also concave wavefronts that

748
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
converge in one specific point in the

749
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
audience area

750
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,039
as a result the sound pressure level at

751
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
that specific point is way louder than

752
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,960
any other position in the audience area

753
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,120
that is also what we called and focused

754
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
virtual sources

755
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,520
those focus with resources can be placed

756
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
on the audience area creating a

757
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
proximity effect something similar as if

758
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
someone would speak to you at a close

759
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,000
distance

760
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
but you can also place those focus grid

761
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
resources on walls or surfaces in the

762
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,720
venue so that

763
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,440
they reflect back to the audience area

764
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
something similar as if you would

765
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,840
use a mirror to reflect light to a

766
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,320
different direction

767
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,039
these targeted reflections are localized

768
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
in the wall and not from the matrix

769
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,440
array so as a result

770
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,919
you can experience them as if there will

771
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,960
be like one additional sun source or a

772
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
slot speaker that you can use for

773
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,320
effects

774
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
so basically even if you have a

775
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
centralized systems you could still

776
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,760
deploy a fully immersive experience

777
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,480
in

778
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
the venue that you are deploying that

779
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
system

780
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,840
all right now that um you know enough

781
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
about sound field control systems

782
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
and

783
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,399
you might want to build your own

784
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,360
prototype one or your own so this is

785
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,000
what you might need for it

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
you need to get your hands both on the

787
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
hardware and software development since

788
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
they both are

789
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
dependent from each other and also a

790
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
requirement

791
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,960
on the software end you will need to

792
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,799
implement the beamforming algorithms

793
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,279
required to make the calculations that i

794
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
described before

795
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
i mentioned before that very simple

796
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,640
approach to do beam steering but there

797
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,600
are many more available in the

798
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,480
literature and on the internet that are

799
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,799
either more complex or adapted to matrix

800
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,279
arrays as well

801
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
so before you have implemented the

802
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
or after you have implemented the

803
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
beamforming algorithms you might be you

804
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,360
might want to control them with the user

805
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,600
interface some typical parameters might

806
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,919
be of course opening angle or steering

807
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
angle

808
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,880
and those will be

809
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
will as a result trigger new

810
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,000
calculations of the bin forming

811
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
algorithms

812
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,080
those resulting coefficients

813
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,640
will be applied into the dsp stage which

814
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,679
is the one in charge of processing the

815
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,559
audio input to the system

816
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,279
a good selection of dsp blocks that are

817
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,039
required to do

818
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
beamforming would be

819
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,799
gain delay

820
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,120
and filters such as firs or iirs

821
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
depending on the beamforming algorithm

822
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,159
that you pick you might need some of

823
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,960
them or all of them

824
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,799
now of course our purpose is not to

825
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,679
process

826
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,159
a single large speaker but to actually

827
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,720
build a soundfield control system

828
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,760
so you're gonna need a multiple of those

829
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,080
and channels being processed in parallel

830
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,799
one for each of the loudspeaker

831
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,840
built and mounted into your matrix array

832
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,640
and finally each of those

833
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,559
resulting

834
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,399
coefficients from the algorithm will

835
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,840
have an update into each of the dsp

836
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
blocks whenever a change happens on the

837
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
user interface

838
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
and also

839
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,720
triggers a change of the coefficients

840
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,279
required

841
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
finally we need to feed all the

842
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
resulting channels from this dcp

843
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,679
processing stage into the amplifier so

844
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
that we can accordingly um feed the

845
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,519
signals into each of the

846
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,200
speakers of the matrix array

847
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
individually

848
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,399
and we need to have a multi-channel

849
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,000
amplifier as of course each of the

850
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,360
signals is individual for each

851
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,000
loudspeaker

852
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,399
now if you feel like building everything

853
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
from scratch is too much our friends

854
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
from hackaday have a nice project

855
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,279
description for loudspeaker face to race

856
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,559
and of course

857
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,640
if you're not afraid of complexity you

858
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
can go beyond that and build the matrix

859
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,480
ray your own

860
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,640
here are some old memories from our

861
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,919
first prototype back in 2012.

862
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,919
as you can see already in the complexity

863
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,240
it's quite large and and there's not

864
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
even any electronics involved in there

865
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,880
yet

866
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
well now that you understand

867
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,240
how great sound 3 control systems are

868
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,360
you know

869
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,519
you might want to know what is required

870
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
to build your own system but most

871
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
importantly i would like to give you as

872
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,159
well an overview of all the complexity

873
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,159
and the challenges that we had to

874
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,440
overcome

875
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
during the last years in our company

876
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,679
one of the main challenges is high count

877
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,080
numbers everything at hollow plot is

878
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
large

879
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,120
the number of large speakers the

880
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,880
computer the computational power

881
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,120
required for it the number of supported

882
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,480
audio modules the it infrastructure

883
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,720
the data being transferred the number of

884
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,080
outer channels being being transferred

885
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,039
the number of bugs as well um

886
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,720
well that one that one is actually a

887
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,480
joke

888
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,159
one thing that we got quite used to in

889
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,080
in our system is to to push the

890
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,000
boundaries of every single components

891
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,919
that it's built in in our system

892
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,120
now we'd like to give you a quick

893
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
overview of the infrastructure that we

894
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
have built

895
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,039
so first of course we need to have our

896
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,440
matrix arrays which are formed by

897
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
stacking audi modules horizontally and

898
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,480
vertically

899
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,399
the matrix arrays receive the

900
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
configuration from the controllers

901
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
using a redundant network

902
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,879
also the controllers are redundant since

903
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,239
this is one of the main requirements of

904
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,239
our systems they need to be robust and

905
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,679
they need to be

906
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,480
having no single point of failure

907
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,440
the the redundancy mechanism was in this

908
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,199
case particularly challenging to build

909
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,119
because having two controllers only

910
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,760
would not provide the majority of of

911
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,639
both

912
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,119
required to solve the latest status of

913
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,879
the system in case something went wrong

914
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,599
the parameters of the system design

915
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,520
and the ones required to achieve the

916
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,480
array configuration come from a planning

917
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,199
software what we call whole plot plan

918
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,159
which can generate the projects required

919
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
for the system both in an online and

920
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,599
offline mode

921
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,079
and finally the audio

922
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,520
source

923
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,079
is coming from either a

924
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,839
mixing desk or a digital audio

925
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,480
workstation that speaks

926
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,400
or can transmit all the overhappy

927
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,880
holobot systems are designed to be

928
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,280
decentralized and scalable

929
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
our biggest

930
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,560
installation and project so far we have

931
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,800
more than 2 000 audio modules in the

932
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,240
same network

933
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
so delivering redundant data and audio

934
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,079
to so many units in the same network is

935
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,880
particularly challenging

936
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,480
and to give an example

937
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,359
many ip solutions that we had to uh to

938
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,760
fight for or that we were considering

939
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
don't support more than 200 devices

940
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,240
simultaneously so this is like way a

941
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,320
large difference

942
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,640
and also something mentioning

943
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,119
perhaps which is interesting is that

944
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,960
what up what i've been showing here that

945
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,359
we have come up in our system

946
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,720
uh took

947
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,280
over more than three years of a team of

948
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
20 full-time engineers to build and of

949
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,319
course this is not yet fully finished

950
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
now i would like to zoom in into one of

951
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,680
each of these components to give a

952
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,640
little more of information and details

953
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,119
whole upload plan is in charge of

954
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,680
configuring optimizing and simulating

955
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
our matrix arrays

956
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
it builds online and offline

957
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
functionalities as i mentioned before

958
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,599
and it's built using protocol buffers

959
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
over grpc

960
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,440
that's a decision we pick because of the

961
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,240
easy subscription mechanism the bug

962
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,920
force compatibility

963
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,839
that it offers and the efficient

964
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,079
transmission that we can

965
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,680
get from transmitting data into the

966
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,839
controllers

967
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,880
it also builds a complex 3d environment

968
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,680
that can do real-time simulation of our

969
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,920
matrix arrays and then again remember

970
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,680
any kind of simulation

971
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
using as many transducers

972
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
that are built in our systems is again

973
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,160
specifically

974
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,720
particularly challenging

975
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,280
now let's talk a little bit about the

976
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
playback

977
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,200
section of the system

978
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,440
we are also working on a software that

979
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,160
where we can control and render audio

980
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,000
objects that are going to be reproduced

981
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
in our system

982
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,320
but the biggest challenges come from

983
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,520
sending

984
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,240
the

985
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
metadata of this audio object in

986
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
combination with the audio streams to

987
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,800
all the modules in the system and that

988
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
they actually received

989
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
to each of the modules in a sample

990
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,040
accuracy

991
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,240
so that's something that we're still

992
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,359
working on

993
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
and this piece of software is also

994
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
specifically

995
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,040
interesting for um show designers as as

996
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
of today there is no even

997
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
state-of-the-art plugins or softwares

998
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,320
the only thing they can deliver is to um

999
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
to send

1000
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,839
or to render audio objects in in any

1001
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,880
other system but none of the specific

1002
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
features that our system can deliver so

1003
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,040
that's also one of the tasks that we are

1004
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,160
currently trying to solve

1005
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,040
now about the controllers the

1006
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,119
controllers are the core of all the

1007
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
hollow plot infrastructure it is based

1008
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,400
on yukto and takes care of sending and

1009
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
collecting information to the audio

1010
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
modules

1011
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,119
for matrix arrays

1012
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,000
providing also updates over the air both

1013
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,800
for

1014
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,480
their own system of the controller but

1015
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
also for the audio modules

1016
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
it is written in go

1017
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,640
and is built with many open source

1018
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,960
projects some of them we have even built

1019
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,599
our own and they are of course released

1020
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,599
to the community as well so you can you

1021
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,400
free to check out our github profile for

1022
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
that

1023
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,960
[Music]

1024
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,880
and finally um as i already mentioned

1025
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
before when it comes to the matrix

1026
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,800
arrays or the audio modules the biggest

1027
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,200
challenge is the in the audio modules

1028
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,359
come from the high number of

1029
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,920
loudspeakers that we have built in there

1030
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,200
in each of them we have almost 100

1031
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
loudspeakers per audi model

1032
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
each other module needs to process

1033
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
up to 1.7 billion multiplications per

1034
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,839
second

1035
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,440
something which is even challenging for

1036
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,280
many state-of-the-art dsp platforms

1037
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,560
and

1038
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,760
of course each audio module

1039
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
that we have done also implements many

1040
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,480
sensors

1041
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
and many properties that we can track in

1042
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,760
real time such as the temperature and

1043
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,320
amplifier status loudspeaker status so a

1044
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
bunch of data that we capture from the

1045
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,839
module in real time and we send back to

1046
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,839
the

1047
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,520
and finally

1048
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
speeding or wanting to speed the

1049
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,160
development of integrating by

1050
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,079
integrating third party solutions is not

1051
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,800
always as efficient as anybody can think

1052
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
about

1053
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,560
so

1054
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,280
we deal constantly with

1055
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
with the boundaries and the limitations

1056
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,920
that these third-party solutions

1057
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,000
oppose to us such as for example the

1058
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,160
available apis that they deliver

1059
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,400
they are specifically

1060
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
on the edge of what they can

1061
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,960
afford or what they can allow

1062
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,800
and as we have like quite an extreme

1063
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
usage because of the again the high

1064
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,520
number of loudspeakers

1065
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,520
and finally i wanted to also quick a

1066
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,200
quick um

1067
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,720
overview about the testing challenge

1068
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,000
that we had

1069
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,440
something that we had to solve by um

1070
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
i mean testing our system is quite

1071
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,560
challenging because we need to test the

1072
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
software we need to test the hardware as

1073
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
as we also developed it and we need to

1074
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
test integration from all of them so we

1075
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
had to build or came up with that

1076
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,240
dedicated testing room which is

1077
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,040
specially equipped with it to automate

1078
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,359
the testing the compilation and the

1079
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,599
deployment of the new releases

1080
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,599
and of course as everything it related

1081
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,839
we also faced the challenge that it

1082
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,599
doesn't matter how many deployments we

1083
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,000
we test in-house the clients and the

1084
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,079
users will actually end up always with

1085
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,440
something different that we haven't ever

1086
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
tested before or any new device that

1087
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
interferes quickly with something else

1088
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
in the system

1089
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
and last to i know as an overall

1090
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,839
conclusion for

1091
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,359
for this presentation

1092
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,760
green fielding which is what we did is

1093
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,800
both great and challenging so don't be

1094
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,620
surprised if you end up

1095
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,079
[Music]

1096
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,920
if you need to reinvent yourself across

1097
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,640
the

1098
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,560
way since you're going to end up most

1099
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
certainly trapped in a corner quite

1100
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,839
often

1101
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,200
however

1102
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,359
fielding allows you to pick cutting-edge

1103
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,359
technologies that most of the times will

1104
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,680
actually make your life easier more

1105
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,960
efficient

1106
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,040
and indeed it will be more exciting

1107
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,520
so now i want to that's the end of my

1108
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
presentation

1109
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,599
now i want to show you those examples

1110
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,800
not now that you know as well the

1111
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,880
features that the system can do

1112
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,560
um let's see

1113
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,599
how

1114
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,839
you guys react to it so for that i would

1115
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,200
like to

1116
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,359
thank you

1117
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,520
i would like to ask you guys to stand up

1118
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,560
yes yes

1119
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,720
and i'm gonna just play something that

1120
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,079
we have prepared and let's see what

1121
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,930
happens

1122
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,149
[Music]

1123
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,069
[Music]

1124
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
so as you saw

1125
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,319
because we were able to split the

1126
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,640
audience area into two halves

1127
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,400
we were able to also deliver different

1128
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,200
messages as i mentioned before with

1129
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,520
by providing different content and yeah

1130
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
we gave a different message to each of

1131
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,420
you

1132
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,160
[Music]

1133
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,760
we're going to also show just a couple

1134
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
of other examples where we use the same

1135
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,960
functionality but for a different

1136
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,119
purpose so we want to show

1137
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,680
also from the multiple language

1138
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
just a couple of

1139
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
languages

1140
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
for these audience areas

1141
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
feel free to move or change the audience

1142
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,000
area if you want

1143
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,680
as you will also be able to experience

1144
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,839
the change when you move from one zone

1145
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,319
to the other one

1146
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,119
okay

1147
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,649
[Music]

1148
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,599
now of course you might think that this

1149
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,240
is easy because you have like two zones

1150
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
and two matrix arrays

1151
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,359
so now we're gonna do the same exercise

1152
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,960
we're gonna have two separate zones but

1153
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,720
it's gonna be coming only for one of

1154
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,079
those arrays

1155
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,440
in this case it's gonna be the left

1156
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,000
array which i assume is this one maybe

1157
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,599
that's the other way around and we're

1158
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,520
also gonna show some

1159
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,200
special effects

1160
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,240
that are

1161
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,160
being reproduced in each of these areas

1162
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,000
but always remember it's coming from one

1163
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
of the arrays then later on i will

1164
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,680
change the other array so that you can

1165
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,520
experience the same

1166
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,599
effect but coming from different matrix

1167
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,839
arrays

1168
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,519
[Music]

1169
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
we've only programmed it out of the left

1170
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,400
nothing's gonna go it's only from the

1171
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,079
left not the left

1172
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,079
okay

1173
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:10,689
[Music]

1174
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,119
here's the next one i made a mistake and

1175
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,960
it's always coming from this array so

1176
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,319
that one is not programmed yet

1177
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,160
[Music]

1178
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,160
so

1179
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,640
he was the last one

1180
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,670
[Music]

1181
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
just couple of more just five more

1182
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,280
minutes

1183
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,720
is playing there you go

1184
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,940
[Music]

1185
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,960
we have two minutes in total

1186
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,599
so the questions are demo demo up

1187
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,480
all right time is out so

1188
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,240
if someone wants to make any question

1189
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
it's now the time or

1190
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,960
i have another another demo for three

1191
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
focus points so either we make a

1192
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
question or i show the demo okay let's

1193
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,800
do a vote who wants

1194
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,560
to ask a question

1195
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
there's one there's one really really

1196
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,240
ones and who wants a demo or what

1197
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,079
there's more people wanting the demo but

1198
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,599
not that much

1199
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,240
that and i'll give a good floor to did

1200
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,599
this isn't to you you want to do the
