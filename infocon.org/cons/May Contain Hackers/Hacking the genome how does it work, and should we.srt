2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
i want to tell you a little bit about

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
dna and

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,279
hacking the dna because like oscar

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,359
already said it's surprisingly digital

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
which also makes it sort of our thing

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
in a way

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,840
and part of hacking dna the way

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,719
professionals do it is remarkably

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,800
using words like that we know like

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
there's even a thing called shell code

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,239
in there

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
which is just like the shell codes that

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,200
we know

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,160
so i'm going to start off very briefly

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
by thanking all the people that made all

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,239
the nice pictures that i

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
lovingly borrowed for this presentation

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
if you go to the url you can see the

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
credits exactly who made them

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
oskar already introduced me so i'm not

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,440
originally a biologist but i started

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
studying dna in 2001

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
and over time apparently i managed to

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
fool some people

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
that i'm a real biologist so i was

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
allowed to do some research in delft

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
university

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
and um

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
and some of you may know me from a

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
presentation on the sarskoff ii vaccines

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
which was read by

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,439
1.7 million people

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,640
it's an interesting thing that means

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
that a lot of people really really care

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
but i've never written anything that was

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
read by 1.7 million people so

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
apparently we want to know about this

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
dna stuff

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
i also managed to fool some magazines

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
into publishing my research

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,960
but but it's for real and it's sort of a

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
joke i fooled them now this is real

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,079
research and it turns out that if you

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
are

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
thinking like a reverse engineer if you

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
are thinking about big data sets you can

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,280
go to dna

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
and invent stuff that other people have

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
not seen before

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
so and you you could do that if you had

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
oodles of free time

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
but then you could do that

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,759
so i'm going to talk about

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
manipulating dna but i want to make it

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
very clear that i'm talking here about

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,520
the technology i'm telling how it works

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,599
i'm not here to tell you hey you should

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,560
all go out and hack your dna or your

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
dog's dna or your

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
partner's dna dough don't do it and i'm

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
also here to pour a little rain on the

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
parade where you might have gotten the

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
impression that we have crispr now and

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
you can just crisper dna in any way you

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
want and it will do what you want and

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
no it doesn't

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
so

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
that was the bad news the good news is

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,680
that some really cool things really are

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
happening but we are not about to be in

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
a place that

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,840
you could modify and modify my dna and i

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,239
would become thin

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
you could however modify my dna and i

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
would be dead

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
that's entirely possible

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,959
let's not go there

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,760
so dna

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
millions or billions of nucleotides or

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
bases

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
so we we all exist

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,040
contain around 3.3 billion bases of dna

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
that's what we always thought later we

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
found out that some people have like six

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
percent more dna than other people

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
there's a lot more variation between us

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
than we thought this is relatively

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
recent discovery

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
and while our binary stuff is zero and

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,959
one

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
in dna we have four molecules and we

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
call them a c g and d and these are

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
organized in chromosomes and cream genes

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
and what blows my mind and it should

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,879
blow your mind as well and if it doesn't

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
blow your mind i will give you free beer

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
we have four billion years of life

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
and it is all using atom for atom the

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
same dna

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
now when i look back at my presentation

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
five years ago

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
i already could not read some of the

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
files i had made because by the time the

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
software had changed

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
this is four billion year old code

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
and it's still using the same molecules

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,799
if that doesn't excite you i don't know

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,200
what will

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
so there are some more analogies we have

111
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,480
dna

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
dna is like super stable

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
we sometimes can dig up neanderthals or

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,120
other ancient

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
organisms like a hundred thousand years

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
ago and we can still read their dna i

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
cannot read the cd-rom from 10 years ago

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
um which contains less information

119
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,280
so that is like super super solid stuff

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
but it's so solid that like a cd-rom it

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,199
doesn't do anything by itself so there's

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,400
rna which is a far more active form of

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,560
dna but it degrades in days or hours

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
and from rna we build proteins

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
we are all proteins we are a room full

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,840
of proteins our skin our proteins our

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
hair uh our nails etc so we are built

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,120
out of proteins but the proteins also do

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
stuff

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
that's really the doing things of life

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
the components of life and these are

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,800
made out of amino acids which are like a

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
little lego blocks

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,280
and you put them together and you get a

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
protein

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,919
so how much dna is there

137
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,840
and this is a sort of impressive list we

138
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,639
have viruses like that are 800 bytes

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
these are true artists

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
there's 800 bytes that can make you

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
really ill and unhappy

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,919
and and then of course there is the

143
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
famous one sarskoff ii 7.4 kilobytes in

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
the room with us right now

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
i'll almost guarantee it to you 7.4

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,759
kilobytes it costs a little bit of

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,440
disruption

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
um

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
then we go up to a bacterium 750

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
kilobytes which is sort of doable you

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
can read the bacterium and people

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,639
actually sort of go through all of the

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,560
dna for bacterium and learn stuff and

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
we'll also do that later on

155
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,120
and a typical human being is 750

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
megabytes

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
and that goes for everyone even if you

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
are larger it's still 750 megabytes of

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
unique dna

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,080
so how do we go from dna to these

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
proteins that build us

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,639
and that's this little machine this is

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
the world's most impressive 3d printer

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
this is the ribosome

165
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
and you see this chain that goes in that

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
says

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,280
that's not really that way and that goes

168
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
through

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
and that assembles the yellow

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,800
things that attract the purple or pink

171
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
amino acids that make these proteins

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,520
biologists are sometimes very strange

173
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
people when the protein is small they

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,960
call it the peptide

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
and no one knows when it becomes a

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
protein

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
this is how they roll

178
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
and

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
they love messing with you i'll get

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
some more examples of that so this

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
little machine is a 3d printer or

182
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
actually it's a 1d printer because it

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
takes this ribbon of rna

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
and turns it into a ribbon of amino

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
acids and then interestingly this ribbon

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,280
self-assembles and folds itself up into

187
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,799
all kinds of interesting shapes

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
there was a lovely movie here ah there

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
is a lovely movie here that you can see

190
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
but i cannot

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
let's see if i can make it play

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
yes it works but this is the same thing

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,880
in black you see this rna chain going

194
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
through the machine

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
and all these things fly in and out they

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
bring the amino acids and you see that

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
gray thing coming up there and that is

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
the amino the amino acids being

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
assembled into a peptide or a protein

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,199
and this just goes on and on and if you

201
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
watch this presentation at home it goes

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
on for multiple more minutes because all

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
kinds of cool things so now the thing

204
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,599
flies in

205
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
let's see does it come

206
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,199
ah

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
well it's taking its time

208
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
okay you should just watch this at home

209
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
you go whoop what it just goes on and on

210
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
and this happens within you right now

211
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,440
even as we speak

212
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,639
billions of proteins are being assembled

213
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,919
now

214
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,919
how do we know

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,879
how does the thing know

216
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,840
yeah is it working yeah it's working

217
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
this is the instructions

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,000
for an important protein and it actually

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
fits on one screen

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
and

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
and when this is made

222
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
and then another protein is also made

223
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
and if you want to impress biologists a

224
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
protein always starts with an m so if

225
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
you ever see one that doesn't start with

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
an m you can say like you're wrong mr

227
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
biologist it's this little trick

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
so here's another protein it's a bit

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
smaller and when these two assemble they

230
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
combine into one of the most impressive

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
materials known to man i have it here

232
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,600
for you

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
human skin

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
which if you think about this is a

235
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
really impressive piece of technology

236
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
can stand water it doesn't tear it

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
disinfects itself

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
and the source code for a key part of

239
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
that is on these two screens

240
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
continues to blow me away

241
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
so

242
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
this is a table of the op codes

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
of an ancient cpu

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
this tells you if you put these bytes

245
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
into this cpu it will do the following

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
things

247
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
if you look at this table

248
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
you can already see that some thoughts

249
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
went into that so there are all

250
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
columns that are empty where the

251
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
designers were probably planning to do

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
new things but they left space

253
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
and in some places they left a little

254
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
bit of room in between so you can see

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
some sort of structure in there if you

256
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
study this you might understand

257
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,320
something about the people that made the

258
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
6502 cpu

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,920
we have this

260
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,600
2300 year old rock

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
and on this are

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,080
is one

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
boring document written in two scripts

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,399
of egyptian and ancient greek

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320
and because it's the same document three

266
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,839
times this stone helps us understand how

267
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,600
language developed

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
maybe three thousand years ago 2300

269
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,200
years ago it's a very impressive rock

270
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
this is the table that does dna and

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
amino acids and it's 4 billion years old

272
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
this is a lot cooler than the rock

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
if you stare at this thing

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,160
the more you learn about this table so

275
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
we see for example that uh cgg maps to

276
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
argonine

277
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
and you have these other few things

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,800
there are t a a t a g and tga map to

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
stop codons that means the protein ends

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
here stop whatever you were doing you're

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
done

282
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
there are three of them

283
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,399
probably very important

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
the more you stare at this table the

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,640
more you start to see structure in there

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
and some people are really convinced

287
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
that someone designed this table

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
i don't think it was designed by someone

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,079
but still

290
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
the more i look at this table the more

291
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
sort of impressive it becomes

292
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
how do we know that it's 4 billion years

293
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
old

294
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
we can actually trace the evolution of

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
life we now think that it started in

296
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,040
these sort of black smokers or some

297
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
something close to that

298
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,680
but we know from the way this split up

299
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
that the code has not changed for at

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
least 2 billion years and probably

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
longer

302
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
i find that impressive

303
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
now finally we're going to talk about

304
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,160
hacking the genome and editing dna

305
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
why would you even do it because if you

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
mess with it you might make worse

307
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
well first there are people walking

308
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
around and they have terrible diseases

309
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,399
probably some of you in the room have

310
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
that and you would like

311
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
to have that fixed

312
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,519
and sometimes we just know there's this

313
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
little bit of dna that's wrong

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
if only we could change one thing your

315
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
life would be a lot better

316
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
but we also have people walking around

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
with unfavorable dna that we know that

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
you are at risk or maybe at risk of

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
severe disease later in life you might

320
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,279
not want to be at risk of severe disease

321
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,760
disease later in life

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
the other way we manipulate dna

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
is to get bacteria to work for us for

324
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
free there are our angels that way

325
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,399
and

326
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
we haven't got these bacteria to make

327
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
vaccines hormones and medicines for us

328
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
all the sarcophagus ii vaccines that we

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
got against corona

330
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
almost all of them came out of bacteria

331
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
which is very nice of them because

332
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
usually we associate bacteria with bad

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
things happening this is one of the good

334
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,240
things happening

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
we might one day also convince bacteria

336
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,160
to fixate

337
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
carbon dioxide for us which would be

338
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,920
really nice because they can do that

339
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
kind of thing if only we could tell them

340
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,399
that they should do it and maybe one day

341
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,959
they'll listen

342
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
we also can manipulate dna to

343
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,360
instruct our immune system to fix cancer

344
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
is nice

345
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
and finally that's the part where it's

346
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,279
going to be very active you could also

347
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
win the tour de france

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
if you want to modify your own dna and

349
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
there are also going to be people that

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
need bigger body parts and would like to

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
manipulate their dna

352
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,959
and it's probably going to be happening

353
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
don't do it

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
so what could go wrong with dna

355
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
sometimes there's just a typo in there

356
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,639
one thing changed it's just one letter

357
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,800
should be a c it's a g and that could

358
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
already disable a whole gene

359
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
or

360
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
it could the gene could still work but

361
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
now do the wrong thing

362
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
the other thing that sometimes happens

363
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
is there are people that come from

364
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
regions where there was lots of malaria

365
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
and they have dna that protects them

366
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,800
against malaria which is nice

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
that dna might also give you a blood

368
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
disease which is not nice

369
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
but it was a good trade-off when these

370
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,600
people lived in or their forebears lived

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
in countries with a lot of malaria

372
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
one of the most terrible things that we

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
recognize as computing people is let's

374
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
say you have a serial connection serial

375
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,519
connection

376
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
and you miss one bit

377
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
and everything now shifts one bit

378
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,560
that means that it becomes

379
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
unintelligible nothing useful ever comes

380
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,480
out again

381
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,079
dna has the same

382
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,399
issue because it takes three dna letters

383
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,959
to make one amino acid if you take away

384
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,720
one amino acid

385
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
all sorry one dna letter all the amino

386
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
acids now shift and they all become

387
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,839
wrong this is very bad

388
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,000
and sometimes you just get a mutation

389
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that means that the gene stops in the

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
middle which is not good because you

391
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
were attached you also wanted the rest

392
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
of it to work

393
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
so how long have we been

394
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
working with

395
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,360
modifying genomes

396
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
it turns out we've been doing this for

397
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
thousands and thousands of years already

398
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,040
which was not what you might be

399
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
expecting

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
and for example this this wonderful wolf

401
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
entered our lives

402
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,160
and

403
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,839
that thing downstairs is still

404
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
substantially a wolf

405
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,320
it's actually 99.9 wolf

406
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,639
i did not improve

407
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,920
i think

408
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,639
but we were able to do this because

409
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,120
there was enough genetic variation in

410
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
the wolf

411
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,880
that if you just sort all the sort of

412
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
good bits or the the

413
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
bad bits from the wolf

414
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
you end up with that thing so that's not

415
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
changing dna it's just moving it around

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
the same thing we see all these lovely

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,800
and healthy vegetables on the right

418
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,959
these are all one plant

419
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,680
so

420
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
the brussels sprouts and the kale and

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
the broccoli and the cauliflower are all

422
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,519
one plant

423
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,240
except someone bred it to emphasize

424
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
different parts of the plant but this is

425
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
if you have a dna sequencer at home

426
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,399
which i do

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
you could sequence your brussels sprouts

428
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
and they would look look just like

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
broccoli

430
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,399
so

431
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,079
this stuff all happened

432
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
thousands of years ago and it did not

433
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,399
require any special laboratory stuff it

434
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
just required sorting the variation that

435
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,639
existed

436
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
between the majestic wolf

437
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
so you take the smallest wolf from the

438
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
litter you take the nicest wolf from the

439
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
litter and in the end well you end up

440
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,839
with that

441
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
and um

442
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
there's a lot of variation

443
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,199
in here and i'm going to skip a few

444
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,839
slides but this is a real picture and

445
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,000
that sort of embodies the

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
genetic variation

447
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
within cows it is a real picture but it

448
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
must be said that the smaller ones are

449
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
all female cows and the big one is a

450
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
steer but still it's a very big cow

451
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
and uh and this is just not manipulating

452
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,600
dna just moving it around

453
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,730
skip this one as well

454
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,830
[Music]

455
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,399
actually so when people were breeding

456
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,480
plants sometimes there was not enough

457
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
genetic variation in the plant to make

458
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,120
an interesting plant people were bored

459
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
they had lots of time and no regulation

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,519
and at some point someone figured out

461
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
that if you just put some radioactivity

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,880
next to a plant

463
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,199
it will mutate

464
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,199
and this creates some lovely flowers and

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
this has been done for for decades

466
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,599
already and i think there are like 2 000

467
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
different plant species that were just

468
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
generated by putting radiation into them

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
and hoping that the plant would become

470
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
better

471
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
and uh

472
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
it works don't do this on people

473
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
um

474
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,199
they don't like it

475
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,880
so this was like

476
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,520
extra super super special

477
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
diabetic people people with diabetes

478
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
many of them need insulin

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
and the insulin hormone is a very small

480
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
protein it should be simple to make and

481
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
we cannot do it it's very interesting we

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
cannot do it we need to get

483
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,039
animals to do it for us

484
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,559
before 1979 or even before 1995 if you

485
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,480
wanted to make insulin you had to

486
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,960
slaughter hundreds of thousands of cows

487
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
and pigs

488
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
to get a tiny bit of insulin from them

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,520
which was wasteful and smelly and it was

490
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
not good

491
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,000
and they didn't like it and

492
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,160
ridiculously early these people

493
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
before they could even read dna they had

494
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,520
figured out how they could make the dna

495
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
that creates protein

496
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
and put it in bacteria

497
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
and these bacteria then said oh well we

498
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
still speak the language after 4 billion

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
billion years we understand your dna

500
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
humans we are now going to make insulin

501
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,799
for you

502
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
at first they only made a little bit of

503
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,480
insulin until they understood that

504
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
bacteria do speak the same dna but they

505
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,039
have a different dialect

506
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,799
and by that i don't mean they speak a

507
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,559
different language just they use

508
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,880
different synonyms so where

509
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
animal dna uses a lot of gcc as a codon

510
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,039
maybe the animals of the bacteria use a

511
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,240
different one

512
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
and in a ridiculously short amount of

513
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
time they could stop slaughtering these

514
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
hundreds of thousands of animals and now

515
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
insulin gets made by bacteria and

516
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,039
sometimes by yeast

517
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
it's like very impressive but how do you

518
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
do that how do you get the bacterium to

519
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
take your dna

520
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
and listen to it

521
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
it turns out

522
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,280
bacteria also have sex

523
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,240
so it's

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,679
nasty enough to know already that we are

525
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,280
sort of inhabited by bacteria but

526
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
they're also

527
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,880
doing things with their pelas

528
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
and um

529
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,919
and and

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,840
this means that if you get a bacterium

531
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,799
in the right mood it will just suck up

532
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,039
dna from the environment

533
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,799
and you are not going to believe this

534
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
but i swear it is true

535
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
with one of the most used bacteria for

536
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
this kind of stuff one way of getting

537
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
them in the mood

538
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,440
is to feed them alcohol

539
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
it really is true

540
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
the biologists continue to mess with you

541
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
once they have found a bacterium that is

542
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
willing to take up dna from the

543
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
environment by feeding it alcohol for

544
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
example they call it competent

545
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
which is not what happens to me when you

546
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,320
feed me alcohol but anyhow

547
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
you give there are other ways to get

548
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
them but this is one of the prime ways

549
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
to give them ethanol and they suck up

550
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,480
dna from the environment and they think

551
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,039
like hey let's do this stuff

552
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,960
okay so that's very nice because these

553
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
things make hormones for us medicines

554
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
vaccines so thank you

555
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
adding dna to humans because we'd love

556
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
to hear about human beings how can we

557
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
fix our dna how can we improve our dna

558
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760
and the thing is there are lots of

559
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
viruses around that already want to

560
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,520
improve our dna

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
and we do not want that

562
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,799
we are against that so our dna is very

563
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
well protected has lots of defenses

564
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
against people messing with it but there

565
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
are a few viruses that can do it

566
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
and one of the most famous one is hiv

567
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
the one that gives you aids

568
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,520
it's like really good at inserting stuff

569
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
in our dna

570
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
and so they started making medicines and

571
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
stuff with that but people were like are

572
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
you injecting aids into me

573
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
so they now call them lentivirus

574
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
which is the same thing

575
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,159
but it sounds a lot better so if someone

576
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,480
says this is a lentiviral based approach

577
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
you're like that's aids right

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
but but still of course they took out

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,159
all the scary bits and stuff so it works

580
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,120
but um but still what this does is you

581
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
take some dna that you want to insert

582
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
into a human being you put it into this

583
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
lentivirus and that then goes to your

584
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
genome and puts its stuff

585
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,559
somewhere

586
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,120
that's a bit of a problem

587
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
there are other viruses that do it

588
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
slightly smarter there's a

589
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,600
mysterious adino associated vector that

590
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
we don't really understand why it exists

591
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,000
at all but is a virus that takes a

592
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
little bit of dna and just leaves it in

593
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
the nucleus doesn't insert it just

594
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,039
leaves it there which is like very nice

595
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,240
and

596
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,600
and then another way of doing it that

597
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
was very disappointing to people they

598
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,120
said it's going to be like super hard to

599
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,360
get dna into a human cell

600
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
and to integrate it and someone said can

601
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
we try a really small injection needle

602
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
no it's not going to work

603
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
okay it does work

604
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
and um so this is

605
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
that that works as the way you think it

606
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,679
works just

607
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,240
someone with really good eyesight and

608
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
and it works but the problem is that

609
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,240
person can only do one cell at a time

610
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
and um

611
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
to improve that they also these these

612
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
biologists they cracked me up they they

613
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
made a gun a dna gun

614
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,559
and they and and they put little gold

615
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,600
balls in there coated with dna and go

616
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
and it's called biolystics

617
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
and um

618
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
so that helps because that can do like

619
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
like dozens of cells at the time

620
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
but the problem is we we need to do a

621
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,440
lot more than that and the challenge we

622
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,799
have there it looks a little bit like

623
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,640
this these are so-called phone books

624
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
there were massive data leaks when when

625
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
sort of

626
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
telephone companies would print

627
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
everyone's phone numbers in there

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
and you can see this is a lot i estimate

629
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,799
that each of these books contains around

630
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,039
200 megabytes of information which is

631
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,039
slightly less than the human being but

632
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
the challenge of editing human dna is

633
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,039
that you must search and replace

634
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,640
through these books and through all of

635
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
them

636
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,720
and you can see that it's going to be

637
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
real work

638
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
nevertheless we can do it

639
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,200
um sickle cell disease this is the one i

640
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
mentioned that if you have

641
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,799
this makes you almost immune against

642
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,360
malaria but can give you very nasty

643
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
blood disease and make make you

644
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
extremely unhappy

645
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
and this is now

646
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
i almost yeah i think this is fixed i

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
think we got this we got the solution

648
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,080
for it now

649
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
but the reason why it works is you

650
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,320
this is a rare case where you can take

651
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
cells from your blood out of the body

652
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,679
into the lab in the lab they infected

653
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
those cells with viruses they check it

654
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
everything went right

655
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
then they make a lot more of these cells

656
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
then you go back to the patient

657
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,159
remove those cells from the patient

658
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,240
that's the scary part for a bit

659
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,200
and then you put the fixed cells back in

660
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
and

661
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
it works

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,679
it works tremendously well it's also

663
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,400
tremendously hard work

664
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
but it uses one of these lentiviruses

665
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
and we know what that is

666
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,679
to insert a fixed gene and it mostly

667
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,240
gets inserted in the right place

668
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
mostly that's the sort of scary part so

669
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
how well does this work

670
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
these are on the left are people before

671
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,400
the treatment and every red

672
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
block there is a severe event where they

673
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
had to visit the hospital because their

674
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
sickle cell disease

675
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,520
got them

676
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,799
bad enough that they had to go to the

677
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,039
hospital and in yellow is the people

678
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,520
that have been treated and there are no

679
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
red markers there anymore now i have to

680
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,400
warn you you will read a lot about

681
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
successful gene therapy and most of the

682
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
successes are not that successful

683
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,919
most of the news is hyped up

684
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,760
this is for real

685
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
this is 100 score

686
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
maybe the light for five percent is

687
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that's okay but this is an extremely

688
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
impressive result where we were able to

689
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,440
just insert an improved gene and improve

690
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
people's life tremendously

691
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
this one is also very impressive cancer

692
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,600
we hate it

693
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
 cancer

694
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,159
the way cancer survives is that it hides

695
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,400
from our immune system if our immune

696
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
system could recognize the cancer cells

697
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,520
it would get rid of them

698
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
what we can do with gene therapy is

699
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
educate some of our immune cells and say

700
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
look this is what you should be doing

701
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
pseudo kill the cancer cell

702
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
and it actually does that

703
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,120
and

704
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
this is not as successful

705
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
as as this slide so we're not in this

706
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
territory yet and it doesn't work for

707
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
all cancers but when it works it's like

708
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
tremendously impressive and it worked

709
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
because we were able to tell an immune

710
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,799
cell here are your dna instructions this

711
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,960
is what you should look for

712
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
it's amazing

713
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,000
i'm going to skip this one because we

714
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,679
mentioned it already except for the last

715
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
paragraph this is a virus by which we

716
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
can insert a tiny ring of dna into a

717
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
cell it's very helpful from this virus

718
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
the biggest challenge is it's like

719
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
really tiny

720
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
that means that only a very small

721
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
payload fits in there that means if you

722
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
want to exploit it if you want to put

723
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
some shell code in there it has to be

724
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,559
like super super brief

725
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,440
finally crispr who here has heard about

726
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
crispr

727
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
yeah well it is nice it really is nice

728
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,919
because it allows me to show you this

729
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,840
picture

730
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
this is a bacterial virus called a phage

731
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,120
that's for real they really look like

732
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
this people are like is this an artist

733
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,159
impression

734
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,840
well the color is an artist's impression

735
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
i have to admit that otherwise this

736
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,559
bacterial virus actually looks like this

737
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,159
and to prove that on the right there is

738
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
a photo

739
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
it actually does look like that and how

740
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
does a thing like this operate in the

741
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,000
head there is a bunch of dna

742
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
and then it does what you think it does

743
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,200
it goes sits on the bacterium and then

744
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
drills down injects the dna so

745
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,960
it really does that and bacteria they

746
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,559
hate it

747
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,399
they really don't like that

748
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,360
and and they want to put a stop to it

749
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,240
so

750
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,679
many bacteria

751
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,799
have specific enzymes that recognize

752
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,520
specific dna sequences and when they say

753
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
when i see that dna sequence

754
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
i'm going to kill it

755
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,640
which is somewhat of a problem because

756
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
that means that the bacterium itself

757
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,279
should not have that dna sequence

758
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
because otherwise it would kill itself

759
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,760
if you do a simple statistical analysis

760
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,840
on any bacterium you find that they are

761
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,679
actively avoiding

762
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,440
some sequences because they know it will

763
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,399
kill them

764
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,640
so and by the way i this is my own

765
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
invention and and this you can do this

766
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,799
as well if you download dna from a

767
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,960
bacterium and you go hunt for rare

768
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,799
sequences you will find stuff and much

769
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
of that stuff is not really known in the

770
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,880
literature because they are not big

771
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,279
computer geeks over at biology

772
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,720
and we are

773
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,559
now crispr

774
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,039
and this is crispr has been around for

775
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,200
ages it has been around for billions of

776
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
years but we knew about it for a very

777
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
long time already

778
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
and the biologists and i love them by

779
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
the way i just want to clarify that but

780
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
they turned out their understanding was

781
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,600
exactly the wrong way around

782
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
because we knew that crispr was there we

783
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,600
could see it in bacteria but we didn't

784
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,679
know what it was doing

785
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,840
and what it looks like is you have

786
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
bits of yellow repeating dna they're not

787
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,320
yellow in real life but

788
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,960
repeating bits of dna with some random

789
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,720
stuff in between which they called

790
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,320
spacers

791
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,840
and everyone was really interested in

792
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,240
what are these yellow things doing and

793
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
and these spaces

794
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,240
it turns out the spacers

795
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,039
are

796
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,159
the immune system of the bacterium

797
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,159
these spacers

798
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
they have in be between them copies of

799
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,159
small parts

800
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,679
of the dna

801
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,640
from

802
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
the viruses that attack them

803
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,320
so in the dna there's an instruction

804
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
if you see

805
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,960
the following dna kill it

806
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,279
and this can evolve it can learn from

807
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,600
new phages

808
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,679
but the risk of course is if you have

809
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
this instruction if you see this dna

810
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,480
kill it

811
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,039
is that you start killing yourself

812
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,880
which is like a virus scanner that

813
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
detects itself because it's full of bad

814
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,399
stuff

815
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,960
and nature has been clever about this

816
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,320
it always adds a few dna letters before

817
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
the killing sequence

818
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
without actively mentioning them

819
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
this is how the bacterium

820
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,240
prevents itself from killing itself

821
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,960
it's like really nice

822
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
so what does crispr actually do and i'm

823
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,279
gonna skip a few slides but i'm

824
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,840
the key thing is you may think crispr is

825
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,919
a thing that edits dna that's probably

826
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
is that is that what your impression was

827
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
i think crispr yeah i think so as well

828
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
it doesn't it breaks dna

829
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
the only thing it does it breaks dna

830
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,480
that's what it does

831
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,159
so if you think like hey i'm going to

832
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,200
edit my genes with dna it's a bit like

833
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,399
i'm going to edit my genes with dynamite

834
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,720
i'm going to tear them apart

835
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,440
and the trick that we do

836
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,480
is we make the dna kill itself and

837
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,600
crispr

838
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,320
and then it's like really broken

839
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
and when it happens we also inject

840
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
sort of suggestion to the cell why don't

841
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,919
you fix it like this

842
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
and then the cell because it's like

843
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,320
super broken sometimes takes up our

844
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
suggestion and fixes itself so that's

845
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,039
really nice but if anyone tells you that

846
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,159
crispr is there to manipulate dna crispr

847
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
is only there to break dna

848
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
so

849
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,279
the hype around crispr

850
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
if you hear from california where people

851
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,720
are ready to crisper yourself into

852
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
health

853
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
we're not there yet we're not there in a

854
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,360
long

855
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,399
way

856
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,960
but in a lab it does work so you can do

857
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,679
many things with it in a lab

858
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,919
but you cannot just shoot the crisper

859
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
cannon at someone and hope that it

860
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,840
changes all your dna

861
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
and in fact when you do that if you

862
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
deliver

863
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,399
a crisper

864
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,880
payload if you inject it or whatever

865
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,399
your body goes like oh we need to break

866
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,440
this down

867
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
send it to the

868
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,440
liver which means that the liver is the

869
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
only place that we can really crisper

870
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
right now now it's a good thing that the

871
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,080
liver is one of your top 10 organs so it

872
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,919
is good news that we can add it there

873
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,440
but that's the only thing we can do with

874
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,519
it so it is not as hot as you would

875
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,279
think

876
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,320
now

877
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
more doom

878
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
do we understand how dna really powers

879
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,760
life

880
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,279
because if you're going to change it

881
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,000
it's best if you knew what it was doing

882
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
and sometimes we do and i really like

883
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,640
this one this is an important algorithm

884
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
should i go to the kitchen

885
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,640
i should go to the kitchen if i'm hungry

886
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
and if there is food there

887
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,919
that's an important human algorithm you

888
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:24,960
shouldn't go to the kitchen if you're

889
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,200
not hungry and you should also not go

890
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
there if there's no food

891
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,519
and in expressed in a sort of c like

892
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,559
language

893
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,320
if i'm hungry and there's food in the

894
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,399
kitchen go to the kitchen

895
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,000
we find this exact algorithm in bacteria

896
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
this is a piece of dna and if we are

897
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,679
hungry if the bacterium is hungry that

898
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,640
cap thing attaches to the dna

899
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
and it says can you please make this

900
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
protein

901
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,760
but that's only the first condition am i

902
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,120
hungry

903
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,399
the other condition is there actually

904
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,039
something we can do about the hunger

905
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
and that's when there is lactose around

906
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
if there is lactose around

907
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
then the bacteria says okay i'm hungry

908
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,679
there's lactose i'm going to convert

909
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,039
glucose

910
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,360
i'm gonna make glucose from the lactose

911
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,080
we understand this one really well

912
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,559
that's because bacteria are nice

913
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
bacteria are simple bacteria are like

914
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
these tiny computer programs that we all

915
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,799
rely on

916
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,120
human beings are these giant blocks of

917
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,679
java enterprise

918
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,120
and we have no idea what they're doing

919
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,880
[Applause]

920
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
we're all made out of java people and i

921
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,480
want to give you a real example

922
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,799
when we started to look at well when we

923
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
when the human genome was first

924
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
sequenced we thought we would find a

925
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,799
list of all diseases in there

926
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
so this is the gene that makes you fat

927
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,799
this is the gene that makes you smart

928
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,039
it works nothing like that and one of

929
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,720
the first things people try to figure

930
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,200
out is well what causes blue eyes

931
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
because it's a very simple thing to test

932
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
you can just look at someone do you have

933
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,720
blue eyes and then you can look at their

934
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
dna and see can i find in the dna what

935
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,799
gives you blue eyes or not

936
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
and lo we found it

937
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
we found a very powerful

938
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,480
mutation and it gives you blue eyes

939
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,320
so where is this mutation is it in a

940
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,199
gene that has anything to do with ice

941
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,679
no it is in the haircut2 gene which is

942
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,320
involved with dna repair

943
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,079
so there is a mistake or a change in the

944
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
haircut2 gene

945
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,918
and that gives you a different eye color

946
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,560
which makes no sense at all

947
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
then we found out that if you make this

948
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,839
small change in the haircut ii gene

949
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,760
the oka 2 gene becomes less active

950
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
well thanks for that

951
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,480
um

952
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,839
it's like yeah i only changed this

953
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,199
little thing and now the whole stack is

954
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,040
down i don't know why

955
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,159
but anyhow this tiny change in hair ii

956
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,639
suppresses the ochre two gene

957
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,599
what does the oca2 gene do well

958
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,400
it makes the p protein

959
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
what does the p protein do

960
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
we don't know

961
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,040
something something with color

962
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
it also changes some other things in

963
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,680
your life

964
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
in the color but we don't really know

965
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,640
so that means that this is our level of

966
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,920
understanding and this is actually one

967
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,839
of the best studied

968
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,359
mutations we have because it's one of

969
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,680
the first one that was discovered and it

970
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
is caused by a mutation in an unrelated

971
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
gene that suppresses a gene that we

972
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
don't really know what it does but it

973
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
gives you blue eyes

974
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,400
so be careful when you tinker with dna

975
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
strange things might happen

976
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,800
because this is the other pie chart

977
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,320
that tells us what is all the dna doing

978
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,040
and the red part the tiny part over

979
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,400
there that's the part that we are

980
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,359
reasonably sure what it's doing

981
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,320
and then there is stuff

982
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,200
and a lot of this stuff can be compared

983
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,160
to if you have an old computer project

984
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
and you have lots of files around and

985
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
you change it a few times there are now

986
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
three directories called misc

987
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
and um

988
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,680
and there's actually once once we

989
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
revamped it all but we didn't finish it

990
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
but we left the files around because

991
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,880
they might be useful later on

992
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
that's a lot of what you see in dna

993
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
a lot of the other parts you see in dna

994
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
so all kinds of viruses that have

995
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,119
successfully infected the dna have

996
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,200
meanwhile been killed but

997
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
yeah it's just we still keep it around

998
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
for some reason

999
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
there are a few plants that have cleaned

1000
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
up their whole genomes and kicked out

1001
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,960
everything that wasn't immediately

1002
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,560
useful and we have very much not done so

1003
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,400
but it turns out that these parts are

1004
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,440
important

1005
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,359
because if there are changes in there it

1006
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,680
turns out that we do change

1007
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,240
for example the the blue eye gene is

1008
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,320
actually in a part of a haircut ii that

1009
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,560
actually doesn't do anything

1010
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,000
but it does change your eye color

1011
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
the future

1012
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,839
will you hack a genome and will it be

1013
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,359
yours

1014
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,119
um

1015
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,440
is it loading yeah this is stuff you can

1016
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,079
buy online this is the bento lab on the

1017
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,240
left it's really nice

1018
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,400
mini pcr on the right

1019
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,079
this is pocket pcr this usb powered pcr

1020
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,280
machine you know from the dna tests

1021
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,440
you can just buy it and it's super fun i

1022
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
have all of these things and i've done

1023
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,599
my first dna experiments at home

1024
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,520
and i'm not even good at this kind of

1025
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,800
stuff

1026
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,440
but i was able to just detect dna and

1027
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
and and see what was in there and it

1028
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,400
works

1029
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
and you can just order this stuff online

1030
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,480
it's still somewhat special but

1031
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,240
the machine on the right

1032
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,400
is actually a dna sequencer that will

1033
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,839
read dna

1034
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,480
and it is actually this big

1035
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
and

1036
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
i pondered bringing it but then i

1037
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
thought about how stuff breaks on

1038
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
campsites so i didn't bring it but you

1039
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
can buy that thing and read dna in your

1040
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,880
own house

1041
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
if you want to order dna you can go to

1042
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
this site eurofins you can just paste

1043
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,079
the dna in there and click order

1044
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,160
and then they send it to you and then

1045
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,000
the billing process is extremely

1046
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
complicated

1047
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
i don't know why but the ordering of the

1048
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,960
dna is rather easy

1049
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
this is you can buy this thing crisp at

1050
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
home

1051
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
and it's meant for crispring plants so

1052
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,359
you can do some experiments with that

1053
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,880
stuff

1054
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
but you can order this and

1055
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,720
and do it

1056
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,200
so it is coming closer to our world

1057
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
um but don't do it because it will

1058
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,160
likely kill you

1059
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,640
or give you cancer so i'll just i want

1060
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
to as a disclaimer

1061
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
you can order this stuff but don't do it

1062
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,079
there are some people however that are

1063
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,680
willing to take risks

1064
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,119
and many of them are in the tour de

1065
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,560
france

1066
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,040
and um and there are a bunch of genetic

1067
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,640
modifications that you could make to

1068
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,400
your red blood cells that might very

1069
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
well improve your cycling performance

1070
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,119
and i think that these people

1071
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
also looked at this page like well you

1072
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,119
know

1073
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,960
if i don't win the next stage then

1074
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,119
what's what worth what's my life worth

1075
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,160
anyhow

1076
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,760
so but the only way you're going to

1077
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
figure that out is you if you actually

1078
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,920
sequence the dna from a tour de france

1079
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,640
cyclist and see that they changed

1080
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
and you're like hey you have new dna now

1081
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
so

1082
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,599
weird

1083
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,720
some predictions

1084
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,480
like i said you might get the impression

1085
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
that we can just simply crisper your

1086
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,280
hair color

1087
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,079
soon and probably not

1088
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,839
but the stuff from the sickle cell

1089
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,400
disease and this pseudo killer cancer

1090
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,119
cell stuff that is going extremely fast

1091
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,040
right now and that spent like 10 years

1092
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,720
in the lab but it's now coming out of

1093
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,560
the lab and actually curing people so

1094
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,520
you'll be hearing a lot more about that

1095
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
and but we will continue to focus on

1096
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,599
terrible disease because we're not quite

1097
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,560
ready yet to modify someone's dna so

1098
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
that they get a bigger

1099
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,839
nose or whatever

1100
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,440
in the future

1101
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,280
you might get you might enter the

1102
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,440
territory that people say we can change

1103
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
your dna because it will lower your risk

1104
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,079
of future disease

1105
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,599
and that might be something that is

1106
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,599
worth it for for some people but this is

1107
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,359
already like 10 years in the future

1108
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,530
and um

1109
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,599
[Music]

1110
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,880
but the thing is so these are

1111
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
developments for like the next 10 years

1112
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,240
but i'm a bit worried about the lower

1113
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,560
line because this technology is now so

1114
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,000
widely known

1115
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,920
uh there might be people not only tour

1116
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
de france people or just people with

1117
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,800
very scary diseases that have hope

1118
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,560
and of course the hope is

1119
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
we want to give people hope but

1120
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,880
it is now easy enough to to mess up

1121
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,680
uh your dna

1122
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,160
so summary we can make bacteria sing and

1123
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,440
dance for us if we give them a little

1124
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
bit of alcohol

1125
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,720
and uh and they make things for us which

1126
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,400
is nice we can fix dna cells in the lab

1127
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,319
and that has saved the lives of many

1128
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,839
people now because i could not even

1129
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,359
address all the ways in which this has

1130
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,480
worked

1131
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,880
it is a lot harder to fix

1132
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,560
a living human being

1133
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
but there are viruses that are willing

1134
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,319
to help and it might well be that in the

1135
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,720
future we find a virus that is precise

1136
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,119
enough that will deliver a fixed gene in

1137
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,560
the right place because right now it

1138
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,359
delivers it somewhere

1139
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,280
we understand very little about what

1140
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
most of dna does

1141
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,760
and we should be very careful tinkering

1142
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
with that and the final line is really

1143
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,560
your digital skills

1144
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
are really welcome in this field

1145
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,079
so

1146
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,880
if you study dna it is entirely possible

1147
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
as an outsider with only a few years of

1148
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,079
hard work

1149
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,480
uh to actually discover something that

1150
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,160
other people haven't seen because we are

1151
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,880
not scared of like hundreds of gigabytes

1152
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,240
of dna and uh and we have a reverse

1153
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,000
engineering mindset

1154
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,680
uh that can very well be helpful

1155
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,079
and with that i would like to end my

1156
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
presentation and thank you for your

1157
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,319
wrapped attention

1158
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
me

1159
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:18,139
[Applause]

1160
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
excellent are there is even time for

1161
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,560
questions are there questions

1162
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,040
there are microphones in the middle and

1163
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,680
i can't really see if there is anybody

1164
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,580
there

1165
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,839
[Music]

1166
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,480
and otherwise if there are no questions

1167
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
please please if you have a question

1168
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,560
please walk to the microphone yes

1169
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,839
microphone one

1170
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,880
not working

1171
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,560
i think two plants or something or three

1172
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,040
in the plant it has gigabytes of

1173
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,560
can you please perhaps even move up

1174
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
because on the stream we won't have any

1175
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,920
audio

1176
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,680
can you there's another microphone in

1177
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,000
the back

1178
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,240
that one does work yeah

1179
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
yeah so in the presentation at some

1180
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,880
point you showed there were two uh life

1181
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,079
forms with

1182
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
one of them having three 33 gigabytes

1183
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,000
yeah

1184
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,760
you just crossed it

1185
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
yeah there the bottom two ones yeah and

1186
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,640
i was interested to find out why

1187
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,920
why so much

1188
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,400
that's an extremely good question and uh

1189
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
for the marbled lungfish people are not

1190
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,440
actually sure if it's only one fish

1191
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,160
it might be actually two fishes with one

1192
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,200
genome

1193
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,599
we're not really sure uh but the other

1194
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,920
thing is that

1195
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,839
there is a theory that says that the

1196
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,400
more dna you have

1197
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,440
the more variation you can harvest

1198
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,960
which means that you could see and this

1199
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,839
is an information theoretical approach

1200
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,480
that you can see dna as an antenna for

1201
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,960
harvesting potential information about

1202
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,319
improvements

1203
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,040
and in a way it might be good to have a

1204
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,560
lot of dna

1205
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,440
um

1206
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,839
it might also be

1207
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,160
accidents history biology is full of

1208
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,800
weird accidents and

1209
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
it is not unique so it's not 33

1210
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
gigabytes of unique dna it's lots of

1211
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,680
copies of the same dna

1212
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,560
but the honest answer is we don't know

1213
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,920
thanks and thanks for the great

1214
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,520
presentation

1215
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,400
there's a lineup yes next

1216
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,599
so hi uh so you're saying that we can

1217
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,800
help right and so in what specific ways

1218
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,119
would software engineering skills be

1219
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,680
useful like what specific things so i

1220
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
can give you a very nice example of that

1221
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,960
um

1222
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,720
there are sometimes that biologists they

1223
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,520
do

1224
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,680
research on five bacteria and they

1225
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,880
report well in these five bacteria

1226
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,280
the following restricted sequences are

1227
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,119
present and we write a whole paper about

1228
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,119
these five bacteria

1229
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,880
and you can read that paper

1230
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
you can go to the website of the ncbi

1231
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,440
which is the us agency that gathers all

1232
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,200
these genomes

1233
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
and repeat the analysis not on five

1234
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,040
bacteria but in 32 000 of them

1235
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,640
and we can do that because we know how

1236
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,560
computers work and if we want to rent a

1237
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,640
big one we rent a big one and suddenly

1238
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
you just amplified their work by a

1239
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,280
factor of thousands and probably find

1240
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,280
lots of cases where their hypothesis is

1241
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,000
correct but it is not correct and this

1242
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,240
is simply a matter of scaling up work

1243
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
that was very difficult for those people

1244
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,640
and that could be easy for you and then

1245
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,480
you would maybe learn something about

1246
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,640
bacteria that before that we just didn't

1247
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,560
know

1248
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,440
thank you

1249
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,560
hello sorry i missed most of the of your

1250
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,920
photograph

1251
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,720
but

1252
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,319
i'm imagining that

1253
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,160
when we managed to

1254
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,800
manage the climate crisis afterwards we

1255
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,480
should take care about plutonium and

1256
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
collecting it

1257
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
so and i imagine that we could create

1258
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,440
creatures or a food chain that would

1259
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,640
partially

1260
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,800
eat plutonium and collect it and that

1261
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,040
way

1262
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,760
collect it so we can harvest it and put

1263
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
it together in one place whatever and

1264
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,079
treat it somewhat some way which we have

1265
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,680
to invent

1266
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,520
um what's your thought about it is this

1267
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,040
is a scary scary thought for you

1268
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,119
that we could one day um create a

1269
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,000
creatures or even food chain

1270
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,640
for this specific um

1271
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,079
um eindhoven

1272
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:36,880
yeah

1273
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,200
so the question i think is could this be

1274
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,119
like really scary

1275
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,319
and could we for example make a

1276
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,960
bacterium that just eats plastic

1277
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,319
which would be nice for the bacteria but

1278
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,680
it would sort of suck for all our

1279
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,200
plastic things

1280
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,720
i think with plastic it would be very

1281
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,560
different to

1282
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,640
draw the barrier between plastic and

1283
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,720
non-plastic things so this would be very

1284
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,560
dangerous in my opinion i i think you're

1285
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,240
right and we're still struggling with it

1286
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
so the european union has really said

1287
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,760
that you need to get permission to do

1288
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,359
anything with gene so all this stuff i

1289
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,040
just described there's a ton of

1290
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,960
paperwork in the european union and not

1291
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,520
in the us i'm not convinced that the

1292
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,359
paperwork we are letting people do here

1293
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,119
is even good enough to make sure that

1294
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,880
nothing scary happens

1295
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
but just to we could talk about this all

1296
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
night but i'm pretty convinced that this

1297
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,040
stuff could be like really scary

1298
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,599
yes so don't do it so don't do it at

1299
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,839
home

1300
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,559
is there a last short question we have

1301
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,839
only time for one i i hope it's short i

1302
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,880
don't know um for your blue eye

1303
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,559
example you said there is some junk dna

1304
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,880
that normally does nothing yeah but in

1305
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,319
this case it does

1306
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,280
yeah so it obviously doesn't do nothing

1307
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,000
yeah my question would be how do we even

1308
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,280
determine which parts of the dna do

1309
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,760
nothing yeah so we don't

1310
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,839
there is one there's one answer to it we

1311
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,359
can take a cell

1312
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,359
and look at all the dna that is

1313
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,839
currently being converted into rna which

1314
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,359
means that it's active and then we check

1315
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,559
if we can find that rna in the dna

1316
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,359
and if we do you end up as one of the

1317
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,400
red protein coding thing

1318
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
or as the

1319
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,400
well

1320
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,319
no there's not it's not explicit here

1321
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,280
but

1322
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,280
we can only really know the stuff that

1323
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,440
we see that is active and for the rest

1324
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,240
we don't know what the influence is

1325
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,119
so

1326
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,559
and also i

1327
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,319
i sure if i said that it did nothing

1328
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,319
then i should not have said that it is

1329
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,160
stuff that we don't immediately know

1330
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,960
what it is for

1331
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
this concludes

1332
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,599
i think we have to conclude now because

1333
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,720
of the time

1334
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,119
thank you all yeah i'm around outside so

1335
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,960
if you have more questions you can just

1336
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,440
please please follow bad outside thank

1337
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,800
him again for this great call

1338
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,259
[Applause]

1339
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,440
you
