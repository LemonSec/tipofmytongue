1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,640
but now let's get to the uh the main

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
attraction here

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
so our next speaker uh is uh fleur from

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,840
lewiston

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,480
uh she is the uh cso for the uh for the

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
acm so basically this is the uh the

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,320
dutch

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
uh the netherlands authority for the

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,600
consumers and markets and she is also a

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
board member at the david day uh the

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
dutch institute for vulnerability

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
disclosure she's going to talk to you

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
about uh pen test reports and why they

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
don't get used

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
of course for me this is utterly

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
perplexing because uh you know

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
me and my team we spend an awful lot of

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,559
time

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
writing pen test reports and i'm

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
extremely curious

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,959
to hear the reasons why they might not

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,200
get used so

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
um i guess with that

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,439
i guess fleur if you uh would like to

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
come up

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
wonderful so uh with this i guess uh we

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,159
are just about on time so i am going to

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
hand things over to you thank you

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
melanie ryback of course

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,720
yay

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,320
my talk

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
a siso approach to panzersing

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,759
and why so many reports are never used

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,200
but first

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
let me tell you a little something that

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,560
happened to me

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,439
uh last year we had a pen test

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
at the

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,560
place where i work

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and we had this was actually a fully

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
digital pen test but for some

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
reasons i cannot tell you about right

44
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,920
here there was part of this pen test

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
that had to be on site so the pen

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
testers were actually in our office

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
doing their digital test

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
and one day they were walking down the

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,200
hall and they saw

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,319
this

51
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,599
our lockers

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
and these lockers are secured by pin

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
codes

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
and one of the pen testers jokingly said

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,239
to my security officer that was with him

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
you know why why don't you let me just

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,959
try you know just one let me try one

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,760
code on one locker just for shits and

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
giggles you know

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
and my security officer

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
unfortunately said

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,319
sure why not this sounds like fun

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
and the pen tester went off

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
chose a random locker went one two three

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
four enter and

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,599
of course the locker opened

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
and this turned out to be a locker of

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,680
someone quite important within our

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
organization who did not appreciate this

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
test very much

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,840
because scoping y'all but uh yeah

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
apart from of course the fact that it's

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
not a very smart move to have one two

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
three four as your code

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
it's very important to have a scope for

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
your test and stick to it for multiple

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
reasons which i'll get to it in a moment

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,040
uh first of all i'm just wondering i'm

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
gonna do a pull right here with you guys

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
um

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
because i've noticed that a lot of us

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,360
don't actually know this but managers

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
don't know a lot about iot generally if

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
unless they're it managers um

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
so what i did was i asked a random group

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
of dutch managers which i don't

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,599
personally know

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
who are not in i.t

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
which what what they thought the word

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
checksum meant and i just i was kind of

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
in a friendly mood so i gave them three

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
options i didn't ask them right out i

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
asked them um do you think it means

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
a digit representing the sum of the

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
correct digits in data which can be made

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
to detect errors spoiler alert of course

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
this is the correct answer or do you

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
think it means a sum of multiple

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
vulnerable systems that have been

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,920
checked for the same known vulnerability

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,120
over the course of multiple tests

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
or

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
they could say it's a way to check that

104
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,000
a computer system has not been hacked

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
recently

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,560
now for you guys i'm wondering what you

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,519
think

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
most of the managers thought

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
the word checksum means so i'd like you

110
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,080
to raise your hand if you think most of

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,759
the managers i asked think it's answer a

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,479
how many of you think

113
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
well have a little faith in your

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
managers people

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
uh how many of you think that the

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
managers thought it was the answer of b

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
right so that's for the viewers at home

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
that's i think about like 50 of the

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
people in the room

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
so probably the other half was going to

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
think they answered c right who thinks

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
it's c most people answer c

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
i'm actually going to give you the

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
answer of course but i'm going to give

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
it to you a little later in the

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
presentation all right so stick with us

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
um

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
who am i well

129
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
i'm the cso i

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,639
for the dutch authority for consumers

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
are markers we are a regulatory

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
authority in the netherlands we regulate

133
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
well consumers are markets and so we

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,400
make sure there's no

135
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
monopolies or that kind of thing in

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
markets like

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
like hospital care or energy markets or

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
that kind of thing

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
and i used to be the cso for difid but

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,639
now i'm a board member

141
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
and of course the ivd

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,000
we are

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
a group of volunteers that scan the

144
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
internet and

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
for mostly known vulnerabilities and try

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
to get the

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,280
people that are vulnerable to patch or

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
update or fix their systems

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
as well as

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
responsibly disclosing zero days or

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
helping people disclose zero days in a

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
responsible way

153
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,919
and um yeah we do that voluntarily

154
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
and i have a background in criminology

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and justice i have a master's degree in

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
criminology and i used to work for the

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
police in amsterdam

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,400
enough about me anyway

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
is it gonna work

160
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
so

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
let's talk a little bit about how pentas

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,039
are traditionally set up

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,479
first thing i want to say is of course

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,600
you all know this but there's a

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,759
difference between a pen test and a scan

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,400
like a scan is automated and i refer to

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
a pen test as a manual thing

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
like um

169
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
it's actually a person doing the test

170
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
it's not a script

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
i'm not saying one is better than the

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
other there are perfectly legitimate

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
reasons to go for a scan as opposed to a

174
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
pen test but in this presentation what

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
i'm talking about a pen test i mean a

176
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
manual pen test not a scan just to make

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
that clear

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
my experience is that most times when

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
you order a pen test from a vendor

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
the details are decided and proposed to

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
you by the vendor so the vendor is going

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
to tell you you have an office 365

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,599
application here i would suggest you

184
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,400
would test it for authorization

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
authentication that kind of thing so the

186
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
vendor will ask you as a cso

187
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,960
would you like this and this and this

188
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
tested as opposed to the cso saying i

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,800
want this and this and this test that

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,759
usually a cso just says i want my i

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
don't know sharepoint tested

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that kind of thing

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
and then usually the the pen testers

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
they do the test they make a report

195
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
and then the cso kind of translates that

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
report back to the board or management

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,319
because

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
they can't actually read the report

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,720
it's

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,319
blah blah to them

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
so you as a cso have to take the report

202
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,879
make sure you get the main findings and

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
then translate that in a language your

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
board or your managers understand to get

205
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
to make sure you get funding or you know

206
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,479
get everything fixed

207
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
and this is something that's not mine of

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
course as a pentester you've probably

209
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,360
heard that a lot but it's very very true

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
your test is as good as your report

211
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
you can have the most amazing pentas if

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
you cannot write it down in a way that

213
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
people understand there's really no

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
point nothing's going to happen with

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
your findings

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
so that's something i really wanted to

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,039
to emphasize here as well as the fact

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,919
that

219
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
there is really no point to having a

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,240
very shiny perfect report if there is no

221
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
actual follow-up now that's something

222
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,000
that's not your responsibility as a pen

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
test for most of the time

224
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
but

225
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
there are things that a cso can do to

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,599
make sure a pentas gets followed up on

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
so you can write a perfect report

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
but still if no one does anything with

229
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
it ends up in a drawer what's the point

230
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
so in my opinion there are some relevant

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
questions here how do you set up such a

232
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,760
good pen test as cso how do you write a

233
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
good report as a tester and how do you

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
work together to make sure it gets a

235
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
proper follow-up that would be the

236
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
optimum outcome

237
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
so

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
setting up a good pentas as a cso to me

239
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
means that you take the lead so you

240
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,640
handle a pentas like you would a project

241
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
you make sure there's a planning you

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
make sure there's a scope that you

243
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
decide on so it's not the vendor that

244
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
comes to you and says would you like

245
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,279
your sharepoint tested for

246
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
authentication issues or that kind of

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,399
thing or any you know

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
files that are hanging around in the

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
wrong places that's something you need

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
to discuss with the owner

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
inside your organization of sharepoint

252
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
to make sure that

253
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
that's actually what you want to get

254
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,519
tested maybe there are things that

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
happened in the past like certain

256
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
incidents that make you doubt certain

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
configuration

258
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,399
decisions

259
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,920
that might be something you want to get

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
tested so instead of

261
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
leaning back and letting the vendor tell

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,200
you

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
what you should test it should be more

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
proactive as a cso and make sure that

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,680
you decide together with the owner of

266
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
the application or the system what gets

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
tested

268
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
and you need to write that down so you

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
make a clear scoping document and then

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you're not even there yet you take the

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
scoping document you go to your pen

272
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
testers and you say can you do this

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
because it's great when you have

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
fantastic goals or you've written

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
everything down but if your pen testers

276
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
actually can't test that because they

277
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
don't have the tools or the knowledge or

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
whatever then

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
what's the point

280
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
so you're like a bridge between the pen

281
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,360
testers and the owner of the application

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
you make sure there's things arranged

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,079
for for the test to be you know carried

284
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
out and you make sure that the scope is

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
clear and it's doable

286
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,920
so

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
you need to make sure you have goals you

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
need to write them down

289
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
you also need to write down what

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
techniques are allowed are your pen

291
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,000
testers allowed to use social

292
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
engineering this sometimes can be

293
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
ethically

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
something to be discussed so write down

295
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
what is allowed but also write down the

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
limitations if you don't want them to

297
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
use certain tooling if you don't want

298
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
them to do certain things make sure you

299
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
write it down in advance so they know

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,399
and a few helpful tips

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
um add some technical details to your

302
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
scoping document so

303
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
a lot of the time these stats are either

304
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
white or gray box they're hardly ever

305
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
black box because you don't have that

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
kind of time or money when you do a pen

307
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
test if you want a true black box pen

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
test you usually go for bug bounty that

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
kind of thing so usually these things

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,399
are like a gray box anyway

311
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,920
i'm gonna get back to that in a little

312
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
bit so i like to add some architecture

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
drawings of course they are never

314
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
completely up to date because they never

315
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
are but you know whatever you can give

316
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
your pen testers as something to hang on

317
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
to it can be helpful and it can also

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
make sure they don't spend a lot of time

319
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,640
searching for things on the network

320
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,959
because they can just look it up

321
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,959
if there are certain settings in your

322
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
antivirus your ids ips that kind of

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
thing that might go off because usually

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
when you're pen testing

325
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
and it's not in a in a developmental

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,320
stage but it's an in production system

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,279
you don't really want all the anti-virus

328
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,040
alerts to go off and that kind of it's

329
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
just annoying

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,639
so sometimes it just helps to tell your

331
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
pants in advance if you do this then

332
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
that will probably happen uh you might

333
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
want to avoid doing that because

334
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
you know i t people are

335
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
humans too

336
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
so

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
um

338
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
like i said earlier what kind of tooling

339
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
you're allowed or not allowing

340
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
might be helpful and of course

341
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
boundaries and with boundaries i don't

342
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
really mean tooling but with boundaries

343
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
i mean network boundaries you don't want

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
your pen testers hacking into your

345
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
vendor's network because you're there's

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
your connection there or your neighbors

347
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
or whoever you want them to stay within

348
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,639
your own network but in order for them

349
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
to do that you need to tell them what

350
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
the boundaries are so which ip addresses

351
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
are within the limits of your network

352
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
and which ones if they spot that they

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
have to go

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,959
uh have to

355
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,639
go back here

356
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
and involve your a t apartment i think

357
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
sounds like very obvious but sometimes

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
people forget so the i.t department

359
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,680
doesn't know there's a pen that's going

360
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
on anti-virus alerts are going off

361
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
your your nice i.t admins are tearing

362
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
their hair out going what the f is going

363
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,920
on uh well a surprise pen test pentas

364
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,079
yeah you want to avoid that so i would

365
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,519
involve them i would tell them in

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,560
advance

367
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
we're going to do this test is this all

368
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
right do you have any large migrations

369
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
planned for this period for this

370
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
application might also be a valid

371
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
question to ask in advance

372
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
and even if you do that

373
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,760
like i did

374
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
sometimes it still goes wrong

375
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
i involved the i.t department very very

376
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
timely everything i even made sure that

377
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
the accounts that we gave to the pen

378
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
testers had very obvious names pan

379
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,480
tester one pen tester two

380
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
and then uh i always make sure i'm

381
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
available in the week that we do the

382
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
test because if things go wrong you know

383
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
people can call me so i got a call first

384
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,160
i got a call from the panthers going our

385
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
accounts are locked i'm like that's not

386
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,839
good

387
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
like five minutes later i get a phone

388
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
call from the it department we locked

389
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
their accounts i'm like

390
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
why

391
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,880
and they go well

392
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
they we spotted them downloading hackers

393
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,480
tools so we we yeah we disabled their

394
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
accounts because that's what we do in a

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
normal situation i'm like it's not a

396
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,399
normal situation these are pentesters

397
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
yeah but we blocked their account like

398
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
we're supposed to do i'm like that's

399
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
awesome what are they gonna do now go

400
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,760
home we paid them money to do this

401
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
so yeah

402
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,160
then they had to enable the accounts

403
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
again and fortunately it was around

404
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,279
lunchtime so the panthers could grab

405
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,680
lunch and then go back to work but you

406
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
know

407
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
even though you do this with the best

408
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
intentions sometimes it still goes wrong

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,160
some things you must never forget a

410
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,839
disclaimer i don't i don't really know

411
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
if this is the correct english word in

412
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,560
dutch i would say a freiberg

413
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,720
um so you need to make sure that there's

414
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
no legal action that's going to be taken

415
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
to your pen testers if they make

416
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
mistakes

417
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,480
for us we usually put in the disclaimer

418
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
that as long as they follow everything

419
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
in the scoping documents the disclaimer

420
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
is valid if they do anything that's not

421
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
in the scoping document

422
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,279
lockers

423
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
um

424
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
you know look at the draws

425
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
so to speak uh so in dutch we have a vog

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
for clan transgender if you work for if

427
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
you're a pentester for a government

428
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
organization we ask you to give us this

429
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,720
document it states that you have no

430
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
another criminal records that is related

431
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
to the work you're going to be doing for

432
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
us

433
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
but it's optional because it's not all

434
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,399
it's only for government

435
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,600
well it's not actually only for

436
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,279
government i believe it's you can ask

437
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
for it if you're in a company as well

438
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
but usually for government it's

439
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
mandatory

440
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
um of course you have you ask them to

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
sign a confidentiality agreement you ask

442
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
them to sign this because

443
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
um

444
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,639
like like if you have a responsible

445
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,360
disclosure this is kind of a wobbly area

446
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
you would not always

447
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
ask for a confidentiality agreement in

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
this case when it's a pentest however

449
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,279
you're paying people to do something for

450
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
you and you're also giving them

451
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
information as opposed to when it's a

452
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,759
responsible disclosure someone finds a

453
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
vulnerability somewhere in your system

454
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,839
and they found it independently but

455
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
we're actually telling the pen testers

456
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
things about our network our antivirus

457
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
settings our firewall settings our

458
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
parameter that kind of thing so you want

459
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,480
this to stay confidential so it's a

460
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
different kind of situation

461
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,600
and

462
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
when there's gonna be social engineering

463
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,120
on site make sure that you give them a

464
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,199
written statement with a signature i do

465
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,480
this for from the cio usually

466
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
because yeah it's kind of a hassle when

467
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
you have to go pick up your pen tester

468
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,240
from the police office so it's easier if

469
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,759
they have like a statement they can show

470
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,839
your security that they're supposed to

471
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
be trying to social engineer people in

472
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,120
the building

473
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,319
um which is why i i would give you this

474
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
tip

475
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
and then there's a little bit of boring

476
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
stuff if you have a larger test that is

477
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
spanning multiple days make sure you

478
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,319
have a planning like first day they

479
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,559
start here their goal is to reach this

480
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
point in the network or to like get

481
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
admin

482
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,400
that kind of thing make sure you plan it

483
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
out because you want to have as much

484
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
tested as you possibly can you're paying

485
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,679
for this test you want them to test

486
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
as many things as possible and of course

487
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,320
some practical arrangements so you need

488
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
to make sure that from it for like

489
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
timely in advance you give them access

490
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
passes password logins 2fa tokens that

491
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
sort of thing because these things

492
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,000
sometimes take longer than you think and

493
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
then this is what i was talking about

494
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
earlier why would you give a pen tester

495
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,960
credentials or two-factor authentication

496
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
you do this because

497
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,840
if you don't and you just tell them

498
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
hack this application i'm gonna give you

499
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
nothing

500
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
there's a chance that they're gonna

501
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
spend the entire week or whatever time

502
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
you gave them trying to get into the

503
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,640
system that doesn't mean your system is

504
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
secure

505
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
because an outside attacker has all the

506
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,720
time in the world to get in and your pen

507
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
tester only has five days so if your pen

508
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,799
tester had all the time in the world you

509
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,559
probably would have gotten in or she

510
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
anyway but they don't you only gave them

511
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
five days

512
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
so

513
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,880
that's why

514
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,440
in some cases i give the pen testers

515
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
credentials not to use immediately

516
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
that's why you need a planning so you

517
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
tell them day one you try and break in

518
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
from the parameter if you can't get in

519
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
in day one write down whatever you found

520
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
and how you think you would have gotten

521
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
maybe would have gotten in if you have

522
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
more time

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
then day two use user credentials lowest

524
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,559
type of

525
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
uh authentication authorization

526
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
see how far you get there and so on and

527
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
so on and so on because you have to

528
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
assume breach anyway you have to assume

529
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
that if someone has unlimited time and

530
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
money they would get through your

531
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
perimeter and um you want to make sure

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
that all the layers are tested not just

533
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
your parameter because it's a waste of

534
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
money otherwise

535
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,799
now for something a little different

536
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
i'm just wondering

537
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
who knows

538
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
what this word means

539
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
if you know what the word means you know

540
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
what it means you were first i saw it

541
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
maybe is it possible that you can use

542
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
the microphone can you use the

543
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,960
microphone and say what it means

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
no hello yeah go ahead another english

545
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
word for this

546
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,400
exactly or

547
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
more you know nuanced it's a language

548
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,960
that is meaningless or made

549
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
unintelligible by excessive use of

550
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
technical terms now a lot of pentesters

551
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,320
in their reports tend to use this type

552
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
of language for managers like i said in

553
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
the beginning checksum

554
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
might be difficult but what i asked the

555
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
managers that i also did the poll with

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
earlier i was like while they're here

557
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
might as well ask them some other stuff

558
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,360
i asked them what would you like to see

559
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
in a pentas report so now remember these

560
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,720
are non-it managers these are directors

561
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,679
board members that kind of thing they're

562
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
also not representative of all the

563
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
managers in the world they're just a

564
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
handful of dutch managers it's just for

565
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
fun but what they said was they at least

566
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,080
want the top three findings

567
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
they want a suggestion on the fixes of

568
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
these top three findings

569
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
they want a management summary

570
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
and they want a cost estimate of how

571
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
much they think you think it might cost

572
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
to fix this

573
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,799
and they're interested to know if this

574
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
whatever you found is being exploited

575
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
into the in the wild

576
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
none of them

577
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
wanted the whole technical story that

578
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,720
was an option they could choose

579
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
no one chose that option

580
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
they do not care which doesn't mean you

581
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
shouldn't put it in there

582
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
i'm gonna get to that in a second you

583
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
should it's just in a different way so

584
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
why are we writing reports this way why

585
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
are we writing reports in a way that

586
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,200
managers actually don't care about

587
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,360
because it's not aimed at managers we

588
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
write pen testing reports for technical

589
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
people we write them for the it

590
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
department we write them for the cso we

591
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,679
never write pen testing reports for

592
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
board or managers and that's why it's in

593
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,600
technical terms because it's meant for

594
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
technical people

595
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
but there's a very distinct language

596
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
difference there a lot of us think that

597
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
we know what managers know they think

598
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
certain words are

599
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,720
normal in everyday language which

600
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
actually aren't but we as technical

601
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
people tend to hang out

602
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
with technical people

603
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
that's our group of people that's our

604
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
frame of reference so that's our

605
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
language

606
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
um so we're kind of living in a bubble

607
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
and then csos are left to translate but

608
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,400
they're not always very good at that

609
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
and so that's not really an optimal uh

610
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
setup in my opinion because

611
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
the people that we write these penciling

612
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
reports for are not actually the people

613
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
that are the ones that make the

614
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
decisions or that have the budget

615
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
sometimes seasons have a budget i

616
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,159
personally don't i don't need it but

617
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
a lot of the times the people you write

618
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,520
the report for are not the people that

619
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
make the decision on what to do with

620
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
your findings

621
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
another problem that you kind of run

622
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
into a lot is that an internal cso's

623
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
opinion is valued

624
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
surprisingly less than an external

625
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,039
experts so when an external expert says

626
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,440
this is a serious problem

627
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
a board member or manager is more likely

628
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,280
to believe you than if a cso says it

629
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,799
because the caesar says it six times a

630
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,159
week

631
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,640
and the external expert is someone from

632
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
the outside and you know exotic and new

633
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
and you've never seen that person before

634
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
so if he says that it's serious then

635
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,039
it's probably something you should take

636
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,240
serious

637
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
and also caesars just sometimes don't

638
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,440
understand the reports or they

639
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
misinterpret findings and are just not

640
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
very good at translating sometimes

641
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
sometimes they're very good but

642
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
sometimes they're not

643
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,080
and this way you become a gateway

644
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
between the expert and the management

645
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
it's kind of like what you did in

646
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,480
preschool where you whisper a word in in

647
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
someone's ear and they have to whisper

648
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
it in a next person's here and the next

649
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,960
person's hearing at the other hand a

650
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
totally different word comes out that

651
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,559
kinds of stuff happens

652
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,039
and as a result your boards doesn't

653
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,480
always get to see or feel how serious

654
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,159
certain findings are because you're a

655
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,080
cesar and you're always yelling at them

656
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
that things are going wrong and we have

657
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,720
to do something right now and

658
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
they're they tend to be kind of right

659
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
they tend to get a little numb sometimes

660
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
which is something we need to fix but

661
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,960
hey i'm just saying

662
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,600
so how do you write better reports

663
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
like i said

664
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,559
a lot of them just want a management

665
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,640
summary a lot of pentesters actually do

666
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
this they write a management summary but

667
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
then the management summary is sometimes

668
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
10 pages long

669
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,159
which management managers tend not to

670
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,799
have time for so i would say make a

671
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,400
management summary that's

672
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
maximum one page

673
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,000
and make it so that you know it's

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
readable to them there's no

675
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
jargon no gobbledygook in your

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
management summary

677
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
uh make sure there's their top three to

678
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
five findings

679
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
and i'm not saying you shouldn't put any

680
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
other findings in i'm just saying not in

681
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,679
the management summary for the managers

682
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,080
just give them the top three of the

683
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,400
worst things that you found

684
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
and what is needed to fix them

685
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
and then have the rest of your findings

686
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400
in an attachment in technical terms

687
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
because eventually someone's going to

688
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,600
have to fix all these things so it's

689
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
important what you found how can we

690
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,919
replicate this

691
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
and you have to do this in technical

692
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,880
terms because you just can't get there

693
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,600
if you're talking like a toddler so

694
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
you're gonna have to

695
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,720
make sure that there's technical

696
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
information there but just put it

697
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
in the back

698
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,760
so that everyone can use your report the

699
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,840
managers can use your report the cso can

700
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
use your report and the technical people

701
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
that need to go fix these things can

702
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,760
also use your report

703
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,840
and at

704
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,679
screenshots uh and evidence because you

705
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
know it's just more fun to look at and

706
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
it makes it easier to replicate and it

707
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,039
scares the hell out of managers

708
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,080
um

709
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
and then the follow-up like i said it's

710
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
great you have this wonderful report you

711
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,679
had a great pen test

712
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,919
lots of wonderful findings

713
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,120
great report

714
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,600
but then the follow-up this is a job for

715
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
your cso

716
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,000
so

717
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,760
how do you get

718
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
the the follow-up done you need to make

719
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,799
sure

720
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,840
that

721
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,640
you

722
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
let the experts do the talking if you

723
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,799
can sometimes fan testers aren't really

724
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
keen on talking to board members but if

725
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,440
you estimate that they're you know

726
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,919
they're good at explaining what they did

727
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,240
have them have a presentation for your

728
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,080
managers and your board where they

729
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,159
explain themselves their top three

730
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,440
findings

731
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,720
um

732
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
have them talk it over with you in

733
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
before to make sure there's no difficult

734
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,520
words in there and

735
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
then have them do this this presentation

736
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
where they explain the top findings that

737
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
they did

738
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
and your board and your managers can

739
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
actually ask them questions

740
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
how did you do this why is this

741
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,480
important

742
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,559
that kind of thing

743
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,760
and then hammer them on their

744
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
responsibilities so tell them all right

745
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
we have this report we have these

746
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
findings you are the owner of this

747
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
application or you are the manager or

748
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,600
you are the board if we do not follow up

749
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
on this

750
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
and that's your decision i'm gonna write

751
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
you an email a memo or whatever and

752
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,559
please sign

753
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,880
sign that you decided not to follow up

754
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,520
on these things or

755
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,039
i'm going to give you an advice on how

756
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,760
to follow up on it and then please

757
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,960
uh say that you want this followed up on

758
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
like in in writing and then we'll get it

759
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
followed up on

760
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,559
and like i said have the experts explain

761
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,120
so the presentation is not finished yet

762
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,799
i'm still going to give you the answer

763
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,720
of the poll in the beginning and some

764
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
main points but up until now are there

765
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,918
any questions

766
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,559
i'm just coming back on stage to help

767
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
with your english

768
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,360
so anyone who has a question feel free

769
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
to line up at the microphone another

770
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,799
thing also

771
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
those of you who are watching online can

772
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,399
also

773
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,360
send in questions so also for the signal

774
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
angel do we have any online questions

775
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
yet nope

776
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,720
okay great go ahead

777
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,760
yes you said you write your reports in

778
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
we should write our reports in two

779
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,760
levels a business level and a technical

780
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
level i'd like to write my reports in

781
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,520
three levels i start with my management

782
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,039
summary which is totally business

783
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
language

784
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,279
as little technical words as possible

785
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,320
not even say vpn no the network of the

786
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
company

787
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
and then when i start writing my

788
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,840
findings my individual findings always

789
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
like write a

790
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
user story kind of thing so

791
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,919
as an attacker that is able to connect

792
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,279
to the network

793
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,600
i can steal your data

794
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,320
so you can explain what is the risk

795
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,720
uh with each finding separately so if a

796
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,799
manager like starts flipping through

797
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,640
the findings itself they can see oh

798
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,919
there's a risk of people stealing data

799
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,200
stealing money

800
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
exposing our secrets to the internet

801
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
things that and then they're going to

802
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,360
start on with all the technical details

803
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,399
yeah that's very good yeah i would say

804
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
do that as well i

805
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
i didn't really mention it but i kind of

806
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,840
assumed that's something you would uh

807
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,200
follow up on after the management

808
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
summary so it's not a management summary

809
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,200
attachments it's management summary and

810
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
then you kind of elaborate exactly like

811
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,360
you said maybe not in a user story that

812
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,000
kind of that's a taste thing but

813
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,200
elaborate on what does it mean that we

814
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
found this thing yeah that's that's

815
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
perfect yeah

816
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,440
go ahead oscar

817
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,039
how do you deal with how do you deal

818
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,360
with the situation that managers push

819
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,320
the document the report back to you as

820
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,399
the expert or the i.t people because

821
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,320
they are responsible for the

822
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
infrastructure how do you deal with the

823
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,600
situation where the managers are just

824
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,760
pushing it back to you again

825
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
well they they really can't because what

826
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
what happens is there's a pen testing

827
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,159
report they get the presentation

828
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,080
where you know there's there's

829
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,399
explanation about what was found and

830
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,600
then they get

831
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,080
advice on how to fix it and they and we

832
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,919
tell them to make a decision so i

833
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,919
usually what i usually do when we have a

834
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,279
pentas report

835
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,320
i take the the most important findings

836
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
of course the the little findings that

837
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,919
like the quick fixes we don't even

838
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,679
discuss those i just give them to the it

839
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,440
department and i go please go fix this

840
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,600
and they'll fix it it's quick dirty easy

841
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
whatever but the the main find is the

842
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,120
big ones i usually go to the managers

843
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,559
and i give them an advice and i give

844
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,440
them usually two options so for example

845
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,679
we had a phishing vulnerability and i

846
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
said you can put a vpn before this

847
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
portal or you can put very serious

848
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,799
monitoring on it or both preferably both

849
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,480
but

850
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,120
give them options because i my

851
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
experience is managers and board members

852
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,039
they like to have something to choose

853
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,880
not too much because then it gets too

854
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
hard but give them options to choose

855
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
from and then you force them to make a

856
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,000
decision they can't really say well let

857
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,720
the i.t department decide this because

858
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
what i would say is they can they can't

859
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,159
make that decision because they need

860
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,559
money or they need uh

861
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,919
people or whatever something is needed

862
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,840
more than we have right now in order to

863
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,279
fix this a vpn costs money uh it team

864
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,399
cost money

865
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
so they can't really push it to the i.t

866
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
department because it's

867
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
not their

868
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,959
field of decision making

869
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,480
go ahead

870
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,600
henry hendrick i have a small question

871
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,320
but it's a bit the position of the seso

872
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,918
and the pen test inside the organization

873
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,679
to give you slightly an id in the late

874
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,840
1980s i was in delft university and i

875
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,799
had to

876
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,200
approve of with some people

877
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
on an uh military rate attack on the

878
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,399
nuclear reactor that's a very rough kind

879
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
of pen test

880
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,840
what kind of department who's

881
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,080
designing the doing the pen tests

882
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,120
is there what's the cso is it is general

883
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,679
security or is it i.t

884
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,039
that's a very good question actually i

885
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,640
think it depends on the maturity of your

886
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,919
organization

887
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,240
so the organization where i'm working

888
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,399
right now we still have a ways to go

889
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,279
which is normal because we're government

890
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,919
but so i kind of ease them into it so i

891
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
say well you are the owner of a critical

892
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
application

893
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
according to our policy your

894
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
applications should be tested pen tested

895
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,559
every once every two years

896
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,200
your last pen test was two years ago or

897
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
never

898
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
and then i go to them and i say well

899
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,760
according to our policy it should be

900
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,519
tested it's going to cost you about this

901
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
amount of money it's going to cost you

902
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,519
about this amount of time from your

903
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,919
part of the organization it will give

904
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,919
you this information we're going to

905
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,480
expect you to do that with it so i kind

906
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,799
of walk them through the whole process

907
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,799
and then and i do this a year in advance

908
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,440
because i make year plans for my team

909
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
so i'm going to ask them a year in

910
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
advance would you like us to test your

911
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
application next year you should be

912
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,760
saying yes because you're owner of

913
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
critical application blah blah in i've

914
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
never experienced them saying no but if

915
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,000
they would ever say no there's two

916
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
things i can do as a cso i can go to the

917
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,559
cio and say hey this owner of this

918
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,559
critical application is supposed to get

919
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,880
their applica application tested because

920
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
this is the policy they are refusing

921
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,960
this right now what you want to do and

922
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,039
then the cio can escalate it they can

923
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,960
talk to that owner or they can go to the

924
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,840
board

925
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,559
or they can just say it's fine with me

926
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,159
if the cio says it's fine with me

927
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,200
cio trumps me in my organization so i

928
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
would just make sure i get it in writing

929
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
and i have it i have it stored away

930
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
fine we go to a different application

931
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,440
but if that application gets attacked or

932
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,399
we get

933
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,640
hacked because of that application

934
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
that's not tested or that's that's

935
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
vulnerable i would say

936
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,039
you know that's on the cio and the owner

937
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,720
because they made that decision not to

938
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,840
test it

939
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,559
so that's how i usually handle that kind

940
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,399
of thing it depends on the organization

941
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,559
because there's organizations where

942
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,360
you know it's standard to test uh every

943
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,919
new application or it's standard to test

944
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,919
every application that's in development

945
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,120
it depends

946
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,039
but that's just how i

947
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,519
handle it

948
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,039
so

949
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,760
signal angel are there any questions

950
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
from online

951
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
can you read it please there was one

952
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,079
question but this already answered

953
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
okay excellent

954
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,918
there is more space for questions i'm

955
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,599
going to give you guys all still an

956
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
opportunity to come up uh in the

957
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,440
meanwhile there actually is one question

958
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,079
from me something that i was wondering

959
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
um so you mentioned that you would like

960
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
for the pen testing companies to deliver

961
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
a cost estimate of what it might cost

962
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,440
for the organization to fix uh the

963
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,879
vulnerabilities

964
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
given the fact that we're a third party

965
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,918
without intimate knowledge of your

966
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,639
organization and i t infrastructure

967
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,199
beyond what we saw during the pen test

968
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
uh how can we as third parties be able

969
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,359
to make this kind of an evaluation it's

970
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,119
actually not something i said you should

971
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,440
do it's just what the manager said i did

972
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
the poll with

973
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,719
said they would like

974
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,560
but you're completely right it's not

975
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,440
very realistic to ask this but what you

976
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,480
could do is have them kind of estimate

977
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,359
it like it doesn't have to be a um how

978
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,880
do you say alferta i don't know an

979
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,359
english word um it doesn't have to be

980
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,440
like a precise number but you could say

981
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,280
it's probably between

982
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,520
this and that amount of money if they

983
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,480
really want to have a cost estimate in

984
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,240
my experience i'm usually the one that

985
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,839
does that so when i write the advice

986
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,480
that's based on the pen test report i

987
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
make a cost estimate for my board and i

988
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
say it's probably going to cost you this

989
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
much if you choose option a or if you

990
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
choose option b because that's the thing

991
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,880
the pen test report usually doesn't

992
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,760
uh specifically say you should do this

993
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
to fix this finding it usually says you

994
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
should do something about your

995
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,040
authentication or your whatever and then

996
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,520
it's up to the organization to to make a

997
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,839
decision on if they want that vpn for

998
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,040
their portal or monitoring to tackle a

999
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,480
phishing attack

1000
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,839
okay thank you

1001
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,320
uh we've got another question here um

1002
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,440
go ahead

1003
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
hi fleur so there was a lot of wisdom in

1004
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,680
this presentation and thank you for that

1005
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,040
and i would hope to get a little bit

1006
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
more of your wisdom

1007
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,800
um and i know you cannot be extremely

1008
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
specific in your answer but when you are

1009
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
looking for parties to do a pen test for

1010
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
you are there some things that give you

1011
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,880
good vibes

1012
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,960
or things that give you bad vibes

1013
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,359
because one day i will need a pen tester

1014
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,040
and i would like to

1015
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
have some clues on how to find out the

1016
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
good ones

1017
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
so i like i like companies where i get

1018
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
to talk to pen testers so i don't get to

1019
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
talk to a salesperson but i call them i

1020
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,040
say well i'm going to need a pentas for

1021
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
this or this application

1022
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
can you can you do this do you actually

1023
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
do this

1024
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,480
sometimes they say we don't have time or

1025
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
whatever

1026
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
and then if they do have time i always

1027
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,240
ask can i talk to one of your band

1028
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,720
testers because i'd like to discuss with

1029
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,040
them the what we want them to test and

1030
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,560
the way we want to test it and i want to

1031
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
make sure that you can do it

1032
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,480
and sometimes that's not even a

1033
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,240
possibility you don't get to talk to pen

1034
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
testers you just get a sales person that

1035
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,640
wants you to jot down a date

1036
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,960
and when the date is decided upon then

1037
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,280
the whole pen tester you never see hear

1038
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
or talk to you just get a

1039
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,800
not for for you an anonymous report back

1040
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,640
by someone someone you never talked to

1041
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
before and there's all these findings

1042
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,760
and whatever i don't like that i want to

1043
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,280
talk to the pen testers i want to

1044
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
discuss things with them

1045
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
um

1046
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,839
that's that's the most important

1047
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,240
criteria i would say

1048
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,599
and also as a cso it's it's helpful if

1049
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,520
you kind of dive into that world you

1050
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
don't have to become a pen tester but it

1051
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,599
helps if you recognize that a report is

1052
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
sent in to you and it's just an

1053
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
automated scan

1054
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
um

1055
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,960
that's not what you're trying to

1056
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
to get like it's fine to use automated

1057
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
tools don't get me wrong

1058
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
but you want a pen tester to elaborate

1059
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,240
on the findings they get from the tools

1060
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
so yeah that's why i said that's what i

1061
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,000
would look for i look for are you able

1062
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,359
to talk to the people that are going to

1063
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,880
actually do the test

1064
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
and make sure that you as a cso can see

1065
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,359
if work is actually qualitatively good

1066
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,280
or it's just

1067
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,000
an automated scan

1068
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
yes

1069
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,920
i would like to ask about scope because

1070
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,320
you were talking about scope and

1071
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
sometimes i like to go a little bit

1072
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
outside of scope

1073
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
because where i was educated in pen

1074
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,200
testing we were providing network

1075
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,640
security and not host security and

1076
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,079
so my question is

1077
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,000
out of curiosity i'm based in denmark

1078
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,599
and we are pragmatic so i don't get into

1079
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,359
trouble but i would like to hear if

1080
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,839
that's the same case in netherlands and

1081
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,599
then i have a follow-up question to that

1082
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,440
if i find something which is a little

1083
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
bit of out of scope say the router in

1084
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
front of the environment is really

1085
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
really badly configured would you have

1086
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
it included in the report or would you

1087
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,359
rather have that in an email outside of

1088
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,079
the report so i didn't really hear the

1089
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,720
last question uh if i find something

1090
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
that is out of scope yeah like the

1091
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,720
router in front of the network which is

1092
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
badly configured yeah would you like

1093
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
that in an email outside of the report

1094
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,359
as an appendix yeah so if you find

1095
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,720
something that's actually out of scope

1096
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
which you still want it in the report um

1097
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,400
i'll give you the answer what we did

1098
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,720
with the lockers we put it in reports it

1099
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,400
was out of the scope we actually put a

1100
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,880
picture of it in the report

1101
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
and looking back might not have been his

1102
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,720
wisest decision but we did

1103
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
it's a finding

1104
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
so yeah it was out of scope and

1105
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
it might have gotten me into a little

1106
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
trouble but it's still a finding and i

1107
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,480
think it's relevant and i think it's

1108
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,599
important and we should still do

1109
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,160
something about it so as long as you are

1110
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
not too far out of scope

1111
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
where i cannot defend you anymore as you

1112
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
see so then you're good i will i will

1113
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
try and and you know work it into the

1114
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,040
report in a way that i still think it's

1115
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,280
defendable but i think it's also a

1116
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
little bit of common sense of the pen

1117
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,440
tester like it's fine like i said if you

1118
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,119
find something that's a little out of

1119
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,800
scope it's different when you actually

1120
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
actively go looking for things that are

1121
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,280
out of scope that's i would say the the

1122
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,000
limit so any and actually um

1123
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,359
i i uh tell pentesters if you find

1124
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,720
things

1125
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,240
along the way that are actually out of

1126
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,160
scope but you you kind of stumble upon

1127
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,560
it mention it put it in the report

1128
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,839
that's that's totally okay

1129
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,000
i was wondering how do you see the role

1130
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
of deciso in handling the stakeholder

1131
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,800
management on um like your site but as a

1132
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
project manager for pen testing i've

1133
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
often encountered

1134
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
parties that are very

1135
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,119
defensive you know they're afraid that

1136
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,400
they're going to be

1137
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,040
blamed for having their job badly done

1138
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,920
while in essence pen testing is to help

1139
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,599
the organization to improve and get

1140
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,079
better and there there is a bit of a

1141
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,000
shift in that but it's still they feel

1142
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,160
still feel like a slap on their hands

1143
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,400
yeah it's very important first of all

1144
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,599
that's

1145
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,520
the stakeholder management

1146
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,200
part is very important that's why i said

1147
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
in the presentation you need to make

1148
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
sure that you get your owners involved

1149
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
in the whole process

1150
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
so you go to them you establish the

1151
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,839
goals what do we want to get tested

1152
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,520
right now

1153
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,680
what is the goal of this test

1154
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,119
and

1155
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,880
you you make sure that they're involved

1156
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,560
in the in the end of the process where

1157
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,319
they get the presentation

1158
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,240
and they can ask the questions

1159
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,480
and that sort of thing so make sure that

1160
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,000
they're involved in the whole process

1161
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,680
it's not just a cold report on their

1162
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
desk

1163
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,960
after a few weeks that says you've done

1164
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,599
all this wrong but they are part of the

1165
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,599
testing process another thing i find

1166
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,520
very important is that you look at the

1167
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,240
ethics side of things so i if if you

1168
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,599
know me a little bit you know i'm very

1169
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
against fake fishing emails

1170
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,839
because i think they're ethically

1171
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
very wrong

1172
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,800
so i would never send out a fake

1173
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,520
phishing email to do a facing test in my

1174
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,200
organization and make sure everyone

1175
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,240
knows that

1176
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,160
so

1177
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,839
also another thing is that's why i said

1178
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,000
involve your i.t department make sure

1179
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,760
they know that this test is coming

1180
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
because you don't want them to feel

1181
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,280
sneaked up on

1182
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,880
um as well as if you do a certain tests

1183
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,760
that might make their work harder

1184
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,040
you need to make sure they notice in

1185
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,440
advance and also when we come with the

1186
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,200
findings the first thing there's also a

1187
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
presentation for your technical people

1188
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
so i talked i forgot to mention this you

1189
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
do a presentation for the board and the

1190
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,839
managers but you also let the pen

1191
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,760
testers do a presentation of their

1192
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,160
findings for your i.t department so they

1193
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
can ask questions and they know what was

1194
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,400
tested and found and i will always make

1195
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,560
sure that they know you didn't

1196
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
do everything wrong it's not you do

1197
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
don't do your job right it's just how

1198
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,119
can we do even better

1199
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,240
um

1200
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,598
so yeah very important

1201
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,760
i'm gonna have you you're the last

1202
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,960
question and then we're going to finish

1203
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,640
because you know

1204
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,839
people want to know the answer to the

1205
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,839
poll probably last one yay

1206
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,440
um uh i'm doing auditing and and lately

1207
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
i'm i've seen a lot of current oh well

1208
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,240
some pentest reports so that they are

1209
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,319
formulated so that they are kind of

1210
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,480
uh kind of risk

1211
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,839
a formula as a risk for it

1212
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,280
and usually for a risk for iso

1213
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
271 or something else that they are like

1214
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
this is a risk usage so

1215
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,800
they

1216
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,000
can kind of

1217
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,839
be lifted directly to the risk

1218
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,040
management

1219
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,800
side of of things

1220
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,200
what's your take on is that the good way

1221
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,359
of kind of

1222
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,599
lazy way of doing it

1223
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,800
so what you're saying is you're in

1224
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,960
auditing and when there's a pen that's

1225
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,839
done then yeah i'm just reading a lot of

1226
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,400
pen testing reports and i've seen those

1227
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,319
that they are like then this has been

1228
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,160
done and then it's oh they don't really

1229
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,800
care what's in it it's just uh you know

1230
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,240
we've done a pen test it doesn't matter

1231
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,079
what the quality is i mean dependency

1232
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,359
results are formulated as a risk that

1233
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,680
you have risk and then

1234
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,359
you should maybe do this and you can

1235
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,960
kind of use that in research there's

1236
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
something to be said for that

1237
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,240
because in my eyes security is very

1238
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,560
close to risk management

1239
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,640
and your risk appetite can be different

1240
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,119
than in other organizations

1241
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,880
as a criminologist

1242
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
what i like to say is uh it's you don't

1243
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,160
have to make your home an unpenetrable

1244
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,640
ford to make sure it doesn't get broken

1245
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,400
into it just has to be harder than the

1246
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
neighbor's house

1247
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,240
because most uh people that break into

1248
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,640
homes are opportunists and they just

1249
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,319
have a look and see the easiest house to

1250
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,680
get into that's the one they break into

1251
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,480
and hackers or criminals i must say are

1252
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,359
uh very akin to that so they'll likely

1253
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,480
break into your network if it's easier

1254
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,079
than other people's networks to break

1255
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
into or if they're apts they're just

1256
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
looking for something in specific

1257
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,480
but that's just a risk factor that you

1258
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,079
have to

1259
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,560
make be accountable for so yeah

1260
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,520
i agree that sometimes it's a good idea

1261
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,359
to have a pen test and

1262
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,319
treat it as a risk

1263
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,280
something

1264
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,800
you need to either accept or do

1265
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,640
something about because some you don't

1266
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,960
have to do you know not all findings in

1267
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,200
a pentas report need necessarily get

1268
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,400
followed up on sometimes they are just

1269
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,480
interesting or

1270
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,400
mild findings that would take

1271
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,240
disproportionately amount of time or

1272
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
money to get fixed and the risk what

1273
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,040
happens if they get

1274
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,520
abused are very low well that's just

1275
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
something a manager needs to you know

1276
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
think about

1277
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,680
thank you

1278
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,800
so

1279
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,880
let's have a look remember that we did

1280
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
the poll with the managers and we asked

1281
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,119
them what it were check some meant and

1282
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,200
like 50 of you thought it was the answer

1283
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,160
of b

1284
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
and another 50 c so you really have no

1285
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
faith in your managers which you were

1286
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,119
correcting because

1287
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,880
most managers actually thought that the

1288
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,960
checksum is a sum of multiple vulnerable

1289
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,200
systems that have been checked for the

1290
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,119
same known vulnerability over the course

1291
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,000
of multiple tests

1292
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,480
don't use the word checksum in your

1293
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,760
management summaries people

1294
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
but the main points i'm trying to make

1295
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,240
here are when you're a leader when

1296
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,400
you're a cso you need to lead the test

1297
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,160
you need to coordinate don't sit back

1298
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,079
and let the vendor decide what they want

1299
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,400
your application to be tested for that's

1300
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,920
your job

1301
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,599
you need to address responsibility

1302
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,040
because that's how you get it followed

1303
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,839
up on you need to write quality reports

1304
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,280
and be able to talk to a board if you're

1305
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,560
a pen tester

1306
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
well that might be a little bit of a

1307
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,720
bold statement but at least you know try

1308
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,000
and see if you can get there

1309
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,599
and don't use language managers don't

1310
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,440
understand your management summary you'd

1311
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,880
be surprised

1312
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
really kind of use language you would

1313
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,079
use with a toddler

1314
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,920
even though there aren't but i'm afraid

1315
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
that's uh that's what

1316
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,839
in our frame of mind you should do they

1317
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,000
are not toddlers but that's

1318
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
how we would uh think about it

1319
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,640
so if you'd like to follow me on twitter

1320
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,160
that's where you can find me i have

1321
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,640
actually a bonus slide that i saved

1322
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,240
because i asked them another question i

1323
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,200
still have like one minute or something

1324
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,880
and i also asked them it's in dutch

1325
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,160
while translate i also asked them what

1326
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,040
the word powershell means

1327
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,920
about 53 percent of the managers i asked

1328
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
think that powershell is a popular

1329
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,559
operating system that hackers use to

1330
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,440
uh

1331
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,359
like disclose vulnerabilities to each

1332
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,440
other

1333
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,240
and uh thanks to uh barrett who kindly

1334
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,359
offered me this this third option that

1335
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,920
many chose another 43 percent or 14

1336
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,240
think that powershell is actually a

1337
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,040
module in microsoft powerpoint that runs

1338
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,079
code in the background

1339
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,720
but 43 of managers actually knew what

1340
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,079
powershell meant

1341
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,400
it's a way to automate uh

1342
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,720
tasks in computers that'll use a lot of

1343
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
admins use so

1344
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,880
sorry

1345
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,960

1346
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
