2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
welcome this is referral engineering the

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,279
albert lineup for fun and profit

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,920
um let's first introduce myself i am

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,400
nick varus i work as a knock engineer

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
at speak up they do voice over ip

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
thingies like

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,439
like was presented

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
and by night i'm a hacker tinkerer and a

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,640
hosting provider i do some uh hosting

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,239
provider work for

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,879
for small businesses in uh in and around

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,160
and today

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,520
so

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
let's get started why did i choose the

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
albert ein to reverse engineer well

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
they're close by to me and

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
they give benefits to people that use a

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,360
bonus guide that bonus cards

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
is meant to be linked to you as a person

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,920
and that gives you all kinds of

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
discounts

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
and another reason was that

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
i mean other supermarkets also have an

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,040
extensive api so maybe you'll find some

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
inspiration from this

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
and

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
reverse engineer for example the jumbo

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,040
app or

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
the app in a in another country

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,640
so let's explore the api

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
we have an app and this is a

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
very simple screenshot of

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
how the app can look

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
this is uh of some some discounts and

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,000
some some products that were lost last

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,759
spot

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,799
and

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
what happens in the background when you

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,759
open this page

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,439
is that you

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,399
your app does a get request to well this

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,920
url

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
and how can we find find this out how

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,439
can we see what the app is doing in the

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
background

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,320
well it's very easy there are these

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,360
tools

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
and there are other tools as well but

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
these are charles and verb suite

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
and what you what you can do with these

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,880
is

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
man in the middle your own phone that

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,119
can be very interesting

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
what you need to do is install a

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
certificate authority on your on your

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,920
phone it needs to be trusted

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
and once you do that

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,560
and the app hasn't been secured against

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,520
this

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
because the most bank apps will be

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
and other apps as well

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
but the albutein app is not so when we

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
install our own ca certificates we can

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,079
listen to the traffic

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,560
if you have a mac with a m1 processor or

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
m2

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
you can make this easier because

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
well

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
iphone and ipad apps can run on your

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
laptop and

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,599
that makes it so you don't have to

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
install certificate authorities on your

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
phone

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
charles can do that for you

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
once once you open charles all traffic

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,000
flows through that and

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,519
that makes it a lot easier to refresh

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,879
engineer

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
so

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
uh here's an example of something you

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,239
might want to do

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,440
in the app

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
or data you want to get from the app

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
they have these these loyalty programs

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
where you can save up for

87
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
in this case towels

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,519
and every time you get a free full

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
cart with eight stamps uh you get

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,480
towels for three or four euros

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
so what if you want to track your

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
progress in this

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
say you visit the albert time very much

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
and you want to see how you progress

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,239
progress alone well you just do an api

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
request to

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
to this url here

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
and what you get back is

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
a json response it's very handy this is

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,720
how the app

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
works in the background your app is just

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
the front end for their api they've

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,879
built an api then build a front end and

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,640
that is how the app works

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,159
so

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
we have the balance right there very

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,959
handy

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
and

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,239
you can track that over time in pretty

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,840
grafana dashboards i'm a great fan of

111
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
that um i promised you for profit so

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
here's why it's for profit avatar is a

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,920
thing called the bonus box

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
what you need to do every week is go in

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
there and pick out what kind of

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
discounts you want

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
and well as you guessed

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
there's an api call for that too

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
you just do a request to that url there

120
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
give the start date you get back a json

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
response with other products that will

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,440
be discounted for you and you only

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
we can also activate those products

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
you send a few parameters

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,880
and then the offer is activated and

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,759
well

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,639
you have

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
you have discounts that you wouldn't

129
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
have if you weren't going to go into the

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,880
app every week and manually activate

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
those offers

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
so

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
there's a little bit of profit

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
i did exactly that

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
i wrote a script and it

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
goes down all the uh all the things that

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
i can uh

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
um activate

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
and that um

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
uh

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
that makes it that i have cheaper

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
groceries i mean alpha time is not

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
cheapest if you're from the netherlands

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
you'd know that

145
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,639
but they can be if you have to write the

146
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,199
right offers

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
here's the thing though about time made

148
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,720
it pretty annoying to work with this api

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
it used to be that you can just send a

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
login request

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
via posts

152
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
and then

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
you would be able to log in get a token

154
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,320
and do all these api requests

155
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
what they did a

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
short while ago is

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
enable captcha on that login process and

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
there is no other way

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,479
to get

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
an authentication token

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,440
so

162
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
what you need to do is uh sorry

163
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
what you need to do is man in the middle

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
either with a with a mac that can run

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
ios apps

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
or you need to

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
um well install a ca certificate on your

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
phone listen to the

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,240
uh

170
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
to the request it makes and then you

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
will see that it does a request for a

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
refresh token and that refresh token

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
gives you

174
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
you can submit a request with that

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
request token and it gives you a new

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
authentication token and a request token

177
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
so if you do that

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
let's say every half hour

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,800
you put that refresh token in a database

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,120
that gives you um

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
uh

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
that gives you quite a long time of uh

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
well playing with the api

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
so what if you want to play around with

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
this api for yourself

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
so some of you might have already seen

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
this but

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
i flashed it a couple of seconds ago

189
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
this is a

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
swagger page

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
everyone that works with apis will know

192
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,400
what this is

193
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
and this is basically some documentation

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,440
for

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
the albuteim api

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
and

197
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
because i want all of you to play around

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
with this i have released

199
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
this swagger page and as well as the

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
open api specification so you can scan

201
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
this qr code and uh

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
well uh go ahead for yourself it's on

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,759
github too so if you uh figure out more

204
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,080
api uh requests from the app

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
please submit a pull request i really

206
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
appreciate that and i know scanning qr

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
codes is scary

208
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
at the end i will

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
give you some ways to to contact me

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
like i said the overtime is not unique

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
in these

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
a lot of apps work this way this is an

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
example for the yumbo when i click on

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
the plus to

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
add this delicious hamburgers ala

216
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,758
minutes

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
it just sends a put request to this to

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
this url and the funny thing is i'm not

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
even authenticated here i just

220
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,680
downloaded the app and click the plus

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
button and uh i saw this

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
this in the in the app so that means

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
that jumbo is still tracking users that

224
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
haven't created an account yet it's

225
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
quite interesting

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
okay so that's

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
uh enough about the api i've given you

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
some examples of how i use it

229
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
and i've given you a way to

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
play with it play with it yourself

231
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
and i'd now like to talk about the brief

232
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
story of

233
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,599
random bonus cards puntanel

234
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,360
and some people started laughing

235
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,559
random bonus

236
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
is exactly what you but you think it

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,919
does

238
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
once you go there you'll be presented

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,039
with

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,919
a bonus card that means that

241
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
overtime can track your purchases

242
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
because all the time uses the bonus card

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
to well track you and

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
in return you get you get discounts but

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
most people don't want to be tracked so

246
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
here is random bonus card doesn't help

247
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
it's meant to be used on your phone

248
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
and

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
well it works really well

250
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
a lot of people use it

251
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
how do i know a lot of people use it i

252
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
can track website visitors

253
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
i have a modomo install on on this

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
website so i can track that

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
but i want to know how many people

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
actually go to the albert hein and scan

257
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,080
that that goes

258
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
are others as well i'm not the only one

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
who does this here are three examples

260
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
bonus card with new

261
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
uh well bonus green data punta nel and

262
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
bonus gotcha internal

263
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
and these do exactly the same

264
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
although i don't know if these actually

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,399
generate random bonus cards or if these

266
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,279
are

267
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
doing a similar thing to me

268
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
because well i thought one day what if i

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
put my own bonus card on there

270
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
and what if i only put my own bonus

271
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
cartoon on there so i put several on

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
them on there

273
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
and you might think well

274
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
that breaks the promise of

275
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,399
a random bonus card it's not random

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
anymore that's true

277
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,120
but

278
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
the reason you would like to use a

279
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
random bonus card is to

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
have anonymity while you're shopping

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
and once there are enough users on the

282
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
same bonus card the

283
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,680
profile gets so contaminated

284
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,880
that

285
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
oh that the data isn't of use anymore to

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
the albeit

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,959
so

288
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
i did that

289
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
and

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,279
here is a map of

291
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
all the albert heinz

292
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
that people did groceries with my bonus

293
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,120
character and this is only july sorry

294
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
june this is only june

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,959
because the the albutein app gives you

296
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,920
uh

297
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
a api call to track receipts and that

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,839
proceeds has data of the address to

299
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
store so once you get that address and

300
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
you put that through a

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
location api get the latitude and

302
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
longest use and then

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
you store it in a database and you get

304
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
this

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
i have more statistics as well

306
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
here is uh how many people use my

307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,600
website is 1305 and this is just in

308
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,959
in june

309
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
um

310
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
here you can track the the the amount of

311
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
times it was used

312
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,640
per day

313
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
so it was quite a busy day there on the

314
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,839
18th

315
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,880
um not sure what's up with that

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
of course uh albert hein isn't the

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
only app that has a private api and

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,519
jumbo isn't as well there are others

319
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
and um

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
has anyone here i heard of ghost

321
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,000
scooters

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
okay a couple of people

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
go scooters are a rental

324
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
service where you can download an app

325
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
and unlock a scooter that's on the

326
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
street

327
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
people don't often treat them lightly

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,639
they take don't be gentle it's a rental

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,920
a bit too far if you ask me

330
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
if you download the app you get this

331
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
this pretty map

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
and

333
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
you can see all the

334
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
vehicles that are around you

335
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
so let me zoom out here and i'll go to

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
almeira

337
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
and

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
you can see how far zoomed out i am and

339
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,519
how many dots you can see

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,279
so that means that

341
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
the data must be coming from somewhere

342
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
right

343
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
well yep and i actually like to do this

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
with a live demo

345
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,700
so

346
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,600
[Applause]

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
okay let's see if i can drag my terminal

348
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
over to the next screen yep there we go

349
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
and can i maximize this

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
then make the text a little bigger

351
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
all right

352
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
so

353
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,120
once you do a api request to

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,000
this url here

355
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,760
user.api does go urban.services

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
what do you what do you think will

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
happen

358
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,839
um well i'm going to spoil this for you

359
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,120
i'm just going to press enter and it

360
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,079
gets a huge json request back the json

361
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,959
response back with uh well a lot of data

362
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,440
actually and more data than uh

363
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
than i expected

364
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
some of these coordinates are pretty

365
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
precise and you can also see the license

366
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
plate and the state of charge of these

367
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,680
vehicles

368
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,839
not sure if this is meant to be this way

369
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,959
i'm guessing

370
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
there can be some

371
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,839
optimizations made here

372
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,399
i'd like to go back to

373
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,560
to this statistic here there's a reason

374
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
i showed june instead of july

375
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,839
and that is

376
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,000
my

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,839
my scraper runs every

378
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
uh 30 minutes and when it does that it

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,000
asks the obtain api hey can you give me

380
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,160
all four receipts on my account there's

381
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
no way to limit

382
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,760
that request

383
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
so what started happening was

384
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,959
that script started spewing out

385
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,720
error messages and those error messages

386
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
were 504 timeouts gateway timeout

387
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
so

388
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
what happened was that the request got

389
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
so big that the underlying servers

390
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,279
weren't able to handle my request in

391
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,360
time

392
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
because my scraper runs every 10 minutes

393
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
or every 30 minutes i put it down a

394
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
little bit

395
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
there's less strain on their databases

396
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,160
um but i think some engineer at alba

397
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
appetite noticed

398
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
because they limited my

399
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
the results i got back

400
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
i got curious how big is that response

401
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,240
it's about 20 000 lines of json so

402
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
i can i can

403
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
understand why

404
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
why someone did something

405
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,399
about that

406
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,000
the only problem is

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
they didn't limit it on the last

408
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
receipts so

409
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
when i go into the app now and i check

410
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,279
my latest receipts the latest one is

411
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,240
from

412
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,480
october last year

413
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,759
so

414
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,839
no more pretty stats for me

415
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,920
the this card looks quite empty for

416
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
today and

417
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,920
rest of the month july as well

418
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,560
what can you do

419
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,639
we talked about the

420
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
the goal sharing and we've

421
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
checked out the

422
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,759
the go urban api so

423
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,320
what's the what's the more of the story

424
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,040
just open up your apis i mean you've

425
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
already built it

426
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,120
and there can be

427
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
once you do that you give other people

428
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,920
the possibility to create amazing things

429
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
one example i heard was someone that

430
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
created a scanner app

431
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
where you can scan a barcode and it will

432
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
automatically add that to your shopping

433
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
list

434
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
it's beneficial to all the time because

435
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
it creates convenience and once it's on

436
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
your all-time shopping list well then

437
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
you're most likely to go to the alpha

438
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,240
time to buy that product

439
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
and

440
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
you've already built it again so why why

441
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
not why not release it i mean you can't

442
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,959
release it the way it's

443
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,480
it is right now you have to do some

444
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,079
tweaks i mean mostly with the

445
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,480
authentication and the paths can be

446
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
cleaned up as well but uh hey i don't

447
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
care if all the time releases this the

448
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
way it is

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
um and i really hope they do another

450
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
point by the way is data freedom

451
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
you can check

452
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,720
track your own

453
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
groceries

454
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
if you decide not to use random bonus

455
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
card.now which i highly highly recommend

456
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,760
so

457
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,079
what can you do does anyone know what

458
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
these are

459
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
awesome i'm going to explain them anyway

460
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
these are amazon dash buttons

461
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
the idea is that you order amazon dash

462
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,919
buttons and once you

463
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
push the button

464
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,080
one of these items will be added to your

465
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
to your shopping cart on on amazon.com

466
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
or

467
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
wherever you're from and it will also

468
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
place the order for you if you want

469
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
you could make your own one of these

470
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,160
you can track the alt time

471
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
delivery

472
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,280
time slots

473
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,919
and you can also just place an order

474
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
for delivery uh through the albatine app

475
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,559
which is uh

476
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,480
what i did of course to try it out

477
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
[Laughter]

478
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,039
because you uh

479
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,440
once the career comes you pay at the

480
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
door so that makes it possible to to

481
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
place another like that

482
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
so i'd like to thank you all for

483
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
attending my talk and if you want to

484
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
contact me that's that's how you can do

485
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,039
that

486
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,840
thank you

487
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,510
[Music]

488

and and thanks dear dear audience for

490
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
applauding a live demo i think that is

491
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
very cool thing to do

492
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
i didn't even bring an offer to the

493
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,640
demogod so

494
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
are there any

495
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,600
questions

496
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
and if you have a question please move

497
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
over to the microphone and ask a

498
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
question there so the people in the live

499
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
stream also

500
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
can hear your question thank you so much

501
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
uh

502
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,200
the person in the back was first so you

503
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
can go first

504
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,919
i apologize if i missed this but

505
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,320
are you actually able to generate a a

506
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,360
random

507
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,559
uh

508
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,160
barcode for for the uh bonus cards is

509
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
there an algorithm to that or is there

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,559
just like any random

511
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
unique id would be valid

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
uh yeah the the bonus card is just a

513
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
rod 13 or sorry a and 13 barcodes and

514
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
there's a certain range of card numbers

515
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,480
and what you can do is generate your own

516
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
and ask the albert ein api if that is a

517
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
valid bonus card or not and that is

518
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
actually how random bonus card.nl worked

519
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
in the beginning

520
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
it just once you loaded the page it

521
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
generated one and if it was valid it

522
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
will show that to you

523
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
i changed it up a bit for well

524
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,760
statistics reasons but

525
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
yeah there is a way to actually generate

526
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
random bonus cards

527
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,799
random bonus cards

528
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,400
thank you for your question next one up

529
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
go ahead superman

530
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,679
thanks thanks for the uh interesting

531
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,760
talk i saw he had 272

532
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
of the honduk say whole things how did

533
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
you get those and uh was that the random

534
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
bonus card

535
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
account yep yep that's exactly it

536
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
well done well done

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
if you need some by the way just come

538
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
talk to me and i'll transfer some to you

539
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
it's no problem

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
thank you so much go ahead

541
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so apart from uh transaction costs and

542
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
uh interesting location data

543
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
do you have any other interesting data

544
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
that you get via the

545
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,150
not so random bonus character

546
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,080
[Laughter]

547
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,919
i'm mainly thinking of

548
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,080
interesting personal data right no

549
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
it's very hard to uh

550
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
didn't actually try but it's

551
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,120
very hard to track individual users

552
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
that use the website i can't see

553
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,480
that the same person that used the bonus

554
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
card in

555
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,960
almeira also used it in amsterdam a week

556
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,840
later i can't see that i i don't i and i

557
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,600
don't even want to know that either

558
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
that's good to know

559
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,039
the promise is anonymity and i want to

560
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
keep it that way

561
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
i was wondering do you have any tips

562
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
because you were currently discussing

563
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
how can you oh you were currently

564
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
discussing how to reverse engineer rest

565
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
apis i was wondering do you have also

566
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,640
have any tips to reverse engineer gql

567
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,840
apis or web sockets or other types of

568
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
infrastructures uh the same method i use

569
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,159
for for this rest api also works for

570
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,919
revql

571
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
apps or web sockets you can once you man

572
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
in the middle you can see all the

573
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
traffic that the uh

574
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
that the app uh uh that the app

575
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
generates

576
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
and you can also see the responses from

577
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
the uh from the server

578
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
yeah but i'm more i meant more like do

579
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,039
you know any specific tooling or any uh

580
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,640
yeah the same tooling i showed you so

581
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
sweet and charles can also

582
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
see that kind of traffic

583
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
and

584
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,360
the way i i documented this api was with

585
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
a postman collection so you can

586
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
what i did is copy the request as curl

587
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
from charles in this case and then paste

588
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
that into postman because postman can

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
understand cool commands yeah of course

590
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
postman isn't able to understand web

591
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,559
sockets right sorry a postman doesn't

592
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
understand web sockets yeah that that's

593
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,400
yeah you need another tool for that all

594
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
right i don't have experience with

595
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,240
websockets sorry

596
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
go ahead yeah i was wondering if you

597
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,840
racked up that many honduc secrets how

598
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,240
many air mouse did you rack up and what

599
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,120
did you buy with that

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
no comment

601
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
i love that one please go ahead oh yeah

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
um another question in the for-profit uh

603
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,480
part

604
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
um this likely also means that you can

605
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
get all the product details and pricing

606
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
and do nice comparisons with that

607
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
exactly yeah that's that's one way you

608
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,679
could use this this api just grab the

609
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
same product and the price and see how

610
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
that develops over time yeah yeah

611
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,679
do you have anything available for that

612
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,880
or is that something that uh um

613
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
the

614
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
the swagger i released and the the open

615
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,760
api specifications have some calls for

616
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
listing products in certain categories

617
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
or searching for products so that should

618
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
help you with

619
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
with that

620
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,280
with that endeavor

621
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
you could also do the same thing as i

622
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
did and

623
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
listen to the traffic that it generates

624
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
and see what it does when you

625
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
tap a certain product you most likely

626
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,559
get a product id and can query that for

627
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,240
for the price details

628
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,720
okay thank you

629
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,000
um this is maybe more of an albert hein

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,159
question than a reverse engineering

631
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,120
question

632
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,240
but

633
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
would it be possible for someone to take

634
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
one of the random bonus cards and sign

635
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,400
up in the albert hine app as though it

636
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
was their bonus cart enroll in the cope

637
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
zajul's program and then harvest the

638
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,720
cope vehicles from inattentive people at

639
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
checkout that weren't noticing that they

640
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,080
were purchasing some extra coupons

641
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,880
uh to clarify by the way i didn't enable

642
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
the cop shackles on random bonus cards i

643
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
don't know i want to keep you as a user

644
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,919
um

645
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,520
but no it's not possible to claim this

646
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
account to a different this bonus cut to

647
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,799
a different account

648
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,520
because it's already linked to mine

649
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
so once you try that it will say this

650
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,919
bonus card has already been linked to an

651
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
account and you cannot cannot link it to

652
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
another one

653
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
yeah you had the uh uh person like a

654
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
bonus which changes every week yeah but

655
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,679
i noticed in the api call that there's a

656
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
start date and an end date can you also

657
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,520
like query the bonus that you get next

658
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,679
week or next month

659
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,880
you can

660
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
create a bonus you get next week

661
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,799
from

662
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,919
first day of the previous week

663
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,120
so

664
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,960
once it is thursday you can do that

665
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
request with the with the start date and

666
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,960
the start date should be a monday

667
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,320
um and that gives you back the results

668
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
if you do that before then you will get

669
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,320
back an error message

670
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,279
so unfortunately

671
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
no

672
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,960
go ahead

673
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,000
yeah so i myself use just an unactivated

674
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,799
bonus card i grabbed from near the till

675
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,279
um which also works uh random bonus card

676
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,360
is a lot better so thanks for that

677
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
is there any chance that it generates a

678
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
random one which you then register as

679
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
you just said which then collides and

680
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,620
maybe steals away my bonus card

681
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,039
[Laughter]

682
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,279
like i said uh before that

683
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,840
the way it it used to work

684
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
was that it generated a random number

685
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
and checked that against the api

686
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
and

687
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,039
then then showed you that code or not

688
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
if that code was already linked to a

689
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,799
different albedine account i'd actually

690
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,360
not show it but generate a new one

691
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
because well someone can enable cop

692
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,360
shells and that that would

693
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,400
incur costs on on the users and i don't

694
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
want that okay so but it is possible

695
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
that my unactivated bonus card was

696
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
randomly generated by the app and you've

697
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
registered that isn't theory possible

698
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,919
yes okay how large is the key space

699
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
roundabout

700
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
um

701
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
i don't know off the top of my eyes i

702
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,559
can look that up for you

703
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,810
thanks

704
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,050
[Applause]

705
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,039
[Music]

706
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
thank you very much

707
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,279
i have uh one question from the internet

708
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,240
from uh touring he was uh wondering on

709
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
the random bonus card if you

710
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
automatically enabled all bonuses

711
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
on it

712
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
yep that's what that's the surface from

713
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,720
me to you uh

714
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,279
if you if you use that uh that website

715
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,279
uh i showed you a screenshot of the

716
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,240
scripts

717
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,520
uh

718
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
oh it's not on the screen yeah it can

719
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,440
yeah thank you oh sorry now it is

720
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
where is my screenshots

721
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
here it is

722
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,159
it does this every week for all the

723
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,000
bonus characters that are on random

724
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,559
bonus card.net

725
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
and what it does is i enabled all the

726
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
time premium for

727
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,000
reasons i'm not going to comment on

728
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,799
you can figure that one out

729
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,080
but it also gives me 10 uh

730
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
10 offers to choose from instead of 5.

731
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,039
what you could do is

732
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
bring in some more logic for example if

733
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,159
you're a fan of

734
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,480
a certain type of food you could

735
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
do some pattern matching and see when

736
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
that is

737
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,240
um in your bonus box and then

738
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
use that to

739
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,159
activate that offer every every week

740
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,679
what this does is just activates the

741
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,880
first 10.

742
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,640
so pretty simple but uh yeah it works

743
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,000
okay thank you

744
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,039
