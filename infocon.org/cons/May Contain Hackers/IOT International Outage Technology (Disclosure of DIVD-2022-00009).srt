[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,680
so i'm here on behalf of the divd we're

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,400
a dutch collector of of volunteer

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
helpful hackers

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
and we aim to make the digital world

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
safer by reporting vulnerabilities we

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,000
find in digital systems to people who

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
fix them who can fix them we have a

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
global reach but we do it dutch style

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
open honest and collaborative

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
and that sometimes makes people unhappy

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,239
so

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
i'm a bit stressed out

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
because this just happened

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
this is a statement from the vendor

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,160
saying that

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
that account that's named super admin

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
is in fact not

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
a real system administrator and is not

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
subject to our testing group

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
with sort of abilities to carry out

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,640
function tests

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
we are just informed once in early july

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
and then took the actions immediately

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
they asked and then they asked us not to

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
give this talk

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
so

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,640
this can either be short

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
or not

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,429
[Applause]

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
open honest collaborative we're not

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
going to propose this disclosure we've

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,360
given the vendor till

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
20 minutes ago to come up with a

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
reaction

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
i've not yet received such reaction

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,759
i will check my phone at the end of the

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,680
talk

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
so my name is frank bredeck i'm case

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,320
handler for divd case 2022009

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
i'm a crisis manager at the afd and my

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
day job is the cso at super phyllis this

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,360
is how you reach me

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,479
and it all

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,639
started with an honest

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,680
tweet from celestine one of our divd

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
researchers who noticed that her parents

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
had solar panels

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
that were had omnic converters in them

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
and omnic went bankrupt and now the

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
inverter is sending its data to solarman

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
in china

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,359
funny haha in a kind of gdpr way

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
this talk although it is an issue that

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,599
data of european citizens just gets sent

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,000
off to china this talk is not about gdpr

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
i was expecting a sigh of relief

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
but the tweet was followed up by a tweet

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
from yeller

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
smart

61
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,760
showing how he logged into

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
solarman with the superman user

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
super admin user

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
so who's yeller yellow hashem he's not

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,280
here he's taking a vacation

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
well-deserved vacation but he's the main

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
researcher on this and some people may

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,599
know him as schizo-ducky

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,200
some people know him a little bit more

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
than others

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
um

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
what does yellow do well he's a

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,480
programmer architect does devops is good

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,200
at finding passwords in things like

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
public github repositories he's done

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
hundreds of responsible disclosures in

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,599
the last three years

78
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
if he knocks on your door he's in

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
trouble because he didn't have to knock

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
he could have just walked in he had the

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
key and he's too is surprised about all

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
the brands he's been able to get into

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
so far

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
and he needs to add one

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
so this happened in february and um

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
yeah now what

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,680
and back in february uh sorry back in

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
april 2021

89
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,080
the ivd wasn't what it was now we were

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
still developing what we did what kind

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,519
of cases we took

92
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
and it does not qualify as the ivt case

93
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,080
then

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
it does now by the way

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
so we reported it to solarman we did

96
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,519
help yeller reach them

97
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
and although we didn't never got a reply

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
back

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
the password was changed a few days

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
later

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,479
case closed

102
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
life goes on and we fast forward to

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
february this year and yellow reads the

104
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
blog post by john from camper i don't

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
know if you're here young but if you are

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
a good post

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,520
um

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
about problems with connected

109
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,120
inverters

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
and that made us wonder

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
or it made yellow wonder

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
is solar man still okay

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,120
not really he could log into the super

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
admin account again so what have we got

115
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
what did we find in the github

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
repository

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
uh yeah that's solar man but not this

118
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,039
one

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
so solar man claims by themselves that

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,919
they are professional remote monitoring

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,479
and management is my addition

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
solution for

123
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,320
devices

124
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,039
devices from solar man solas omnic and

125
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,320
ginglong

126
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,720
mostly inverters loggers and batteries

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
and um yes these were the super admin

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
credentials for the monitoring platform

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
so what could we do

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,520
apparently with this account

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
read the data of all the users and we've

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,360
confirmed that we could see names we

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
could see addresses we could see email

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
addresses we should see current and

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
historical generation

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,039
we could create and delete users

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
change configurations calibration

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,560
offsets

139
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,919
read and clear errors in the converters

140
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,400
download firmware versions

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
upload new firmware we have an upload

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
screen

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
yeah basically this is the list of build

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
your own inverter botnet

145
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
um

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
we haven't tested this because of ethics

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
and our code of conduct

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
proportionality if you want to do

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,759
um responsible disclosure you have to to

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,720
be

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,199
your measures your tests do not have to

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
be worse than what you're trying to

153
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,080
prevent

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
also it has to be subsidiary that means

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
if you can use the smallest a small

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
hammer and a big hammer you should use

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
the smallest hammer possible

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,199
this would have been too big a hammer

159
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,880
at the wrong time

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
but we did confirm the data in there we

161
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
did confirm that gui showed us these

162
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
possibilities

163
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,000
so what numbers are we talking about

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
well these are the numbers from february

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
and remember it's winter in february

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
globally there were over close to a

167
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
million plants locations with solar

168
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,520
panels

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
of which 42 000 in the netherlands 7 000

170
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
in

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,319
germany 7 000 in belgium and about 13

172
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,400
000 in the uk

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,479
together producing in february

174
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,199
10.03 gigawatts

175
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,039
that's serious numbers so what's the

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
impact for the netherlands well if you

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
take 40 000

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,759
plants

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,120
with an average of between 4 and 10

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,319
kilowatt peak per plant

181
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
you add some bigger plants like the ones

182
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,359
we've listed here

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
you can buy

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
come up with a combined power of 400

185
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,039
megawatts

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
that's a little bit bigger as this thing

187
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
here and that's the 1025 electricity

188
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
plant on the whole health of the rainy

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
thousand

190
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
yeah so what could you do if you had

191
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
admin

192
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
install custom firmware create a botnet

193
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
use lateral movement so move from the

194
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,160
converter further down into the network

195
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
physically damage or overload the

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,599
converter

197
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
that could lead to bricking it or

198
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
overloading the device

199
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
we could block the vendor out change

200
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
their password see how they yeah what

201
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,199
would do that

202
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,800
could you hurt the grid

203
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
i don't know i'm not a grid expert

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
i know some

205
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,039
people who

206
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
know something or know people who know

207
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,559
something

208
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,080
one plant shouldn't be a problem

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
and it's not a novel idea to hurt the

210
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,880
grid

211
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
this was sent around during the farmer

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
protests earlier earlier this month on

213
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
the 4th of july

214
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
to all farmers and owners of panels and

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
windmills

216
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
let's all turn off our solar inverters

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
on the 4th of july wind power 2 we want

218
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
to make a statement that 20 of all green

219
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
power comes from farms if we do it all

220
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
at the same time we can cause outages

221
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,839
turn off at 4th of july

222
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
mid of day bam

223
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
this is a forward and message to forward

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
well

225
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
if a bunch of farmers can come up with

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
this idea i mean i know farmers are

227
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,440
smart but

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
nation states

229
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,519
i think they're smarter

230
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
and taking panels offline is one thing

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,000
but what if we go and use and use it to

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
do aerobics exercise

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
take it up and down and up and down that

234
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
would cause a serious problem on a grip

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,720
or

236
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
take all the panels in the north of the

237
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
netherlands offline and then once power

238
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
is ramped up there turn them back on and

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
turn all the power in south of the

240
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,519
netherlands that would be fun we have

241
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
gps coordinates

242
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
so

243
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,560
getting this fixed

244
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
was a long and windy route

245
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
this credential was actually committed

246
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
to github on the 5th of august

247
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
2019.

248
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,920
we discovered them in april of 2021

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
it was changed

250
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,440
in february we noticed it was working

251
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
again

252
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
and we opened the case and by the way we

253
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,720
welcomed yella as a researchers in our

254
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,760
midst

255
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
in the ivd

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
we contacted the dutch national cyber

257
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,320
security center we notified the vendors

258
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
on the 9th of february

259
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,079
we worked with the ncsc also on the 20th

260
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
of february they worked together they

261
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,959
contacted nccnl and this china cert

262
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
we mailed china cert

263
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
we

264
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
got a little help from the dutch embassy

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,720
we got a we visited the

266
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
chinese embassy ourselves

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
um finally there was contact with china

268
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
cert

269
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
and then

270
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
things went really quickly china cert

271
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,399
really did their job it's like 17

272
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,760
the contact

273
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
vendor changed the password repository

274
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
github repository was deleted

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,680
but this thing was exposed for

276
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,560
777 days

277
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
at least because we don't know when it

278
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
was turned back

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
what happened in between

280
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
i don't know

281
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,519
so it's fixed

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,279
github repository gone

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
password changed

284
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
well yes we resolved the situation where

285
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
everybody could potentially mess with

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
these devices but

287
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
there has to be a super admin password

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,240
somewhere

289
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
a party has to control this

290
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,560
is that a desired situation well the

291
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
dutch ministry of economic affairs and

292
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
climate has blocked the chinese company

293
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
from bidding on the construction of what

294
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
they call the stop contact

295
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
a wall socket at sea

296
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,440
and they did this because

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
they think

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
having a chinese company controlling

299
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,639
this much power on the grid is a

300
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
security risk

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,720
so

302
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
what about those solar panels

303
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,200
you may wonder why doesn't anybody do

304
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,639
something about this

305
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
well grid operators and energy companies

306
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,240
have no authority over what happens

307
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
behind the smart meter

308
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
if you overload your local grid your

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
fuse burns you're off the grid

310
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
problem solved

311
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
they can't put any regulation or any

312
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
enforcement in place

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
building codes are about electrical

314
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
safety

315
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,240
and we have an authority for

316
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
iot

317
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,800
and iot devices but yeah they can only

318
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,279
interfere when devices are

319
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
insecure

320
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
there's new regulation underway that

321
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
requires registering and certifying

322
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,240
devices if you want to sell them to

323
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,839
consumers

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
which you probably can circumvent by

325
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
going to aliexpress directly but

326
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
different manner

327
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
but even if these devices themselves

328
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,839
ever become 100 secure

329
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
you're still have a foreign party that

330
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
controls a major amount of power

331
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,240
in the grid

332
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
so that brought me

333
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,160
back to the opening talk that miko

334
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
hipponen gave

335
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,959
where he said

336
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
we're doing security we're no longer

337
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
securing computers

338
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,040
we are securing society

339
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,199
so statement from the vendor

340
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,439
let me check

341
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,760
i have a statement

342
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:57,569
[Applause]

343
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
dear frank this is way and i'm

344
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,720
responsible for marketing department

345
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
thanks for your reply and thanks for

346
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
any way for dutch ethical hacker finding

347
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
is an issue a issue for us

348
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
at present we're absolutely off the

349
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
court with the upcoming disclosure and

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
communication time left us is extremely

351
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
limited

352
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
it's an opinion

353
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,079
for now i can only say

354
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,160
firstly the account is subject to

355
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,120
testing group and not a super admin

356
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
account

357
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,839
which later we can prove provide proof

358
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
in details

359
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,160
secondly uploading firmware via the

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,719
account is fine

361
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,480
but no actual control function is

362
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
workable as real operation needs averted

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,279
verification and subject to

364
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
authorization from inverter

365
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,000
manufacturers

366
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,639
okay

367
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,040
thirdly the account is not related to

368
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
any account of other customers and won't

369
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
affect their pv plans

370
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
at last the account is now in safe

371
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
condition i hope that means they

372
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,279
implemented two-factor authentication

373
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,279
therefore believe we believe that there

374
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,079
is no effect to tv planned operation in

375
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,360
the system

376
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,720
in case you want to go public with the

377
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
case please do keep above facts in your

378
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
statement

379
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:29,920
as

380
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
we've done

381
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,240
and we expect not to mention the product

382
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,079
name in disclosure too late

383
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,519
and won't expect any exaggeration before

384
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,000
clarification i hope i didn't personally

385
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
i think we can create long-term

386
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
cooperation with your organization to

387
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,839
offer services to our customer in much

388
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
more secure way i hope so too

389
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,399
so we're really grateful that they are

390
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,600
reaching out that we are in contact now

391

uh we want to thank the china cert for

392
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279

394
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
from china

395
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
that's really important that we have

396
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,719
good international cooperation on this

397
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
and with that

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760

399
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:31,839
[Applause]

400
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,560
thank you frog we have about 10 minutes

401
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
for q a so you don't have to walk all

402
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
the way to the uh

403
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,920
which is over here so if you have any

404
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,079
questions beyond this talk you can

405
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
always find these guys over here

406
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
they have lots and lots and lots of war

407
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,399
stories going on so

408
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
half of them are not disclosable at all

409
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,560
so it's a bit of shame um any questions

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
nobody

411
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
well

412
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,279
i have

413
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,920
we have one question

414
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,240
have you looked at the hardware

415
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,119
architecture of the inverter and do you

416
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,559
think it would be possible to

417
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,359
for the output ac voltage to to shift

418
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,199
the phase alignment

419
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,240
relative to the grid so

420
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,919
so according to the statement of the

421
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,319
vendor

422
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
the firmware somehow can't magically

423
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,559
control this

424
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
um have we taken

425
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
people kind of get pissed if you take

426
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
their inverters because they have them

427
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
for a reason

428
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
um

429
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
anybody who has a solar man inverter

430
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
well we we've they changed the account

431
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
so we don't have the control now

432
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
um so no we didn't this wasn't the

433
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
hardware investigation for us this was

434
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,320
just a software investigation and a sas

435
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,520
platform

436
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
where we found the password from so we

437
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
haven't

438
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
um we're really curious though so if

439
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,679
somebody's willing to uh sacrifice their

440
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
uh their solemn controller and i guess

441
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
the likelihood just increased a little

442
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,480
bit

443
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
um please come by the village

444
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
thank you very much yeah are you a big

445
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600

446
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,039
