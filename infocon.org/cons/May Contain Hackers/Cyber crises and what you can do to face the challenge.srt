00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:16,480
[Music]

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,840
i am

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
really happy to introduce

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
the next speaker now is the other way

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
around like a couple of days ago i

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
introduced him to this angel job being a

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
herald and now i have the pleasure to

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,599
introduce my favorite angel vision uh to

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,440
you and in the context of his talk i

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
would like like this will be about

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
instant response about how to prepare

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
how to work out what to do upfront and

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
after it it's already too late

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,559
i believe um so

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,640
i would like to find out who is in

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
danger of having a heart attack so like

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
watching the talk therefore raise your

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,840
hand if you haven't

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
tried to replay your backups in the last

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
12 months

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,870
i haven't

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,199
[Laughter]

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,719
so i'm especially nervous about this

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,680
talk please give a big round of applause

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
for oscar or vision who is the chief

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
emerging security officer of the dutch

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
health ministry and right here to speak

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
to us not only as an angel but also as a

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
professional

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,799
thank you thank you

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,840
so

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
let's start off with talking about

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
crisis but in a light-hearted way

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
so with a lot of colors and having fun

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
because crises are more complicated than

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,360
you think

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,479
and this talk is meant for well i think

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,960
the people here not so much if you if

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
you work in a sock or if you work with

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
the things that i'm going to tell you it

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
should be just a

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
repeat

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
of things or if you work in technical

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,880
areas

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,399
of the company i think this would be

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
very interesting to see okay what can

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
you do to assist or help a cyber crisis

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
and what's going on in the company if

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
you have one now obviously we don't want

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
to have one because typically we all

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
work in a very happy situation

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
everything is nice and dandy we're yeah

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
we're creating stuff and we're making

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
this yeah we're running a business and

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
we're having a cool time

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,599
but sometimes you realize that sometimes

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
you see it in the on tv that well

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
you could actually end up into a

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
situation that is slightly more

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
stressful so how do you deal with that

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
and how do what kind of things are going

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
into

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
yeah basically dealing with the stress

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
that you get

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
so one of the things that i want to

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,840
emphasize is that i'm going to talk

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,959
obviously about so about a timeline

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,480
so i'm going to tell

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,440
what's happening in time with respect to

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
what an attacker is doing what you could

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,599
be doing what you think you should be

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
doing or well could have or could know

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,120
about

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
and yeah it it helps to know that that

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
you that you have situ certain situation

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
well it will become more clear in the

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
next few slides

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
let's lose time so some infinite amount

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
of days before the hack we still work in

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
a very happy environment nothing is

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,200
happening everything is cool

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
looking at the bright sunshine and we

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
watch into oblivion

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
but several days later things happen

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
what would happen

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
oh my god somebody is actually looking

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
at your internet ports you're looking

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,480
what kind of services you have online

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
could be a cloud stuff could be internal

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
this is not really the mo the important

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,080
thing

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
oh i thought it was this show that was

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
beeping anyway um so somebody could

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,440
could do an internet scan now what does

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,879
that bring you

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
hackers or attackers crime fighters i

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
don't know all kinds of people could

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
just scan your uh infrastructure and see

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,120
if there are vulnerabilities

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
now they would look for the

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
vulnerabilities and they could break in

102
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,319
obviously we know that some of the

103
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
situations are not that complicated

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
because well

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
some of the attacks actually end up into

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,120
the starting point of just sending an

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
email even more easier

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
i mean why would we hack a system if you

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
can just send a message people click on

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,199
it and then poof things happen for

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
example if you look at the

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,639
malware

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
infestation it starts with the malicious

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,960
email as a as a dropper so you get an

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
email hey please click here do something

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
and then the attack starts already in

117
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,199
deployment on the infrastructure so your

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,600
laptop gets compromised your your

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
account gets compromised

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
an attacker could then consider using at

121
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
least a build it in the malware that it

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
moves to another system into your

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
network and so on so basically they're

124
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
digging around in your network and you

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
have no idea what's happening in

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
particularly for ryuk

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
it starts locking your files and then

128
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
suddenly you have a problem running a

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
business

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,919
because if your files are locked you

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,280
cannot read them

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,600
they could read them extort you

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
and all the

134
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,440
happens you just got hacked this is what

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
we call day zero this is the time

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
component

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
and this is what we try to

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
try to think about okay what is the

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
actual day zero i would always say the

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
day zero is the day that you get hacked

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,000
but

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
did you actually know you get hacked

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
do you

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
let's split the timeline

145
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
you have companies that on one hand

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,600
have no

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,479
idea

148
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,600
that they actually got hacked already

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
because in ryuk it might be very obvious

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
that the files get compromised or at

151
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
least encrypted in this case and you do

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
not have the key in this case

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,520
and

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
yeah in some of the other malware cases

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
it's really pretty silent and you can go

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,759
on with your business for quite a while

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
they're just nesting in and then

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,880
going in for a kill later in time

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
but if you have a very

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
active sock

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,360
then perhaps you can spot

162
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
the attack

163
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
in time or at least in near real time

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
that's what you hope that's the ideal

165
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,479
situation

166
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
unfortunately

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the ideal situation is always a very

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
good hope and we work very hard in

169
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,880
actually getting there but we know from

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
a practice that not in all cases all the

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
new ways of getting into your

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
infrastructure gets analyzed properly

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
you always you are always a step behind

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,319
with respect to the newest developments

175
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,360
of course

176
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
so unfortunately most companies are in

177
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
the top timeline

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
you don't know that you are hacked until

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
it actually gets exploited or visible

180
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
somehow

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
so the attacker is trying to

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
keep it as silent as possible that they

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
are on the network they could try to dig

184
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,400
in

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
and perhaps if you look at the news i

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
think it's always very interesting to

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
see that the time states okay

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,720
the attack

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
entered in

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
and it turned out that the hack already

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
happened

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
months before the first sign of actually

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
that malware infestation

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
emerges on your machines

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
so i think that's always interesting how

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
much time does it actually take for you

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
to see that you are hacked

198
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
it's an interesting tactic

199
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
um i've seen quite some of some some of

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
the malwares that actually just well

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
wait as much as possible because then

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
they can go around into your network and

203
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
see what your business is all about what

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
type of machines do you have and then

205
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
go for the actual kill

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
so that would be day one

207
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,960
or at least to end because you don't

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,639
know how long it actually would be that

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,440
they would do stuff

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,199
so

211
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
when it actually emerges and that your

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
organization actually sees machines go

213
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,800
offline or services offline i would

214
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,280
always count that as they end the amount

215
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
of days that you got hacked

216
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
plus that the organization actually now

217
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
finally realized that you are hacked

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
quite some time i mean the amount of

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
days that you i mean how do you tell

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
your customers that you didn't know that

221
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
you were hacked for so much time

222
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,319
companies have a big problem there

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
because yeah uh media and people who are

224
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
not so tech savvy

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
always have the problem or at least the

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
idea like how couldn't you see this for

227
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,240
that much time how could you not see

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
that you were hacked for i don't know

229
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,399
even a year i've seen that happen as

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
well some of the operations are even

231
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
longer

232
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
perhaps the

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,560
the bad guys are in this case quite lazy

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
perhaps they hop from one organization

235
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
to another i'm always quite intrigued on

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
why it takes so much time for the actual

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,640
exploit to emerge

238
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
so then it becomes the panic situation

239
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,519
the company now suddenly realizes oh my

240
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
god i need to do stuff

241
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
but what do you do what do you need to

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
do when you are in this particular

243
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
situation

244
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
you could start running around and

245
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
flapping out your arms and then think

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
okay i can't do anything because well

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
hackers got me or in this case criminals

248
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,080
got you

249
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
but yeah you could take it more

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,279
structured

251
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
now it could be a crisis plan somewhere

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
no i don't know if you actually know

253
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
what a crisis plan is but it would

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
describe all kinds of things and i will

255
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
go into that

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,279
details even more

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
later in the talk but there could be a

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
crisis plan somewhere in a drawer in

259
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
your company

260
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
but where

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
i find it quite amazing that some of the

262
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
companies have no clue that somebody

263
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
already thought about it but now isn't

264
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
working at the company anymore and there

265
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,000
is no crisis plan or is quite old

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
quite amazing that you that sometimes

267
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,399
people miss it

268
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
now emotionally wise what does this do

269
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
with the

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
with the company people

271
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
first what happens is the shock effect

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,040
if you look at the stages of grief the

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
shock is very

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
well

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
depends on how much you actually

276
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
accounted this of course if you are a

277
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
security researcher or a search person

278
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
or a sea search you've seen this effect

279
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,079
more often and then you perhaps go

280
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
through this cycle more quicker and more

281
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
relaxed

282
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
some of the companies try to do

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
something else and try to ignore that

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,560
they are hacked can we hide it

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
how much times did we actually see that

286
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
happen in the past can we actually hide

287
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
that you were hacked

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
well if the company cannot run their

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
services anymore ultimately it will come

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
out

291
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
but a lot of managers try to

292
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
manage it the way that you got hacked

293
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
which is interesting because how do you

294
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,360
manage the hack without touching the

295
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
technology without doing anything just

296
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,680
reboot the machine and hope that the

297
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
fires will go away

298
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
unfortunately that's one of the

299
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,120
illusions

300
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
realizing after that fact that we cannot

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
deny it the first reaction that i

302
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,800
typically see

303
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
in various companies is that they get

304
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,279
angry

305
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
i cannot get hacked i got hacked but

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
they don't really address the problem

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
they

308
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,040
just get angry and are nowhere in any

309
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
business in getting a structured

310
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
solution or towards a structured

311
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
solution

312
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,959
so it's a very common thing to see that

313
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
people get angry and where

314
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
does this anger lead to

315
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,560
unfortunately the poor i.t people

316
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,079
the people that actually have to deal

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,760
with this situation

318
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,279
typically get the rage of management and

319
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,279
i think that's quite a pity

320
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
sometimes you cannot do anything

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
about the situation but you do get the

322
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
rage in the anger of the company for the

323
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
poor souls that are actually are running

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
the infrastructure

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
think about the situation where you

326
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
already stated to management look we

327
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
need more defenses we need more

328
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
investments but it's not coming but when

329
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
it actually happens

330
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
unfortunately you're taking it on the

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,120
wrong side

332
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,360
companies can then

333
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
go into depression mode

334
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
so with that emotion

335
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
you still are not dealing with the

336
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
situation but trying to hide it and in

337
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
this case trying to hide yourself

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
ultimately the realization that

339
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
management or other people in the

340
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
company couldn't do anything about it

341
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
and they just stop and yield

342
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,920
unfortunately this is a very common

343
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,240
emotion a very common effect in a lot of

344
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
companies trying to just hide it away

345
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,479
and again try to ignore the facts

346
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
successful companies

347
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
try to accept that they got hacked and

348
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
try to deal with it and then they try to

349
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
move forward

350
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
and ultimately

351
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
you try to work together

352
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,320
and that's the most effective way of

353
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
actually dealing with such a situation

354
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
now what i mean with that last one is

355
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,000
when you

356
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
have a company that is hacked or got

357
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,519
hacked

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,279
and they're trying to

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
be well not so much as open as possible

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
because you're trying to control the

361
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,120
story but at least you ask for help

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
and that's a complicated thing you got

363
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
hacked you have a problem but now you

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,079
have to ask for assistance either by

365
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
your suppliers or by partners

366
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,720
and it's interesting that some of the

367
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
people are actually good-hearted and

368
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
even on the sunday morning people try to

369
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,399
get into a car go to your company and

370
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
assist you with your business

371
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
it does happen

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
so i hope that people would move

373
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
quicker to these all these emotions

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
and move towards the integration part

375
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,519
because it really

376
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
is a thing that companies would say will

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
deal with detect with all the

378
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,760
administrative things later

379
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,480
let's help you first

380
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
now on the optimistic side

381
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
of the timeline the stock would actually

382
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
see the

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
the thing would actually see the

384
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
situation

385
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
and the formal way of dealing with this

386
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
is that they actually

387
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
described a use case

388
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
and the use case would be a preparation

389
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,560
you prepare a function or a description

390
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
with the formula

391
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
i want to catch

392
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
z a following situation this requires

393
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
the data y

394
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
and

395
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,639
you need

396
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,199
x as stuff in your network perhaps and

397
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,839
it needs to be enabled and after that

398
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
you can execute and do w

399
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
so what are the pitfalls

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
z is not even clear sometimes

401
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
it's interesting that sometimes you say

402
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
oh we want to catch the attacker but you

403
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
have to clearly first define what you

404
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
actually want to catch

405
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,120
what does the attacker look like

406
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
how do you define mower how do you

407
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,600
express it in such a way that you can

408
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,240
actually detect it into your network and

409
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
with what gear do you have to do that

410
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,199
and how does this look like what do you

411
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
want to catch you want to catch a fraud

412
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
case it looks quite different than

413
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,199
malware that spawns from a macro from

414
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,319
word for example

415
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,720
you have to define it first because

416
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,839
otherwise you don't know what you're

417
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,360
dealing with

418
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
another problem that i've seen which is

419
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,279
actually a

420
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,920
common pitfall is that if you have data

421
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
for example you have a system

422
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,360
that

423
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,959
creates logs

424
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
but somewhere the logs need to ship be

425
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,079
shipped to a sock to is to a seam system

426
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,440
for example

427
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
but if the data is then moved through a

428
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
few systems

429
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
the log file could be

430
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
neutered in this case

431
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,839
you cut pieces from the log file because

432
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
you they would transfer you change it to

433
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
json for example you have a log file you

434
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
want to do be modern you change it to

435
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
json but you leave out certain elements

436
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
that were needed to actually get the

437
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
entire use case

438
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
it happens a lot that you then lose data

439
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
in translation it's not just like i

440
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
think it's called in english a birthday

441
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
game that you have one person talking to

442
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,519
the next one talking to the next one

443
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
talking to the next one and the entire

444
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
story starts first with you have an

445
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
apple and suddenly you're in america in

446
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
a hotel which has no relationship

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,800
whatsoever but sometimes that happens

448
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,959
too

449
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,079
now the x would be if you

450
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
if your data is not being delivered at

451
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,600
all

452
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,320
what if you do not have an ids system if

453
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
you don't have an intrusion detection

454
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
system none of this will be even

455
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
detected

456
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,199
and the bad thing would be if you

457
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
actually have an ids but you didn't pay

458
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,400
for the license to actually activate it

459
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
then you have the ids and in some cases

460
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
some

461
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,799
auditors would even state or mistakenly

462
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,760
claim

463
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
you're compliant

464
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,079
but unfortunately it's not doing

465
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
anything luckily modern auditors

466
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
actually do check if the effects that

467
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,720
you intend for actually end up but yeah

468
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,919
it happens

469
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,799
a lot that the machines are there

470
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,640
but it's not doing anything

471
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
or not at least the things that you

472
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,678
would intend it to do

473
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
w would describe which steps are needed

474
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
to be taken after you've actually

475
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
had a detection of the use case

476
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
these things are called playbooks

477
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,559
and they need to exist

478
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,640
and they need to be followed now these

479
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,280
are two important things

480
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,440
i've seen a lot of cool situations where

481
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,919
they have everything described they have

482
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
a sock they detect it everything is

483
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,919
turning red there's an alarm

484
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
but no follow-up

485
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
and in some cases you obviously have

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
alarm fatigue this is not this this is

487
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
when you have an alarm you have an alert

488
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,840
but you have no clue what to do after

489
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,799
that

490
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,240
now you're a cool security guy but

491
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
nothing is taking place with respect to

492
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
actions

493
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,679
now these playbooks

494
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,799
are used

495
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,120
to tell each other what to do so

496
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
who do you need

497
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,240
to

498
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
communicate to

499
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
how does your use case escalate to

500
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
management

501
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,039
who else should know about what you just

502
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,679
detected

503
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,960
operations

504
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,600
networking cert people

505
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
if you have a alert that goes off how do

506
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
you

507
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
ensure that the right people are now

508
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,320
starting up with some kind of activity

509
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
and consider

510
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,200
also what to do out of office hours

511
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
i work at the government i'm very

512
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,640
transparent in that and otherwise you

513
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
could have looked that up on linkedin

514
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
anyway

515
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,840
but i know that having services out of

516
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
office hours is something that you

517
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
really have to discuss and bring to the

518
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
table because it's not automatic

519
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,679
it's also something that is with

520
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
commercial stock environments it's

521
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
something that you have to pay for if

522
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,559
people are actively on duty looking at

523
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
the screens and looking at the alerts

524
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
and then having a discussion okay what

525
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,960
should i actually do and how should you

526
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
deal with the situation after office

527
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
hours

528
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,760
and

529
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,840
do you need to trigger suppliers i would

530
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,679
always say yes because you always are

531
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,200
engaging with suppliers but how do you

532
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,559
do that did you actually create a

533
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,960
a mail list for that do you have phone

534
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
numbers for this how does this work this

535
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
is something that you have to describe

536
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
as well because otherwise it will end up

537
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
that you know your company knows about

538
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
it but you're completely dependent on

539
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,400
your suppliers and the suppliers have no

540
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
clue that you are having or seeing a

541
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
problem in your environment

542
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
and last but not least regulators

543
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,000
if you are working in vital

544
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
infrastructure for example

545
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
you need to contact the regulators if

546
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,360
certain cases apply

547
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
and how do you know that this applies

548
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
well this definitely is something that

549
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
you also need to figure out first what

550
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
does apply to you when do you have to

551
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
actually call the regulator on what

552
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,840
notice and then of course who is going

553
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
to do that

554
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
and how do you prepare the person to do

555
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,159
it i'm not really sure if you

556
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,840
could think about a ceo for example take

557
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,159
talking about you got hacked okay but

558
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,640
the regulators also ask for particular

559
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,760
information to be shared if you then uh

560
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
yeah have just your ceo stating i'm the

561
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
important guy i'm gonna

562
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
have a talk with the with this regulator

563
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
very cool but then yeah you have to

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
prepare for that and train him properly

565
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
because otherwise it would be a very

566
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
interesting story and your company will

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
be

568
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
hurt by that

569
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
another pitfall an idea and a thing that

570
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
you actually really need to do is log

571
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,600
everything that you encounter

572
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,840
not just physically like okay the

573
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
technical things you have log files and

574
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
you log stuff no no log your personal

575
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,559
actions and activities

576
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
and time stamp them properly

577
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,280
who did what

578
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
and the important thing is

579
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
stuff could get out of hand very very

580
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
quickly

581
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
and it's quite common that somebody

582
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,000
would ask you wait a minute what did you

583
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
do

584
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
five days

585
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,360
in the past at a certain time about

586
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
topic x

587
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
do you have the recollection of that

588
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,039
while you've been stressed out many days

589
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,360
trying to save your company

590
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
but somebody asked something very

591
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
particular very technical or very

592
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,400
detailed and you don't have a log about

593
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
that

594
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,520
that's really complicated

595
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
and think about how to structure these

596
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
info this information there are tools to

597
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
actually help you

598
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,360
you could just use a template

599
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,679
that creates a markdown file for example

600
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
and make it very easy for you but there

601
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
are also tools that can actually help

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
you okay what kind of decision was made

603
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
by whom and what kind of information do

604
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
we have to pass through or should wait

605
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
also think about the situation when you

606
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
are collecting data and perhaps you're a

607
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,159
man in the middle somewhere and you have

608
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,360
to wait for other teams to answer the

609
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
the actions or information that they're

610
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
trying to gather

611
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
so think about the situation where you

612
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,880
have a team

613
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,799
other teams need to

614
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
communicate and well who's doing what

615
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,840
and if you have multiple threads of

616
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
activities going on things will get

617
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
complicated in that dimension too

618
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,640
so the hint is create cheat sheets

619
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,799
i just talked with the herald here and

620
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,080
also got

621
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
definitely the hint the cheat sheet

622
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
matter and i would definitely recommend

623
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,720
in a stressful situation to focus a lot

624
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,919
on all the details that could happen

625
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,000
include basic things

626
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
it sounds stupid but if you're running a

627
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,000
crisis situation for multiple days

628
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,240
please on first on the first day think

629
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,880
about the food and drinks and snacks for

630
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
all the people that you have there it's

631
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,279
the same thing that we have over here on

632
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,919
the camp drink sufficient water it's

633
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,440
something that you actually should push

634
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,559
for everybody who's making lots of hours

635
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,120
to actually do that because you can have

636
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
fatigue

637
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,039
it's not uncommon that people get burned

638
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,000
out based on a crisis situation in your

639
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
company

640
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
and a burnout typically lasts for at

641
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,679
least five to ten years after that

642
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,799
incident

643
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
think about that

644
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,720
person is trying to save your company

645
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,039
but you didn't take care or

646
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,240
shifted

647
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,559
to another person

648
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,320
that first one got

649
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,360
burned out and now has a health issue

650
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,479
for many years to come

651
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
clean it this checklist and fix it

652
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
regularly make it something that you put

653
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
into a monthly or quarterly or yearly

654
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
well yearly would be quite long let's

655
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,840
say quarterly monthly quarterly

656
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
um uh thing to me to clean it up because

657
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,159
phone numbers change contacts change

658
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,799
regulations change and your company

659
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,400
changes

660
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
it's really important to do this

661
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,279
now some of the pitfalls that could

662
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,400
happen

663
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
is that you only focus on just in only

664
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,400
the technical things

665
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,559
i have a crisis my windows machine got

666
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,480
hacked oh it's also the active

667
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
directory and the storage and blah blah

668
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,840
blah but what does that actually mean

669
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
perhaps this is an isolated environment

670
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
and the entire company doesn't really

671
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
need to know that you have this problem

672
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,039
only the crisis teams perhaps

673
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,120
but if you do not talk

674
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
beyond the technical level if you do not

675
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
talk okay what does this actually mean

676
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
for the organization

677
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,880
uh in those kinds of terms and effects

678
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
then also it becomes very complicated to

679
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
talk with management about the situation

680
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
that you have

681
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
if you talk

682
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
or need to talk to uh to management

683
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
please do that quickly as quickly as

684
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
possible do not hesitate to inform them

685
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,440
um

686
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,600
i've see at least i know from experience

687
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,640
that it it's quite common that you have

688
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,039
a technical team and they're hesitant to

689
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
talk all these about the technical

690
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,799
things that are happening now to a

691
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
management team

692
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
because well let's face it we have a

693
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,520
different way of expressing

694
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,480
problems if you only use technical terms

695
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,840
the management will never understand

696
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
what's going on

697
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
doesn't know about active directory just

698
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,799
has problems with logging in

699
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,919
this is something that you have to

700
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
involve

701
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
because then you can also train them and

702
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
tell them okay this is actually what's

703
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,559
going on perhaps even teach them some

704
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,279
technical things

705
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
what if your company doesn't even have a

706
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,840
crisis team or know about it that's also

707
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,320
a problem what if you have

708
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
people designated for the crisis

709
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
situation but the problem is that the

710
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,679
technical people don't even know whom

711
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
the crisis team is because this was

712
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
decided by management but never

713
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
communicated

714
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
again don't forget the regulators for

715
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,159
example how do you deal with that

716
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,840
perhaps you are obligated to actually

717
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
tell them quickly within a certain

718
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
amount of hours

719
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,279
that you have a problem

720
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
and perhaps but this is again

721
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,600
it depends a bit on what country you're

722
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
in and what the actual laws and

723
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,640
regulations are but sometimes for some

724
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,279
of the hacks at for example vital

725
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,640
infrastructure it's not uncommon that

726
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
you have to involve law enforcement

727
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,679
quick enough

728
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,520
and if you don't do that you might be

729
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,840
sued

730
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,919
crisis teams need to be formed and

731
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
unfortunately that also doesn't really

732
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,679
happen that often because typically a

733
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,200
company would say well that's not

734
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
something that i should think about the

735
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
ceo will be the chief and the chair of

736
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
the crisis team and then we'll move on

737
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,919
and typically you have your your

738
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,640
management people doing it if you have a

739
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
larger company

740
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
a dedicated crisis team might be formed

741
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
and people from the company might get

742
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
selected for crisis situations if you

743
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
even have a larger company than that you

744
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
have a dedicated crisis teams and people

745
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
are getting trained continuously because

746
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
that's their duty

747
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,919
but yeah

748
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
so does it actually make sense that you

749
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,120
actually selected the right people

750
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
what if the crisis increases in informed

751
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
do all the decisions make sense that you

752
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
actually took

753
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,840
i've seen situations where a decision

754
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,679
increased the problem

755
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,919
of for the company how do you deal with

756
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,000
that situations

757
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
so if you don't know about the results

758
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,200
of whatever effects and whatever

759
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
decisions you make you'll be in a

760
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,918
problem

761
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
create a feedback loop for example

762
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,440
if you have technical people that know

763
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,679
what the consequences of a decision will

764
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
be i mean let's face it how much of the

765
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,200
of a time did we have a problem see it

766
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
and then figure out okay you have now

767
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
made it you've now made a decision and

768
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,919
we know that this decision is the wrong

769
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
decision

770
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
see some smiles okay so one of the

771
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,399
things that i could see is that if you

772
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,480
have a situation where you know this is

773
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,000
going to be really bad you're just

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
screwing it up if you continue with this

775
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
it helps to to

776
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,600
at least inform them

777
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
at least once

778
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
hopefully have an intermediate person

779
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,480
and this is something that i stole from

780
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,399
betty bear for example at least a term

781
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,200
for it the nerd flies try or nerd

782
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
whisper in this case somebody who has

783
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,919
oh hello beard

784
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
somebody who has the capabilities of

785
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
actually making the translation between

786
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
management and the technical things

787
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
because well people are not talking

788
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,159
about it about the same problem with the

789
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
same language and the same words and

790
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
terms you may need to make these

791
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,399
translations

792
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,399
actually looked at that uh

793
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
thing it's it's really important and the

794
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
successful crisis teams and crisis

795
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,640
situations were assisted because of

796
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
people who make these jumps between

797
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,559
management language and the technical

798
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,520
guys

799
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,559
and ultimately if you

800
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,840
make the decision or make a bad decision

801
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,960
that is a relative term

802
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,000
i've put here sudo do it

803
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
shell script and the what i mean here is

804
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
in some cases management might have the

805
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,399
total overview of the company

806
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,640
while you know okay this entire business

807
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
will die

808
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
and perhaps the management will say well

809
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
let it

810
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
boggles my mind at times because well i

811
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
would try to save the entire company but

812
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,760
sometimes

813
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
parts of the company might be well

814
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,559
just sacrificed

815
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,000
for the greater good of the rest of the

816
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
company

817
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
this is something that it needs to be

818
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
communicated well between management and

819
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
technical teams

820
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
because this doesn't really add up

821
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,360
because you're trying to save

822
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,080
the rest of the infrastructure

823
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,880
we're

824
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
dealing with a thing

825
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,159
let's call it a digital crime scene

826
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,120
and you have to take care of your

827
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,479
infrastructure but

828
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,640
did you train yourself

829
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
not just as a sys admin but as a

830
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
forensics and e-discovery expert

831
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,559
how do you save evidence if you want to

832
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
go

833
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,399
if you want to

834
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,399
ensure that you have evidence to

835
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
share to law enforcement or some other

836
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,360
company or some regulator

837
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,679
are you certified for this

838
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,559
and would i really take this daily

839
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,320
because i've seen at the companies that

840
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,679
i've worked for

841
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,080
that if you are certified you know that

842
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,559
there is a certain degree of skills that

843
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
goes into it to actually get the

844
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,360
certifications

845
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,559
i know that the forensics and

846
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,559
e-discovery

847
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,960
trainings are quite tough

848
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,320
and good

849
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,240
and it really helps that you don't wing

850
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
it because if you wing it and just throw

851
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,919
away a virtual machine and just yeah

852
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
just reboot it and then obviously the

853
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
malware is gone but also the evidence is

854
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
gone now watch

855
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,360
this is something that you have to take

856
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,678
care of

857
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,760
oh

858
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,000
this slide should have been a build up

859
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,679
into all the pictures so let's just

860
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,279
emphasize the pictures that you don't

861
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,039
see because they overlap and i screwed

862
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,080
up

863
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,960
this

864
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,200
is a chinese meal this is what we call

865
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
at least in dutch chinese meal i'm not

866
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,640
really sure how do you translate this

867
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
it's about food

868
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,960
ensure again that you take care of

869
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,679
nourishment for all the people involved

870
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,159
this is a picture a part of a picture is

871
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,240
almost like well it's almost like a game

872
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,840
what is this well this is a hotel room

873
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,240
consider putting your people

874
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,000
into a hotel room

875
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
close to the company

876
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,600
and give them rest and air

877
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,799
the picture that's really gone is

878
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
you pay for the taxi cab to actually get

879
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
them to the hotel

880
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,519
and the flowers are not meant for the

881
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,360
technician just per se but also for

882
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,399
the man the wife partner of the

883
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,880
technician because if the technician is

884
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
making hours like 2

885
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,679
12 hours 14 hours a day

886
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,559
to save your company that also adds a

887
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,919
lot of stress

888
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,880
to

889
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,799
the household of the people that are

890
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,840
saving your company

891
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
oh look tax cap

892
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,039
that part worked

893
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,080
screwed up in file versions okay

894
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,960
communicate and be honest

895
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
be like the boy scouts let's take some

896
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,720
inspiration from the people that are

897
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,600
here

898
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,320
or just left the fields

899
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,559
be honest to customers

900
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,480
be honest to your own teams

901
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,960
to the company to management and any

902
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,480
other organization that could help you

903
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,599
the six most successful situations where

904
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
a company or other organization ended up

905
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,440
in with is how they can control the news

906
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
denial is one of the worst things that

907
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,639
you could do ultimately somebody

908
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,320
will

909
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
unintentionally intentionally talk to

910
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,000
the press

911
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,079
spill some information and now your

912
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,918
company is

913
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,320
one step behind and you do not have the

914
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
control over the storyline anymore

915
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,599
customers will know that you have a

916
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
problem services not are not delivered

917
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,760
goods are not delivered who knows who

918
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,639
cares

919
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,719
they will find out you have a problem

920
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,000
problem within your company

921
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
be as transmitted as well to all the

922
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,839
people who actually work at the company

923
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,599
that you have a problem also try to be

924
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,640
as transm transparent as possible that

925
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,359
perhaps not everybody has to be in shock

926
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,079
or at least knows what to do

927
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
because that's also a thing sometimes

928
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,680
they say okay we have a problem the huge

929
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,200
problem and everybody in the company is

930
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,079
now involved or at least stressed out

931
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,920
please control how you communicate this

932
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
but be honest

933
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,119
be honest to management as well this

934
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
goes from everybody within the company

935
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,839
because if the management is hidden away

936
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,960
from

937
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,680
uh from the problem that you face

938
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,800
they cannot allocate additional

939
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
money for the things that they uh

940
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,359
i mean resources and uh allocate and

941
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,359
help you with that because well somebody

942
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,800
needs to pay for the taxi cabs in the

943
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
hotels for example

944
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
and with respect to the organizations

945
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
that can help you yeah there are a lot

946
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
of they think about suppliers think

947
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,720
about other companies that could assist

948
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,160
you right away

949
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,640
if you are transparent towards either

950
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
suppliers or people in your in the

951
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,240
supply chain

952
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
they can assist and be at least on guard

953
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
for you as well or even help you with

954
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
resources that they have and can offer

955
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
so i'd like to close

956
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,839
my talk with

957
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,920
believe in the happy ending part of the

958
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,240
story here because you

959
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,440
can actually influence a lot about how a

960
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,520
crisis is developing

961
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,640
regardless of what type of duty you have

962
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,960
either from the security team

963
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,040
or from the technical teams that you

964
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,960
have a responsibility for the

965
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
infrastructure itself

966
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
suppliers management

967
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,880
csos everybody can pitch in and have

968
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
a big part in how you deal with a crisis

969
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
situation

970
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,839
do not underestimate your position in

971
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,560
that

972
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,320
and in that i'd like to conclude

973
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,220
[Music]

974
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,320
[Applause]

977
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,240
opportunity

989
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,480
do we have a question already

990
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,599
we do not so please the front microphone

991
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,599
hello thanks for the

992
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,680
presentation my question is about

993
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,920
companies helping each other because

994
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,839
i've been working on that with

995
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,440
one of my customers

996
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
and

997
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,480
really looking towards who can help us

998
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,839
here problem often is legal and i have

999
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,680
been working with

1000
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
legal companies trying to get this set

1001
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
up

1002
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,560
but it's really hard

1003
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
um

1004
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,000
so yeah you preferably want to sign some

1005
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,920
things and do this when everything is

1006
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
like your first flight when it's a happy

1007
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,720
picture with the sun shining um but then

1008
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
there's no priority do you have any

1009
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,560
experience or tips on

1010
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,599
how to get there yeah so

1011
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,720
it depends a bit on what the

1012
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,560
relationship is between the companies of

1013
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,760
course

1014
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,920
but for example in any of the fields

1015
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
either crisis situations or this you can

1016
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,040
have a part of a contract for example so

1017
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,480
i'm not really sure what kind what type

1018
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
of interaction between the company's

1019
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,560
companies do you mean are they equal or

1020
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,680
peers

1021
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,359
yeah equals peer groups yeah so that's

1022
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,800
do they also

1023
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,760
yeah well

1024
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,160
try to get into the same yeah do they

1025
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,839
have the same customers yeah um

1026
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,680
yeah well it wasn't shipping so it's

1027
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,480
yeah

1028
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,640
it's either one ship or the other for a

1029
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,720
company so yeah they're

1030
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,280
really competing yeah i would then focus

1031
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,000
on the fact that you are trying to

1032
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,079
offer services and not so much focus on

1033
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,599
the crisis itself

1034
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
i want to offer services can we

1035
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,400
negotiate in okay i'm i'm i'm having uh

1036
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,599
i'm having resources to offer for you uh

1037
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,680
i can also offer my resources to you to

1038
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,160
the to the other company and actually

1039
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,480
could yeah well share supply lines

1040
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
perhaps right yeah maybe some kind of

1041
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
commercial uh

1042
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,000
way of thinking about it

1043
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
yeah well

1044
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
ultimately it boils down to what kind of

1045
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
contract and how much you then pay for

1046
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
each other to save

1047
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,520
other people right if you take a dns uh

1048
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,359
this is the for example for dns

1049
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,440
infrastructure i know from at least from

1050
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,200
the older days uh probably to do it

1051
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,000
still again still now that you yeah

1052
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,240
share the name services and facilities

1053
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,560
and that if one goes down you could the

1054
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
other one can take over this is

1055
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,640
something that you could also do with

1056
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,680
more physical supply lines yep thank you

1057
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,839
yeah let's talk after two yeah thanks

1058
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,119
yesterday where will you be hanging out

1059
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,960
after the talk will you be able to be

1060
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
approached after the talk by people

1061
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,640
thanks

1062
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
uh yeah i will be probably

1063
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,319
well on that side

1064
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,000
to have on that side of the tent very

1065
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,520
good yeah because this is where my

1066
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,640
bicycle is

1067
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
back blue front microphone please go

1068
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,119
ahead yes i have two questions the first

1069
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,359
question is what is the largest pizza

1070
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,960
order you ever did to take care of

1071
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,200
people running an incident for you so

1072
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,520
you can repeat what is the largest pizza

1073
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,280
order you ever did

1074
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,960
to root

1075
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,760
well uh i didn't order that that set of

1076
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
pizzas uh somebody else ordered the

1077
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,000
pizzas i think

1078
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
if you count pizzas

1079
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,520
i'm not really sure when it was but we

1080
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,280
16

1081
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
decent amount

1082
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,520
um and my second question is uh also

1083
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,000
somewhat more serious um because you

1084
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
talk as a company um

1085
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
you you at one point you get hacked and

1086
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,240
you get into the unhappy flow

1087
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,920
if you have as an outside attacker you

1088
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,480
report the problem and the company

1089
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
immediately spins into denial and send

1090
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,680
lawyers on you and does legal threats

1091
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,720
um can you help the company so you just

1092
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,960
write directly to the ceo or what do you

1093
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,880
recommend in that case

1094
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,800
uh

1095
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,520
well hack the system

1096
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
i've seen situations that it actually

1097
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,960
worked

1098
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,200
to send a comment

1099
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,280
or a direct message

1100
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,960
to the ceo of the company on twitter

1101
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,119
that well depends on how active the

1102
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,200
person is on twitter because typically

1103
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,760
it's the communications team

1104
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,640
on behalf of somebody else who's on the

1105
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,920
social media

1106
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,480
but if the person itself

1107
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,599
is on the social media and managing its

1108
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,359
own messages

1109
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,240
then definitely you will be on the some

1110
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
kind of uh yeah your email or your

1111
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,960
message will definitely be lifted into a

1112
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,000
company mail with states from the ceo

1113
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,200
fix this

1114
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,200
because this could get out of hand okay

1115
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,079
it's not the best way of doing it

1116
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,119
but it definitely works

1117
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,599
thank you are there any more questions

1118
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,440
i believe it's a very unique opportunity

1119
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
to ask the chief eventual security

1120
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
officer of the dutch health ministry uh

1121
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,760
some more topics oh yeah they're over

1122
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,720
there

1123
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
yes also the next talk will be uh from a

1124
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,480
different ciso it's interesting it's

1125
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
like a lineup here please go ahead front

1126
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,599
microphone we're very open here

1127
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,319
my question is about uh

1128
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,160
when the hack comes through the front

1129
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,440
door

1130
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,319
instead of over a computer network

1131
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,480
so how would that make the situation

1132
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,000
different

1133
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,160
i don't think it would with respect to

1134
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,319
how you deal with the crisis it's just

1135
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,200
that you need different steps

1136
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,000
yeah that to take for example if the

1137
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
example would be a usb stick enters the

1138
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,640
front door then you have the malware on

1139
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,520
the system basically it starts more or

1140
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,079
less on the same page

1141
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,400
the only thing that is different is its

1142
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,119
usb stick triggers now malware is on the

1143
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,040
system and you now have to deal with

1144
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
that

1145
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,280
but

1146
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,920
it's almost the same as the email

1147
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,160
starts a process and then you have

1148
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,760
things on the same network in the same

1149
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,599
systems

1150
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,599
so i wouldn't really see that much of a

1151
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,560
difference i would definitely

1152
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,359
have a talk in all the preparations look

1153
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
a virus could indeed come in through the

1154
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,400
front door physically

1155
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,560
it's something that happens yeah

1156
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,839
but i don't see the big difference

1157
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
i would just treat it uh the same

1158
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,359
because it's more easy

1159
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,760
thank you yeah all the well-known uh

1160
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,000
ethernet port in the floor tank of the

1161
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
waiting area that is in the same vlan as

1162
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,440
everything else

1163
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
yeah that's something that well that's

1164
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,680
actually an interesting thing

1165
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,640
i always walk around the more open

1166
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
premises like for example the restaurant

1167
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
of a company might also accept visitors

1168
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800
right i always take a look at the

1169
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,640
ethernet ports in the wall and then well

1170
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,720
i'm not doing it anymore but it might

1171
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,800
have happened that i just

1172
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
put in and see do i get an ip address do

1173
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,119
i get ethernet is linked up that would

1174
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,440
be interesting

1175
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,280
there are some surprising things to find

1176
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,000
if one does that regularly but uh this

1177
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,640
was an awesome talk and i would think he

1178
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,759
deserved a huge round of applause

1179
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,090
[Applause]

1180
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,480
you
