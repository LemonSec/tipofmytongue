00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,279
this talk is titled the best worst thing

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,800
and he will talk about inventions that

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
change the world and our society but

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,920
what if they fail if

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
there is an outage of some kind of

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
critical network and he will speak about

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
networks in a broader sense not only

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,840
data networks so with this announcement

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
here is the best worst thing from mikko

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,719
hipponen big round of applause

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,920
what can i say

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
thank you for coming

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
indeed

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
my name is mikkom and this is my 31st

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
year working with information security

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,680
or

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,239
computers privacy everything connected

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
and i spent the pandemic time

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
writing a book about the things i've

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,439
learned this book

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,960
right here comes out in a week

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,880
and in this book i tried to think

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
through

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
the revolutions that we've been living

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
through because that's what we're doing

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
right now we're living through a digital

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
revolution and the thing about

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
revolutions is that it's kind of hard to

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,759
see

31
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,520
what's happening when you are in the

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
middle of these revolutions yourself

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
it's easier to see the importance of the

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
revolutions when you take a longer

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,840
perspective like imagining a future

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
historian writing a history book about

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
our time

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,560
with that kind of perspective it would

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,439
become obvious that the thing

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,560
that we

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
will be remembered for always forever

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,240
is that we were the first generations in

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
mankind's history who went online

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
mankind

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
walked this planet for a hundred

46
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
thousand years offline

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,758
during our time we went online and we

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,400
will be online forever we just you and

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
me we just happened to be born

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
into this specific time when this shift

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,040
happened

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,080
and it is a big shift

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
and when big shifts happen

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,319
they bring great benefits

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
and they also bring

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
great new risks

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
the thing that i keep repeating in my

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
book is that the internet is the best

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
and the worst thing

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
to happen during our time

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
the upsides are easy to see i mean

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
that's why we're all here i think we all

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,280
love the internet i know i love

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,239
the internet it's the best thing ever

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
all this connectivity all this

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,239
possibility of making connections around

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
the world

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
how geography no longer restricts us

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,200
how entertainment or connectivity or

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
business can be done globally

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
great huge upsides

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
but with the upsides we get the

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
downsides

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
completely new kinds of risks

75
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,120
completely new kinds of crime

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
when the internet was young

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
parents were warning their children that

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
you know don't go and

79
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
believe everything you read on the

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
internet

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
now

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
25 years later

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
that it's it seems obvious to me that

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
it's the parents

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
who should be much more careful about

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
believing what they read on the internet

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
not the kids the parents because parents

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
are the ones believing all these goddamn

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
conspiracy theories and falling for

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,599
every single influence operation thrown

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
by any in intelligence agency on the

92
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
planet

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
internet works great in distributing

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
information whether the information is

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,560
right

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
or wrong

97
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
and of course we have the huge shift

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
in crime

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
so i've been thinking about this shift

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
through my career

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,079
i started working

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
in a small helsinki based

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
security startup in 1991.

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
back then the viruses we were analyzing

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
were almost trivial compared to what

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
they were today and the spreading

107
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
mechanisms well some of us still

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
remember how viruses used to spread in

109
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
the early 1990s and now this is

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
it feels laughable

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
that malware which requires people to

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
carry it physically from one computer to

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
another could actually become

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,400
a global problem but these kind of

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
viruses did become a global problem

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,639
in their time in the early 1990s

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
so crime

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
before the internet

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
was local

120
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
today crime

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
is global

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,039
internet has taken away geography in all

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,160
the good

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
good things but also in all the bad

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
things at the same time

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
before the internet you had to worry

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
about

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
the criminals living in your city

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
today you have to worry about the

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
criminals in your city but also

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
you have to worry about the criminals

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
wherever on the planet

133
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,960
there is no local anymore

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
one great example on how internet has

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
changed the world for the better and for

136
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
the worse is how

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
the world of minorities has changed

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
thanks to the internet

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
before the internet

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
if you belonged to a minority

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
you were pretty alone

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
that's what minorities mean you're

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
different

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
and here i mean all kinds of minorities

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
certainly people who belong into sexual

146
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,440
minorities but also let's say people who

147
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,479
have

148
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
rare hobbies

149
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
before the internet if you had a rare

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
hobby you were probably the only person

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,199
in your town who had that hobby you knew

152
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,520
no one who shared the hobby

153
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,479
with you then internet comes around

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
and you realize that you're not alone

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
there's

156
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
thousands of people like you they are

157
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
just not close to you but you can now

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
find them and reach them out through the

159
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,199
internet and we people

160
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,840
are social animals we like to be around

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
people like us we like to share what we

162
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,960
do we like to get support from people

163
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
like us

164
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
and that's great

165
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,120
and then we have the downside

166
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
which is exactly the same phenomenon

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
when it applies to destructive

168
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
minorities

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
what do i mean by destructive minorities

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,960
well

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
people who are planning school shootings

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
for example that would be a destructive

173
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
minority and they will find exactly the

174
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
same kind of support from their online

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
communities

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
as a person with a rare hobby would find

177
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,160
for their from their support communities

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
people who are planning suicide or

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
self-harm or who are starving themselves

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
people who want to join a terrorist

181
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
organization people who are on the verge

182
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
of radicalization they

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
will find destructive support

184
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
from the internet just like

185
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
people who need

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
support for their productive good

187
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,360
hobbies or because they belong to a

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
minority

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
i mean we can't take one side of the

190
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,199
coin and leave out the other side

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
internet is the best

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
and the worst thing happening during our

193
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
time

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
and technology

195
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
is not neutral

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
it's almost too easy for us

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
to just keep repeating the fact that

198
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
technology is just a tool

199
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
it can be used for good it can be used

200
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
for bad

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,199
now

202
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,560
i agree

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
and i don't

204
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
i both agree but i also don't because

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
there's plenty of examples

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,800
of technologies that we have invented

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,639
which are mostly used for bad things

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
let's take an example

209
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
all right crypto currencies let's pick a

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,799
cryptocurrency let's say monero for

211
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
example

212
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,200
now of course monero can be used to

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
trade and to buy goods and to

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,519
send money from one place to another

215
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,000
sure absolutely can be used but the vast

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
majority of the use that i see in my

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,279
profession is illegal and evil use

218
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
people buying and selling illegal things

219
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
the vast majority of the trade with some

220
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
of the cryptocurrencies we see out there

221
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
is

222
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
being used for things like that and the

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
thing about technological innovation is

224
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,839
that once we've invented

225
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,959
something we cannot uninvent it

226
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,480
we cannot put the ga the cat

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,200
back in the bag once it's out it's out

228
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
the only way we can restrict

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
the usage of innovations

230
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
is by making them illegal

231
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
so once we invented uncrackable strong

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
encryption

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
and then realize that bad people can use

234
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
uncrackable strong encryption

235
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
there's nothing we can do about it

236
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
except to try to make it illegal which

237
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
won't work

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
because us law-abiding citizens we

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
wouldn't then break the laws well i

240
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,519
guess some of us would but

241
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
criminals of course are criminals

242
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
because they break the laws

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
we cannot uninvent

244
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
things

245
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
so where are we headed

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
what's the future ahead of us

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,959
in my job i've

248
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
for many years

249
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
tried to do the forecasting of the near

250
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,000
future what's going to happen in the

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
next two years

252
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
four years that's hard

253
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
it's almost always prone to failure

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
what's easy

255
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
to do is to give a forecast of the long

256
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,200
future what's going to happen in 20

257
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
years 30 years 40 years

258
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,680
that's easy

259
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
that's actually really obvious all we

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
have to do

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
is to look at the past

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
and see where computing and technology

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
used to be where are we today and where

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
are we headed

265
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
computing

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,040
processing bandwidth storage

267
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,959
has been getting better and better and

268
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,839
bigger and faster for decades and

269
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
cheaper

270
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
you look at the computers we had 20

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
years ago 30 years ago you look at the

272
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
supercomputers we had 20 years ago and

273
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
you're right now carrying

274
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
a super computer in your pocket today

275
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
the processing power of your iphone or

276
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,880
android device is faster than a craig 2

277
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
supercomputer and this runs on a goddamn

278
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
battery

279
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
think about that 20 years and the

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
supercomputer which took the whole room

281
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
is now in everybody's pockets

282
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
grade 2 cost millions

283
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
these aren't cheap but it's not millions

284
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
so with that it's obvious where we had

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
it we are headed towards a future

286
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,640
where we very concretely and in

287
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,920
practical terms we'll be embracing

288
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,399
limitless computing

289
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
everyone will have access to

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
unlimited processing power

291
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
unlimited storage

292
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
and unlimited bandwidth

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
for free

294
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,839
unlimited processing power unlimited

295
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
storage unlimited bandwidth for free

296
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,200
well

297
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
maybe not exactly free and maybe not

298
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
exactly unlimited but close enough

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
that's where we hit it the way we can

300
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
think about it is that you would be

301
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
given the i don't know biggest possible

302
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,839
aws instance

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
with unlimited storage and bandwidth and

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,160
you would pay pennies

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,639
per month that's what i'm speaking about

306
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,160
that's where we headed that's pretty

307
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
obvious the direction where we hit it

308
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
when we will be there

309
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
nobody knows for sure but

310
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
in couple of decades it's it's going to

311
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
happen

312
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
and that's a pretty

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
powerful

314
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,399
thing to think about because for us

315
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,560
creators designers coders it opens up a

316
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
world with no limits

317
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
the question we can ask for ourselves is

318
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,200
what would you build

319
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
if there would be no limits

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
what would you build

321
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
if

322
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
if you would have access to limitless

323
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,000
computing

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
what would you build if you didn't have

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
to worry about costs

326
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
or that it takes a lot of processing

327
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,160
power or bandwidth a lot of storage what

328
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
would you build that's the future where

329
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
we're going

330
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
so what's the downside

331
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
well the downside is

332
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
the better

333
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,360
the internet is the more connectivity we

334
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
have

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,240
the more mandatory it becomes

336
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
internet today

337
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
and internet connectivity

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
it's not yet mandatory

339
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
it's really nice to have but it's not

340
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,079
mandatory it's not mandatory for our

341
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,638
society

342
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
if the internet would go down

343
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
here

344
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,800
in this country in the netherlands

345
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
right now and stay down

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,800
for a week

347
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
it would be very expensive

348
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,360
very painful very nasty

349
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
but the society would survive

350
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
factories would recover they would carry

351
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
on functioning

352
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
planes would continue flying trains

353
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,079
would continue running

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
but eventually that will not no longer

355
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
be the case

356
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
and we know this because we have earlier

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
examples of similar innovations which

358
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
were so good that they then became

359
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,120
mandatory

360
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
think about electricity

361
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
electricity and electric grids

362
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
were taken into use in most

363
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,040
western countries around 150 years ago

364
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
today

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
electric rates are completely monitoring

366
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
if electricity would go down here in

367
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
netherlands and stay down for a week it

368
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
wouldn't just be painful and expensive

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
people would start dying

370
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
maybe not in a week but if it would stay

371
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
down longer that's exactly what starts

372
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,600
happening

373
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,079
why because for 150 years we've been

374
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
building our societies assuming that

375
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
there will always be electricity

376
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
there will always be

377
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,639
electric grid which runs everything

378
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
around us and today everything we buy

379
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,560
requires electricity

380
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
everything we buy we either plug into

381
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
the wall or recharge their batteries

382
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
from the electric grid

383
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,160
so eventually

384
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,959
during our lifetimes connectivity

385
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,560
will be as mandatory as electricity

386
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
connectivity will be as mandatory as

387
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
electricity this is what's happening

388
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
during our lifetimes

389
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,600
and it's the right choice even though

390
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
it's a bit scary it's still the right

391
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
choice to make

392
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
our great grandfathers made the right

393
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,839
choice when they embrace the electricity

394
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,560
we

395
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
are making the right choice by embracing

396
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
connectivity

397
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,600
the other option is worse we definitely

398
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,079
should go towards the digital revolution

399
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,920
and towards connectivity even though it

400
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
will then become mandatory just like

401
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
electricity is already mandatory but at

402
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
least we should be aware

403
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
that we are now making this call you and

404
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,399
me

405
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
we are making this decision for all

406
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,079
future generations

407
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,040
it's happening right now

408
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,720
and part of this revolution is

409
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
the fact that all devices

410
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
start to require connectivity

411
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,279
we speak about these smart devices

412
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
and yes i am the father of the hypno law

413
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
if it's smart it's vulnerable

414
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,160
the typical example i use for that is

415
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,120
my watch i have an old watch

416
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,920
20 years old

417
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,079
it's mechanical contains no chips

418
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,079
contains no connectivity

419
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
how do you hack my watch

420
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
well you don't

421
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
you just don't because there's nothing

422
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,880
to hack

423
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,920
then you look at smart watches

424
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
are they hackable well of course they're

425
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
hackable

426
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
they might be hard to hack but they run

427
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,119
code they have connectivity and they run

428
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
code of course they can be hacked that's

429
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
the

430
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,559
pessimistic outcome of the human law

431
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,079
when we add functionality and

432
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,079
connectivity to everyday devices they

433
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
become vulnerable

434
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,919
and there's nothing we can stop

435
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
there's nothing we can do to stop that

436
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
the reasons why everything is going

437
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,799
online are way beyond our reach

438
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,880
some devices go online to give us

439
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
functionality

440
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
some devices go online only to collect

441
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
data

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
because the vendors building these

443
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,919
devices know that data is money and

444
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,919
money is data

445
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,240
and the more they can collect data the

446
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
richer the companies will become and

447
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,799
this means that eventually every device

448
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,600
will be online

449
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
and that also means that we're

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,120
increasing

451
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,020
complexity

452
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,320
[Music]

453
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
complexity

454
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
is the enemy of security

455
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
complexity is the enemy of security

456
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
it's pretty obvious the more code we

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
have in our systems the more protocols

458
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,520
the more we have room for bugs and when

459
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
we have bugs in connected systems they

460
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,880
become vulnerabilities

461
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,760
and if

462
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
this is true and it's true

463
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
then the solution should be really

464
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,760
obvious

465
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
which is that we should be reducing

466
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,520
complexity which means

467
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
every new version of every new app

468
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
and application and operating system

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
should be smaller and have less features

470
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
less code

471
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
and you know that that's not happening

472
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,679
every new version of everything has more

473
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
code more features more stuff nothing

474
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
is becoming simpler

475
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
i had a really eye-opening discussion

476
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,559
with david weston from microsoft and he

477
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
gave me this

478
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
startling figure that windows the

479
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
operating system is built from an

480
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
internal github instance that microsoft

481
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,160
runs which has 5.7 million source files

482
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,679
not lines files 5.7 million

483
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
files of code to build

484
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
windows

485
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
i wonder if any of those files have any

486
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
bugs

487
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,000
so when when we add complexity

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
we are building systems which are

489
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
becoming harder and harder to secure

490
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
and that's what the attackers are

491
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
looking for and if we want to secure our

492
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,559
systems we have to understand who we are

493
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,919
fighting

494
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,320
today it's fairly easy to define it's

495
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
organized crime gangs

496
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,120
and then it's nation-states which do

497
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,799
espionage and sabotage even wage war

498
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,280
online

499
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
organized crime gangs target

500
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
everyone

501
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
governments target

502
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,400
specific

503
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
targets

504
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
and around five years ago

505
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
i coined a new term

506
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,880
around the biggest and the most powerful

507
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,280
cyber crime gangs i started speaking

508
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,159
about cyber crime unicorns

509
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
unicorn here

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
being

511
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,240
is a reference to unicorn companies

512
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
privately owned technology companies

513
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
which are valued at over a billion us

514
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
dollars is typical definition of unicorn

515
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
company and i started wondering if we

516
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
one day

517
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
would see cyber crime gangs which are so

518
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,280
wealthy

519
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
that we should be considering them to be

520
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,120
unicorns

521
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
five years ago this wasn't obvious

522
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
today unfortunately the age of cyber

523
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
crime unicorn is here

524
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
cybercrime unicorns exist they are real

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
most of them are russian organized cyber

526
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,440
crime gangs making most of their money

527
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,520
with ransomware but we also have

528
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,799
unicorns

529
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,679
especially in things like bec

530
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,159
business email compromise also known as

531
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
ceo scams

532
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,799
so the wealthiest

533
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,600
organized cyber crime gang

534
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,080
like they would be companies

535
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
they have offices they pay monthly

536
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
salaries they have hundreds of people on

537
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,679
their payroll

538
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
higher lawyers they hire business

539
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
analysts they have hr teams

540
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
just like real world traditional

541
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
organized crime gangs like mafias and

542
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,840
triads and courses

543
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,400
so where else

544
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
are they spending their money

545
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,600
well let me show this to you

546
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
this is a website for one of our

547
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
competitors a company specializing in

548
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
penetration testing

549
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
what makes them or sets them apart

550
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,679
is that they pay three times higher

551
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,799
salaries

552
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,960
than the industry average

553
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
they hire pen testers for fully remote

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,840
at really competitive salaries

555
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
what's the trick

556
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,080
well the trick is that this is not a

557
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
company this is a crime gang operating

558
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
from russia

559
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,480
they've set up fake front-end companies

560
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
to make them look like

561
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
a trustworthy security company so they

562
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,120
can hire security professionals to work

563
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
for them

564
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
they hire these people

565
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
enroll them into the company

566
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
then

567
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
point them at a client here's a client

568
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
who has ordered a pen test please scan

569
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
their network break in and write a

570
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
report about the vulnerabilities please

571
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
leave the report once you're ready go

572
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
and then these pen testers break into

573
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,080
companies which have not ordered pen

574
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
tests at all and they end up working

575
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
for the enemy

576
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
they end up working for the enemy

577
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,760
this is the kind of tricks

578
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,240
crime gangs can start doing when the

579
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
money is no longer

580
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,280
an object

581
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
so is the situation getting worse

582
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
well actually

583
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,000
no

584
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,039
i think it's getting better

585
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,280
mikko what do you mean

586
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,039
i think we're leaving

587
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
right now a time where security is

588
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
better than ever and i know it doesn't

589
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
look like that

590
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
but i'm confident that is the situation

591
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
you look at the security of the

592
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
computers we run today or the

593
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
mobile phones we have today you look at

594
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,320
what we had 10 years ago it's like night

595
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,279
and day

596
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,760
we have been a improved the built-in

597
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,279
security of our devices and the

598
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
operating systems and the apps

599
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
one of the biggest revolutions

600
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
has been what i call

601
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,919
security by playstation and i know it's

602
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
an xbox but excuse me

603
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,320
interestingly xbox runs the most secure

604
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
version of windows ever released by

605
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,039
microsoft because xbox runs windows but

606
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,760
it's a very limited very secure version

607
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
of windows

608
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
which is kind of weird like the biggest

609
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
software company on the planet puts

610
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,200
their most secure operating system in a

611
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
games console isn't that a bit weird but

612
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
that is the situation

613
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,120
the end result is that you never hear

614
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,799
about malware

615
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,240
on xboxes or on playstations or hacks or

616
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,360
things like that it's just not a thing

617
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
why is that relevant

618
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
because these

619
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
are playstations it's exactly the same

620
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
model restrictive environments

621
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
which are not real computers they look

622
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,880
like computers they have processors and

623
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
things like that but you're not allowed

624
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
to program them

625
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,720
but as an end result they are much more

626
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
secure

627
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
so how can i say that mobile phones are

628
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,919
secure when we've just seen the

629
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,520
headlines through this

630
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,919
last year about things like pegasus

631
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,039
being used to hack iphones and android

632
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,480
devices

633
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,919
well

634
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
this

635
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,760
is a success story

636
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
this is not a failure

637
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,240
this is a success story

638
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
because the price of pegasus

639
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,960
per victim is hundred thousand euros

640
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
pegasus is used by governments to spy on

641
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
people they're interested in they buy

642
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,559
the product from a company which only

643
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,520
sells to governments and the rough price

644
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,240
per head is 100 000 euros someone's paid

645
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,640
100 000 euros for the right to hack the

646
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,320
iphone belonging to spanish prime

647
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,279
minister

648
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
that's a success if you have to spend

649
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
100 000 euros to hack a phone

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,799
that's a pretty high bar that means

651
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,279
that most of us are safe most of us will

652
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,760
never be targeted by someone

653
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,200
who would have to spend a hundred

654
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
thousand euros to hack our phones you

655
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,679
have to be someone special to be

656
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,200
targeted by this

657
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
security by playstation works

658
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
it does work

659
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
this is a success story that's what it

660
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,279
is

661
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,640
so

662
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
i used to call myself

663
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,120
computer security researcher or computer

664
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
security expert because that's what i

665
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
thought i was doing

666
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,159
i secure computers

667
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
well i don't secure computers anymore

668
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
neither do you

669
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
the whole society around us runs on

670
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
computers

671
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,440
we me and you we we are not securing

672
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
computers we are securing the whole

673
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,640
society

674
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,000
and when we do this

675
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,120
the successes in our business

676
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,039
are invisible

677
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
for years i've been speaking about cyber

678
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
security tetris

679
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
because in the game of tetris your

680
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,919
successes disappear when you make a

681
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,520
whole line

682
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,799
it disappears

683
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
your successes disappear but your

684
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
failures pile up

685
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
that's what we see in cyber security as

686
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
well when we succeed

687
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,440
it only means

688
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
that nothing happens

689
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
when we succeed it only means that

690
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
nothing happens and the fact that

691
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,919
nothing happened we'll never make the

692
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
headlines

693
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,840
when we fail

694
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
everybody sees that

695
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
when we fail in securing our systems

696
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
when we fail in securing

697
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
our employer systems or our client

698
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
system that's when we see the headlines

699
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,080
of yet another data leak yet another

700
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,360
data breach

701
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
yet another malware outbreak failures

702
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,360
are very visible successes are invisible

703
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
that's

704
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,720
what i mean by cyber security tetris

705
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
and i hear the stories

706
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,320
the success stories regularly

707
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
stories of

708
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
the i.t team which worked through the

709
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
night to patch all the servers against

710
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,279
the new vulnerability and they were able

711
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
to finish patching

712
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,440
early in the morning just an hour before

713
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
their network was scanned by an outsider

714
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,799
who was looking for the vulnerability

715
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
they save the company

716
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,679
but no one knows

717
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,760
no one will ever know successes

718
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,320
are invisible and rarely

719
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,720
is anyone thanked for stopping a

720
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,679
disaster which didn't happen

721
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,679
rarely is anyone thanked

722
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,360
for stopping a disaster that didn't

723
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,600
happen

724
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
thank you

725
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,560
thank you very much

726
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,790
[Applause]

727
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,940
[Music]

728
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
you
