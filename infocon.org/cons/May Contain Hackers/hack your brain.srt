[Music]

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
starting is the difficult part

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
uh we are talking about hacking your

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
brain and many messages will appear

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
between the lines so

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
be careful to

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
try to figure out what we want to say

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
so the talk started

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
starts a long time ago

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
in the year 1993 nobody

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,440
took care at least to my knowledge about

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,239
food you can see on the picture alcohol

13
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,600
the cider bottle in the tent you see the

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,879
meat

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,000
the salami you also see coffee and you

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
see diver products so this was 1993

17
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,440
nobody cared about this

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
then 4 4 years later

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
you also see the salami on the picture

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
and

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,280
i

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,840
think nobody didn't care either at this

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,640
time

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,240
and so me i drank lots of ico we had big

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,159
parties at those events

26
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,280
and

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
it was a great time the cia said well

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,479
the potentially one thousand most

29
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,040
dangerous people worldwide and maybe it

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
was i don't know

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
so

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
that's the introduction

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,200
then

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,159
i getting older i'm getting ill i get

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
brain fog which means

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880
the short time memory was reduced so

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
working on the computer getting hard

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
read the documentation and try to

39
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,360
produce something useful

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
was difficult for me so at that time i

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
missed um

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
so that's the reason

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,159
for that

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
then later on

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
i getting really fat so i had

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
maybe 120 kilos i think

47
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
so but i didn't know the reason for all

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
this stuff at that time

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
then

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,959
i

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
found a website

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
urinale.org

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
where you can check your urine

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,360
for pesticides and i

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,200
attended to that test

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
and paid a few bucks for testing my wien

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,720
and the result was i had 20 times more

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
clefusart in my own then is load in the

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
drinking water in germany 20 times

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
so that was amazing and i

61
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
had no clue where it comes from and

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
took me several years to find out what

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
is going on

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
so the last thing which really started

65
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,879
all my

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,239
investigation

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,599
was gout i was barely able to climb the

68
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,680
stairs and i thought i must go to the

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
hospital and get new knees inside my

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
body

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
for

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
for

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
getting walk could

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
so i could walk again

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,280
but

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
the solution was very simple

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,080
it was very simple at one time

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,599
in holiday

79
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
i stopped eating meat

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
and after two weeks of holiday i

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
recognized that my

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,239
problems with my knees

83
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,440
get somehow better but very very slow

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
and then i extended the period to four

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,480
weeks then i extended in to

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
three months and then i extended the

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
period without eating meat to half a

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,400
year

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
and after half a year i had didn't have

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
any problems

91
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
nothing and i could reproduce it

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
when i'm going to my sports club on

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
friday evenings i drink

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,560
wheat beer and also

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
eating sausages and the day after on

96
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
saturday i had problems with my niece

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
and that that was for me the booth

98
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,880
so how do we go with the uh

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
do not know the word we just go on so we

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
our goal is healing at first

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
then we we tell you something what we

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
did

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
been there done that and

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,280
additionally we got this and this is why

105
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,240
we i want to talk to you on this you

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
want to say something

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
yes there's a

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
you may know hippocrates

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,320
he said let your remedies be your food

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
and your food be your remedies

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,320
and i think that's a

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,520
very important sentence because

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
we actually put something in our mouth

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
we don't know

115
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
so

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
we we didn't make up our minds yet

117
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
so we

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
for me that was a

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
um

120
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,710
was really um

121
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,560
[Music]

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
initializing

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
because

124
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,360
when i started thinking about

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
food what do i put into my mouth

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
that

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
my mind became more clear i also

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
suffered on brain fog

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
which is really not nice

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
it took me for

131
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
about four hours in the morning to

132
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
wake up

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,639
just

134
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,840
just in the

135
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
in my head yeah

136
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
it's it's like every morning

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,720
you wake up like uh hello

138
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
somebody here

139
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,280
yeah

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,240
physically i'm here but that's it

141
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
yeah and

142
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,800
and then

143
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
i started

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
healing

145
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
only with

146
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
changing my food

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
habits

148
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
so i have an example prepared so this

149
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
are actually all my examples so i have

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
to talk maybe uncle will take over one

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,080
or two

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
so

153
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
the overfight was really amazing

154
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,880
because uncle showed up with a cleansing

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
cool which will be discussed later so

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,680
it's mainly you eat raw food

157
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,720
and we did it for

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
uh i think three months we did do our

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
cleansing cool

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,039
and what it is i will explain later

161
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,240
and

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
i lost

163
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,479
at

164
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,000
amount six

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
plus kilos per month

166
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,520
and it was not difficult at all the

167
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
difficult part was the time management

168
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
to prepare all the vegetables but i have

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
a nice picture for that also later so

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
that was

171
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
which is a big part of our talk but we

172
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
want to explain to you the next one was

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
the gout i already explained i stopped

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
eating pork meat and

175
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,719
it goes away

176
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,759
from time to time

177
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
then the next is the brain fog that is

178
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
really amazing man i talked about the

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
pesticides in my body and this

180
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,919
at some time i changed all my my

181
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
diary to organic food

182
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
so i hoped it gets less

183
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
the pesticides in my body get less

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
but that's not so easy

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
so i could actually i could reduce my

186
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,360
pesticides in the body by 60

187
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
and

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
a main

189
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
point which i want to point out in this

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
talk is time so time is on your side but

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
you

192
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
must take your time and it's

193
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
there are different times so if you use

194
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
drugs they maybe

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,240
uh hit you in a few seconds so if you

196
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,880
take alcohol it maybe takes half an hour

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,519
something like this or the medicine

198
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,039
maybe one hour

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,360
and so there are different timetables

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,480
how long it takes to enter your body and

201
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
the override took me three months it

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,959
wasn't cleansing cool though i lost 20

203
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
kilograms the

204
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
goat uh needed six months

205
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
the brain fog needed one and a half year

206
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,680
but anka has a method uh

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
uh how you can reduce this time and the

208
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
pesticides in my body is an ongoing

209
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
project i measured since six years and

210
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
i'm

211
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,399
60 percent off right now

212
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
so what's next

213
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,120
i think it's explains for itself

214
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
the lights are on

215
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
but nowhere is home

216
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,519
i found this

217
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
slide in our company hanging around and

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
make a picture of it so

219
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,839
we want to explain the cleansing

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
what you should do and what you should

221
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
not do

222
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,680
okay

223
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,240
then obvious first the obvious part do

224
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
not drink alcohol or at least reduce

225
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
your echo consume

226
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,080
smoking mind also not good

227
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
all the kind of drugs may be not so fine

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
so then we have the not obvious parts

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
this is what you can't see can't smell

230
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
the pesticides in every

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
part of our life i want to say there are

232
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,079
many many

233
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,760
tests who

234
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
measure pesticides in the air and the

235
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
recent one is in germany from the umwelt

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
institute mentioned i

237
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,160
couldn't

238
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
talk about all those scientific stuff

239
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
but you could

240
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
ask me

241
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
later and i can point you where you can

242
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,399
find the information

243
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,959
so and another point is the undeclared

244
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,040
additives so um

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
in every process of processing food

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
there will be put stuff inside for some

247
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
reason and

248
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,839
if it is not

249
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
in there after the processing you do not

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
have to declare it but

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
there is something left so for example

252
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,839
in the beer

253
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
there is micro

254
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
which is used for filtering and there

255
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
are an awful lot of examples for bread

256
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
bakery for everything for

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
also the sugars and stuff so be careful

258
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
with possessed food

259
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
then other and the

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
my environmental toxins

261
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,680
which is the of course if you're burning

262
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,279
uh petrol

263
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,079
or the fine dust and

264
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,040
also the co2 i mentioned the co2 because

265
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
if you walk uh work in a very small room

266
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
for a long time on a computer and do not

267
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
open the window the co2 level rises and

268
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
you

269
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,920
uh

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
yeah you get foggy you get sleepy and so

271
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
open the window while working a long

272
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
time in a small room also it's good to

273
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
take a break

274
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
at the certain amount of time i usually

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,760
take a break once an hour

276
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
that is really helpful if you must work

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,279
concentrated

278
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,279
maybe i give over to you yeah

279
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
yeah so um

280
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
what's to do

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
there are some

282
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
unsuitable foods

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
i call them actually no foods because i

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
don't eat them most of them

285
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,959
not anymore

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
so eggs

287
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,079
for examples i know

288
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
you probably all love eggs like

289
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
i did in the past

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
but eggs they feed viruses

291
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,079
so

292
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,279
that's why i thought by myself i'm okay

293
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
i don't want to get some viruses

294
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,320
not that much in my body so um

295
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
i

296
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,279
i just leave them

297
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
uh but viruses they causes a silent

298
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
inflammation

299
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
as well

300
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
so

301
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
you

302
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
people may get

303
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
ill and

304
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
don't recognize it

305
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
you know just it's just sometimes it's

306
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,880
just

307
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,320
slightly yes so you

308
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,810

really or

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,959
so that's the point you you you don't

312
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,680
you don't notice it maybe

313
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
which i didn't

314
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,790

it's

so like normal because everybody or or

319
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,639
many people around me they

320
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,000
yeah they take time to wake up

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
that's

322
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,959
that's a problem

it oh

329
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
soft drinks such as

330
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
cola iced tea

331
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,760
and

332
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
all that sweet sugar stuff

333
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
i know you may like it but it's there's

334
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,399
only

335
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
one natural beverage and that called

water

337
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,839
and you can make it taste if it put some

338
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,880
fruits in it and that's fine

339
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,519
these are really natural flavors

340

five or six different kind of sugars and

349
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
how they affect your body and the short

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
message is

351
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
sugar is transformed to fat and you get

352
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
fat and also as a poison for the liver

353
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
you can read it articles maybe three or

354
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,279
four years old i think

355
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
the point isn't really the sugar by

356
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
itself it's uh the the processed sugar

357
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
and uh that uh that's like a poison to

358
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,160
our body so so that's fructose sugar

359
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
and that is why

360
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,270
when you it's every time the sugar is um

361

[Music]

362
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,320
it's

363
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
isolated

364
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
yeah then then that becomes actually

365
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
like poison

366
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
yeah then

367
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
meat and fish

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
meat is unfortunately or fish

369
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
the animals

370
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
aren't free

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,680
was a word i was missing yeah

381
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,800
and

382
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,279
then the genetic modified vegetables

383
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
such as corn and soy

384
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,639
yeah that uh it also

385
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,040
modifies our genetic

386
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,560
so there has an impact

387
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,040
yeah

388
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,480
so industrial produced oil

389
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
it's just because

390
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
they produce

391
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,800
a huge amount of oil and that all gets

392
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,959
heat heat hidden up

393
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
and and that makes

394
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,359
the oil

395
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,639
it makes it bad

396
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,440
yeah

397
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
so the the ingredients of the oil

398
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,759
are modified somehow by the heat so if

399
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,400
you

400
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,359
can get your oil from a very small oil

401
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,559
mill

402
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,919
which has small machines this might be

403
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,240
much better than the industrial produced

404
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,199
oil so the reason is the heat

405
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,319
while processing the nuts or the seeds

406
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
so also i would mention

407
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
for all of this the wonderful talk from

408
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,000
the guy over there yesterday i think it

409
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,039
was

410
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,520
which goes in detail for the

411
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
bacteria in the in the

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
how it's called

413
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,679
um

425
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,280
in the morning

426
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,960
after i wake up i drink some lemon juice

427
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
sorry lemon water

428
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,160
so

429
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
i

430
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
do the fresh juice

431
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
a half lemon

432
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,000
for a half liter of water

433
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
yeah

434
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,720

435
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,080
um the lemon also helps to

436
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440

do like a cure

449
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520

450
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
three weeks four

451
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,600

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,320
so

526
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,520
there's no processed food in especially

527
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
not

528
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,600
from tins and and cans or

529
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,159
uh

530
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,440
like that yeah you you normally store

531
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,799
yeah or cooked in with sugar

532
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,679
no no no fruits

533
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,559
you only need fresh fruits and fresh

534
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
vegetables and you you can cook it it's

535
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,000
not that problem

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
but just do it by yourself

537
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,559
we are so

538
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,559
going out to to restaurants that's i'm

539
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,880
always a little bit

540
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
i'm a bit careful that

541
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
because i never know what is in there

542
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
and

543
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
especially the herbs

544
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
and the spices

545
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,679
um

546
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
this

547
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,640
often it's a it's a mix of

548
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
nobody knows what it is

549
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,840
so

550
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,039
i rather leave that

551
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
for a while maybe

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
yeah

553
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,960
i

554
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,679
we prepared a few receipts for you these

555
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,840
are quite

556
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,879
easy i will show you

557
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,960
so this is a fruit salad so it's really

558
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
easy just take fruits

559
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
and a few leaves

560
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,840
so there's a

561
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
lemon bulb in it and nettle

562
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
which is both good for your brain

563
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,080
so and just cut fruits put them together

564
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,559
you do not need any other ingredients

565
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
so then of course the hakka salad

566
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
dressing

567
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,039
which is

568
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,919
very easy take a cup of apple juice and

569
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,640
put some lemon juice in and a

570
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
small amount of oil

571
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,559
that's

572
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,279
that's it to any receipt you can add

573
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
salt and pepper

574
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,080
in an amount you like

575
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,279
but you will recognize the longer you

576
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,520
eat on raw food the less salt and the

577
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,720
less oil you will use so your taste

578
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
changes

579
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,159
so one of my favorites is the second

580
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,240
salad dressing

581
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,799
because you need the oil for your brain

582
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,960
especially the very good oil

583
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
oil from the

584
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
walnut or from

585
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
hemp or from

586
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
cashew

587
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,120
this is very good oil for your brain so

588
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
eat lots of this but not too much so

589
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,760
um preparing a salad dressing without

590
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
oil this is my favorite take the nuts

591
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
put them two hours in the water

592
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,880
put all the ingredients in the mixer and

593
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
press a button for a few seconds and

594
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
you're gone and this is perfect it's

595
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,679
really really delicious

596
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
then another

597
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,880
favorite of mine is the

598
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
raw food rice the cauliflower

599
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
as well as the poccoli is very good for

600
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,279
your brain both and you could

601
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,440
actually eat the cauliflower raw it's

602
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
unbelievable but it is

603
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,320
the juice just take the cauliflower take

604
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,360
the with water-soaked cashews

605
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
and

606
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
die with a spoon of soy sauce put it to

607
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
the mixer press a button for a second or

608
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
two and you are done and it's really

609
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
really amazing just try this one it's

610
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,240
unbelievable and your favorite is

611
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,559
sweet potatoes yeah that's actually

612
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
really simple

613
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
an avocado

614
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,200
um

615
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,559
an uncut an onion and

616
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,919
mash it and cut some slice of sweet

617
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,120
potato

618
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,480
and just dip the sweet potato

619
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,240
but

620
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,440
i like this recipe

621
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,320
so now we might finish our talk with all

622
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
that

623
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
what is going between the lines

624
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,799
so

625
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,919
if you

626
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
try it out with the raw food my problem

627
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,520
was

628
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
i have no time for preparing all the

629
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,120
stuff

630
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,400
and i

631
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
want to show you how you how i solved

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
this

633
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
so

634
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,400
if you work on a computer lots

635
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
you sometimes have boring meetings take

636
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,039
a knife take your fruits cut them and

637
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,640
you are gone so you need no extra time

638
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,520
that's the solution

639
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,840
so easy isn't it

640
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
actually this is my home working space

641
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
in the camber for the corona

642
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
panda me

643
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
so now our last slide but

644
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,240
we have to say a lot about this because

645
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
when i started the the

646
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,559
raw food cleansing cool

647
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,600
i'm not used to eat food like this i

648
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,159
was hungry all the time but i could eat

649
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,840
all the time that was an amazing thing

650
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
so i had up to seven meals

651
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,600
in the early stage of the raw food

652
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,720
cleansing i was literally eating

653
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
all the time

654
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and the good thing about that is i had

655
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
no cravings in the evening anybody here

656
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
with chocolate in the evening or chips

657
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,720
nobody's oh i'm in the first one

658
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
no no no

659
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,960
so there's no cravings in the evening

660
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
it's really fantastic you can't can't

661
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
believe it then

662
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,240
i actually mentioned and on my body

663
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,559
different types of incarnation while

664
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,480
eating raw food though

665
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,240
my my taste changes and i had of course

666
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,039
i had setbacks and eat meat in between

667
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,679
but these are like subsiding waves at

668
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
the start

669
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
it was often and later on it was

670
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
less so

671
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
that's it's uh also hacking your brain

672
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,720
your brain get used to it and you know

673
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,600
it

674
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
is a new normality if you do it for a

675
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,120
while

676
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
then uh the really fine stuff about this

677
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
diary is

678
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,679
there's no self-enforcement at any time

679
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,600
you could eat

680
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
what you want

681
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,679
unless it's not

682
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,880
raw

683
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,080
no

684
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
other way out

685
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,240
so if it is raw and

686
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,399
if you maybe say you tried for one day

687
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,360
or for two days and you you continue

688
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,520
voluntarily

689
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
and uh

690
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
do you want to take this point

691
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
different place of situation

692
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,320
so you all may recognize if you have a

693
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,000
goose for christmas and it lies in your

694
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
stomach like a stone

695
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
and

696
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,600
that's exactly the feeling

697
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,279
when i eat meat right now i love meat i

698
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,279
eat from time to time maybe twice a

699
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,880
month i read cow or

700
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,679
what is this called seagull

701
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,840
never mind the butter i goat but i feel

702
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,720
it's lies in my stomach

703
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,799
like a stone and also

704
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,960
yeah that's not that that's not the case

705
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
if i use the fruits so so i like it

706
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,440
better

707
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
the next

708
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
the next is the change of taste

709
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,520
that was really amazing with the

710
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,799
celery

711
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
juice we make we prepare for ourselves

712
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
in the

713
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
start

714
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,720
the celery juice doesn't did not smell

715
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,200
it was how it is called bitter

716
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,480
it was bitter

717
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,039
but after a while it got sweet

718
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,440
so after two weeks of drinking celery

719
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
juice it's got sweet so my taste changes

720
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
we use less salt and stuff like this

721
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
this is what i want to tell you between

722
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
the lines so it's it's

723
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
everything is positive for your body

724
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,360
everything

725
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,720
then

726
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,760
you feel reborn you could like

727
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,960
so it's perfect so not like oh

728
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,840
so

729
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,399
that's really really good so the next

730
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,460
point is for sure use

731
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,120
[Laughter]

732
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
yeah the better skin

733
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,240
i i got some better skin and

734
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,279
that's that was

735
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
what really amazes me

736
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,720
when the first time before we start

737
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
maybe lars skin was like a leather

738
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
and now it feels like skin

739
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,240
so

740
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,919
so it's not that rough anymore so and

741
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,320
acne here by the way disappeared

742
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
just by eating

743
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,840
i mean

744
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,080
that's amazing

745
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
yeah

746
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
i can't believe that though we couldn't

747
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
both believe that that and that's the

748
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,799
reason why i'm here while we are here

749
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,080
and talk to you

750
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,200
then the positive effect which is the

751
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
title of our talk is what

752
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
are the effects on your brain

753
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,480
you know if you are healthy and

754
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
if you are

755
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,919
in perfect shape you are more stable you

756
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,760
are stress resistant

757
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
your brain capability improves your

758
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
mental stamina improves so i could work

759
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
the whole day if i take my breaks that's

760
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
that's important so

761
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,039
take your breaks every hour maybe five

762
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,039
minutes just stand up walk around go

763
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
back to work and you could work the

764
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,440
whole day with which is very important

765
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,919
sometimes on the computer so you do not

766
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,760
need the

767
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
the

768
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
club mata or coffee in the night

769
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,080
just if you're

770
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,159
sleepy go to bed and work the next day

771
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,320
so and you can really work long a long

772
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,519
time

773
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
then

774
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,640
also the

775
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
in the afternoon

776
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
you do not have this

777
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,279
afternoon gap from all the heavy meals

778
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,679
that's important and now we have an

779
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,760
paper with lots of add-ons because we

780
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,200
have a few time

781
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,000
few minutes left

782
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,840
i have a few points which are not on the

783
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,640
slides so the main the important

784
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
vitamins are ce b1 b6 and b12 and b12 is

785
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
a vitamin which could not be produced in

786
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
your body

787
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,559
i think it's absorbed in the

788
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,840
end part of the intestine intestinal

789
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,640
tract

790
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,960
but um

791
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
there's something missing so you can't

792
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,320
really uh

793
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
produce this by yourself you must

794
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,200
yeah you you need to be 12.

795
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,039
just eat

796
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,559
natural food for the b12

797
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,810
especially

798
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,159
[Music]

799
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,120
maybe you have an apple tree go outside

800
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
and pick the apple from the tree

801
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,679
and then there are these

802
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,840
microbes on the apple that

803
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,678
produces the b12

804
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,840
so also you have to

805
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
what is very good are sprouts for the

806
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
magnesium for the thing and for the

807
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,919
potassium which is also very good for

808
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,120
your brain

809
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
so the

810
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
for example wheat spots is very healthy

811
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,799
then for the brain you could simply

812
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,880
search on the search engine of your

813
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
preferences for brain food you will find

814
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
something

815
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
natural rice is actually very good and

816
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
nuts i told you already broccoli

817
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,280
uh nettle lemon balm and a few others

818
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
patreon is

819
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,320
also good and ginkgo and there are many

820
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
many different

821
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,239
vegetables which

822
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,639
also all fruits of course

823
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,199
so and that brings us to our end

824
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
we have something

825
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,440
and we thank for your audience thank you

um we have a couple of minutes left for

835
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
some questions and i see one person

836
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,800
standing up there too

837
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,119
so please uh state your question short

838
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,320
and stout

839
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
thanks for your very personal story

840
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
um

841
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
there's a lot of research backing

842
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,440
exactly the sort of things you've done

843
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
well almost exactly there are a few

844
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,400
different so if you don't mind me

845
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,320
mentioning them but

846
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
good places to turn for scientific

847
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
information about this would be

848
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,839
nutritionfacts.org

849
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,160
and physical commission committee for

850
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,520
responsible medicine pcrm.org and the

851
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,960
latter being more for

852
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,359
for simpler people and the first

853
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,440
nutrition facts more for nerdy

854
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,920
information about research papers are

855
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,720
excellent sources of information

856
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,280
they do warn much more about b12 than

857
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
you do

858
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
but they say don't mess around with it

859
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
you will get serious problems and you

860
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,640
will be too late recovering from that so

861
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,800
and the advice picking it from an apple

862
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,040
tree but is definitely disadvised by

863
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,599
them so i want to add that

864
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,880
um

865
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
the raw food is not so strongly

866
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
emphasized in the these but i haven't

867
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,839
seen really can you get to the question

868
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,920
oh um

869
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
sorry no i was i was commenting i was

870
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
just adding adding a few things that i

871
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,200
encountered thank you

872
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,560
[Music]

873
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,480
thank you go ahead um thanks for the

874
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
talk um i was wondering uh why is the

875
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
oil from the

876
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
the small oil mill better

877
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,079
that's the reason is the heat the the

878
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,119
the

879
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,760
machines for pressing the nuts or the

880
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,920
seeds do not

881
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,440
get so hot

882
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,599
and if oil gets hot some of the

883
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,480
ingredients get lost very important i do

884
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,320
not know the english word it's omega-3

885
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,480
and omega-6

886
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,079
amino

887
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,880
in german is aminos or i think they got

888
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,920
somehow

889
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
broken up or something like that and

890
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
that's the reason why you should use the

891
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,880
small almost or even better just take

892
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
the nuts or the seeds directly okay and

893
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,040
is organic meat allowed

894
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,079
of course

895
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,520
yeah organic

896
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,320
organic means nothing

897
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,720
no pesticides no yeah antibacter

898
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,040
there there's one thing about the meat

899
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,520
you can have meat that's not a problem

900
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
but if you

901
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
do

902
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,480
cleansing

903
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
then you should leave it

904
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,920
yeah

905
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,359
because uh that stops the cleansing

906
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,160
actually um

907
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,320
uh it's the fat and it's the um

908
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440
protein

909
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
that stops the protein stops the

910
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,359
cleansing i misunderstood the question

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,839
yeah yeah because because you mentioned

912
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,920
in your

913
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,079
intestine you have different kind of

914
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
bacteria and sometimes the one is more

915
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,680
sometimes the other is more and if you

916
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,920
make a raw food then it goes like this

917
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,480
and if you me it meat and goes like that

918
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
so it's not in balance anymore and you

919
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,800
need you need the good bacteria which

920
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
are good for your yeah

921
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
for your health thanks for eating

922
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,359
welcome

923
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,640
thank you

924
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,720
i think we still have time for let's say

925
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,240
one or two more short questions

926
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
yes

927
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,079
i've also one of my cards so if nobody

928
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,000
shows up i have another question

929
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,079
yeah thanks again for your talk um could

930
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,079
you say something about cheese so i love

931
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,240
cheese especially french made

932
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
thank you for that one

933
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,599
geez that's the same like meat so uh

934
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
you you shouldn't do it

935
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,240
um when you when you're really

936
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,480
sick uh just leave it for a while

937
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,119
yes i i really know i i i love to eat

938
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,920
cheese fries i love to eat cheese too i

939
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,880
i take the the organic cheese from the

940
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,040
small farms and

941
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,200
eat it sometimes like the meat once or

942
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,760
twice a month so i i like it very much i

943
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,440
can't get uh

944
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,000
can't stop eating this also but it's not

945
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,280
so good so that that goes for any milk

946
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,839
products or everything with with milk

947
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,920
yeah it's a diary product so if you have

948
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,400
for example the yogurt or something

949
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
there's often putting fructose glucose

950
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
syrup inside and that's really not good

951
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
for many reasons

952
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
okay thanks again for your insight so

953
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,640
that was great

954
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
you're welcome

955
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,640
uh okay

956
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
um

957
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,240
yeah sometimes uh you you mentioned

958
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
coriander yeah and um i was wondering

959
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,960
what your stones uh about

960
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,280
getting homeopathic

961
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,680
like when it's really concentrated yeah

962
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,320
to speed things up is is that possible

963
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,760
do you do that or

964
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,119
no it's about the fresh cilantro okay

965
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,200
and there are all the ingredients they

966
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,680
take the metals out of the brain but in

967
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,160
general about the whole story do you can

968
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,280
you speed things up by taking

969
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
ingredients that are really concentrated

970
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
because sometimes you hear the argument

971
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
that you can eat that food but there's

972
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,240
really a little

973
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,599
of that

974
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,240
ingredient in it

975
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,839
i think it depends on what it is okay

976
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,440
you you can

977
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
supplement

978
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,839
yeah that's okay that will speed it up

979
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,270
yeah but um

980
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,800
[Music]

981
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,040
i i have no experience with all the

982
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,440
other stuff so um

983
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
yeah yeah

984
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,400
but it's uh

985
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,680
actually all about the food so how do do

986
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,480
you

987
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,400
make it with food

988
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
because um

989
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,960
i ain't

990
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,560
experience i go out uh into uh into the

991
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,440
wood and uh yeah and packed my stuff and

992
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,359
okay what do i need uh homeopathic all

993
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,319
my bottles you know

994
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,560
just a hundred of bottles uh i don't

995
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,920
wanna take to the wood so a little

996
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,240
solution i just

997
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,800
just heal myself with food so that was

998
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,760
the

999
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
yeah the background

1000
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,440
yeah i mentioned it because sometimes

1001
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,760
when i go to a homeopathic store and

1002
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,880
they i say i eat a lot of um blueberries

1003
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,640
yeah and to you know to accomplish this

1004
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,480
and then they say oh there's a little

1005
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
there's so little in it you have to eat

1006
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,200
like three kilograms or of blueberries

1007
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,079
each day so take this of course they are

1008
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
biased because they want to sell it yeah

1009
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,400
do it do it for a long time and you need

1010
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
smaller amounts yeah that's what we

1011
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,760
recognize also um i'm not scientific at

1012
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,720
this point so many of the poisons go

1013
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,119
into the fat of your body so if you get

1014
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,119
rid of the fat you get rid of the poison

1015
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,040
in your body so that's exactly the

1016
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,160
amount

1017
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,280
i maybe lost 60 percent of my fat and so

1018
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,240
i lost 60 percent of my my point of the

1019
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,880
poison in my my body yeah so and so it's

1020
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,520
not not short-term short-term you can do

1021
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,960
if you

1022
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
maybe drink a tea i forgot something my

1023
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,720
absolute favorite it's a green hot tea

1024
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,760
it's just a tea you cook for 20 minutes

1025
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,000
it's very delicious and if you drink it

1026
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
you are all all day very relaxed and

1027
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,440
it's very healthy and so this is

1028
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,960
short-term

1029
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,599
food and long-term food for example the

1030
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,599
blueberries you eat for a longer time

1031
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,480
it's not

1032
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,640
not so if you take 10 kilos of

1033
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
blueberries in one week that you are

1034
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,800
yeah yeah okay

1035
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
