[Music]

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,600
people out here well you know me as

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
chris the

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,119
team lead music we'll be making music

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
all day my ears are still beeping a bit

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
for playing drums

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
uh but i stand in front of you as the

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
director of the dutch institute for

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
vulnerability disclosure with my team

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
so in reverse order you will be seeing

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
uh ashred osenberg

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
here at mca's cs officer at the bar

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
operations center

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
and also the chair of the cyber

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
operations center

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
but at the evds he's the chair of the of

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,559
the board

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,280
uh leonard austhorn uh here at mca is

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
juggling around with a whole lot of

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,239
zeros i don't know what it means but

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
it's very important and at the fvd he's

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
the head of c-cert which is not a

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
computer security incident responsible

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
for our own organization

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
but for the whole world

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
that's where we put our uh notifications

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
throughout the rest of the world and if

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
the dfd itself is in crisis we have

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
frank gradick our crisis manager but

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
here at mch he is the chief officer

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
bloonfolding

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
of course and he's also the super admin

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
of our hype intelligent telex

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
through which you can send

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
coded messages and he has been sending

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
musical requests to us on the stage

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
through his telex so thank you very much

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
for that

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
the fvd the dutch institute for

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
vulnerability disclosure we scan the

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
whole

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,520
ipv4 of the internet which is quite a

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
lot

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
and this is the second time we're here

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
because if you remember two days ago we

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
had the same talk

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,759
but in the middle of our talk

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,479
somebody pulled an internet cable

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,240
and then all the power of the whole plan

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680
went down

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
so we continued offline with all

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,719
nice q a but you folks at home you

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
missed the whole talk so this is take

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,199
two so we had a great rehearsal

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
uh but yeah we're two days later so

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
we're all bit worn out but we'll make

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,679
the best of it

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
the dutch institute of vulnerability

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
disclosure this is our mission we aim to

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
make the digital world safer by scanning

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
the whole internet reporting

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
vulnerabilities we find in digital

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
systems to the ones who can fix them

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
so those are mostly the owners of the

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
systems but sometimes also vendors or

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
their suppliers or their isps

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,200
put the notification forward you have

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
this old software running your

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
configuration is wrong please fix it

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
make it safer

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
that's what you know ethical hackers or

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
helpful hackers how you like to call

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
them normally do individually

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
to an individual system

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
we put this on steroids by doing it for

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
the whole internet with the whole

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
collective for the whole world

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
we have a global reach because we scan

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
your internet we notify but we do it

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
dutch style

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,920
which means it's very open we all use

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
our real names it's not really hacker

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
like we don't use pseudonyms

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
we also have an office you can even call

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
us which is not very typical for a

86
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
hacker collective

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
we do it collaborative so we work

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
together with many partners we don't

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
exclude others

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
we work with everybody just to make the

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,799
internet safer like well the red cross

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
also helps everybody

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,000
and above all we do it for free

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
we touch like free but it also has a

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
legal consequence why we do it for free

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
which brings us to well you know what

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
does it look like our daily practice

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,879
well a bit like this

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
we have our own autonomous system 5.059

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
so you can recognize us

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,080
put us on the allow list not on the

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
block list so we can scan you

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
through these ip series um while we also

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
use showdown but

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
from here we download the whole list of

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
ip addresses for the vulnerabilities we

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
scan on so typically there's a cv coming

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
out with a nice number and we know which

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
version so we just send the ping to the

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
whole world which version are you

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
running oh you have an old version from

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
the who is we look up your email

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
addresses and then we report to you your

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
our league

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
we also have a brand of research where

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
we do zero day research

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
so then it's not a known vulnerability

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,919
but already start scanning and warning

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,759
and trying to solve it with the vendor

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
and once there's a patch again we warn

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
the whole world

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
um if you just ask for the the the

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
version of a software well

124
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,080
there's no rocket science and that's

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
also legal but sometimes we need to use

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
well

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
sort of non-weaponized exploits to scan

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
your system

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
and

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
that's probably where things might

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,120
become a bit taggy

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
are you allowed to scan the old internet

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
well nobody asked you to do so nobody

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,919
allowed you to do it

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
in the strict sense it's illegal

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
we kind of violate

137
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
all sorts of computer fraud laws we also

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
kind of violate the gdpr because of

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
those lists with ip addresses and email

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
addresses those people never asked us to

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
use them

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,479
and moreover we also hand them to others

143
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,199
so why do we get away with it

144
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
check our code of conduct

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
it's on the website it's two pages but

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
these are the three most important

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
principles which are not just something

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
we made up

149
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,600
but something which comes out of case

150
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
law in the netherlands but also

151
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,039
international

152
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,320
because

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
you can commit

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
a kind of computer fraud slightly

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
if you do it for a societal need

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
so you're not being paid for it or you

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
do it out of revenge or to prove

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
yourself now you just do it to help

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
there's no financial incentive

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
and you see that well there's this huge

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,039
need because if we don't

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,039
these people remain vulnerable

163
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,000
and then

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the computer

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
criminals get in there and it's even

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
worse

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
and also we

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
kind of violate your privacy slightly

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,479
in order to prevent a much larger

170
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,199
privacy invasion so therefore a society

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
to need is in several court cases the

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
first thing our judge looks at you know

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,840
did you do it just to help people

174
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,319
yes but if that that is established

175
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,840
the judges look further because you

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
can't just hack anything saying oh it

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
was for the good cause so yeah i broke

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
it down blah blah blah and yeah that

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
their system is not running anymore

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
what's their fault because it was broken

181
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
anyhow no you can't do that

182
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,199
there comes in the principle of

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
proportionality

184
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
so the means you use in order to achieve

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
this goal is it in proportion to what

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
you're trying to achieve

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
so again you can well for example try uh

188
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
to reset an account on admin or info uh

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
just to see whether the procedures are

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,919
right

191
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
but if you start to reset a hundred

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
thousand accounts and the system goes

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
down well you proved it's not really

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,440
safe but it's a too harsh a measure also

195
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
if we cannot just scan for a version but

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,400
we need to use non-weaponized exploits

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
as if you know you're hacking them the

198
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
exploits shouldn't ruin the system

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
you're there to make it safer not

200
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
unsafer so if you have established that

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
you have a sort of proof of concept that

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
you can scan for good and it is

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
proportional to what you're trying to

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,759
achieve you reverse the process and

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
that's the principle of subsidiarity

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
okay this is what we want to achieve

207
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,599
this is the means we found for it this

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,919
is the scanning method but can we also

209
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
use another method which is less

210
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,039
invasive

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,840
so for example you can enter a database

212
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
you can look around of course see what's

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
in there establish well it's the true

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
database it's actual it's running but

215
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,639
please just make a screenshot of of the

216
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
folders and go don't start downloading

217
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
all this data because you don't need it

218
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,440
it's not proportional and there are less

219
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
severe means to use it subsidiarity

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
so so much for the legal ethical stuff

221
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
the boring stuff

222
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
now we go to the part where you came

223
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
from the case studies

224
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
the kind of researchers we did so we

225
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,560
take you back in time a year

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
remember this the second of july

227
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
the biggest ransomware attack ever took

228
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,399
place in the world on cassaya fayazan

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
these criminals thought they could well

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
hack about a million organizations with

231
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
the ransomware but what they didn't know

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,000
then was that dfd was already two months

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
on the case

234
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
and as this is a crisis i will now hand

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
it over to our crisis manager frank

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
thank you

237
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
there you go there you go

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
yeah cassaya

239
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,760
um

240
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
as mikos um yeah it was one of the

241
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,200
biggest cases we've we've ran

242
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
up until now

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,959
well that was my line before i started

244
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,880
talking about solarman

245
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,080
um

246
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
but it's actually a case that started

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
off with vitsa on our right who's here

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
in a picture with uh with victor who

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
unfortunately couldn't be with us due to

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
some health issues victor love you would

251
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
like to have you here but

252
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
yeah get well

253
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,040
um casey affairs case 2021 0 0 11.

254
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
yeah and how did it begin well

255
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
victor bones he's sitting over there

256
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
he's a penetration tester by day and the

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
ivd member my night as as jambos would

258
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,480
put it

259
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
and he was doing a pen test of a

260
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,839
customer and encountered a product

261
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
called cassaya fizzy

262
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
and as he was poking around on the

263
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
network trying to find a way in trying

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
to find a way to to get to his flags

265
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
um

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,920
he's like hmm this doesn't sit well with

267
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
me i think there's more to have but

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
i'm running out of time so

269
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,560
which being vc he took the software home

270
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
installed it in his lab and

271
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
started playing with it

272
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
and was it safe well

273
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
not really

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
initially we found around seven

275
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,040
cves

276
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,839
3116 a credentials leak and a business

277
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,360
logic flaw

278
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
credentials leak in the sense that you

279
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
could log on you could get to the system

280
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
say hey i want to install myself i want

281
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
to install my agent

282
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
you would get an installer file if you

283
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,399
installed the agent there was an ini

284
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
file and in any file there were

285
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,920
credentials to log in and those

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
credentials

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
were

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
credentials for an agent

289
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,680
but you could use them for much more

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
we also found an authenticated sql

291
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,839
injection vulnerability a way to write

292
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
into the database

293
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
i think it was a blind one so you

294
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
couldn't actually get data out you could

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
get data into the database

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
an unauthenticated remote code execution

297
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
vulnerability

298
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
several cross-site scripting

299
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
vulnerabilities i think we all lumped

300
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
them together

301
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
they thought it was smart to handle

302
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,680
two-factor authentication on the client

303
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
side

304
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
it isn't

305
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
then we found a local file inclusion

306
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
vulnerability in the agent well we

307
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
reached

308
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
and an xml and external entity attack

309
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
and that gave two theoretical attack

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
paths

311
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
one where you do the authentication

312
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,440
bypass then you use the sql injection

313
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
to actually write

314
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
jobs in cassaya because this is a system

315
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
administration tool so you could write

316
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
jobs to

317
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
to say you know what um

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
install a cryptominer and i vividly

319
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,720
remember

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
joking around saying

321
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
hmm or not really joking around i was

322
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,639
like like huh i wonder this could be big

323
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,079
you know this is many service providers

324
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
they have customers

325
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,760
usually managed service providers have

326
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
10

327
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,839
100 customers customers have 10

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,720
100 1 000 piece 1000 systems that are

329
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
ooh this could be a lot of systems

330
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,639
and then we said well if we do an

331
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
authentication bypass and then an sql

332
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
injection we can look into the database

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
and find out how many clients how many

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
systems this is

335
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
and then we said well if we do that we

336
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
might as well install a crypto miner on

337
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
all those things and it's like okay this

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,959
is where we stop something about ethics

339
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,040
and proportionality and subsidiarity all

340
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
the boring stuff that chris talked about

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,600
um later on we also found the remote

342
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
code execution that was unauthenticated

343
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
which was

344
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
yeah even even scarier i guess

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,480
yeah and with writing that job in the

346
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
database you could actually let those

347
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
clients do anything as soon as they

348
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,639
polled cassette festa they would do

349
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,839
whatever job you gave them

350
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
so what did we do well what do you do we

351
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
first of all we disclose to cassaya and

352
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
kasaya has been very cooperative with us

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
i think it was two days later or a day

354
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,480
later that we were in a call with the

355
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,079
cto

356
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
who was really scared that we were an

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
american party that would give them 30

358
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
days to fix everything and then

359
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,279
everything would be published

360
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,639
yeah i don't think that makes the

361
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
internet more safe

362
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,160
if you want to have that debate let's do

363
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
it outside with a beer

364
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
they had a strong focus on fixing it

365
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,800
they asked us several times to retest

366
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
findings once they once they fixed it

367
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
in the meantime we could build an nse

368
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
script a a nmap script to scan for

369
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
exposed cassette instances and we could

370
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,279
scan there because

371
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,120
there was an open api endpoint and that

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,240
open apn endpoint kindly sent back the

373
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
ip address it was running on which

374
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,880
virginia was running and a customer code

375
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,199
and that was a four digit customer code

376
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
or four letter customer code that

377
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
cassaya knew which customer it was and

378
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
that turned out to be quite handy

379
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
we found about 2200 casseya instances

380
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,279
remember each having about

381
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,160
100 times 110 000 systems connected to

382
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
it

383
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
maybe we never actually found out but it

384
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,600
was huge

385
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
and we didn't do a disclosure at that

386
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
point in time

387
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
because at that point in time if we

388
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,920
would have done a disclosure we were

389
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
afraid that this would lead to a very

390
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,720
significant ransomware campaign

391
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
so fast forwarding to the 2nd of july i

392
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
was sitting by the campfire with my

393
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,079
group of scouts

394
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
i'm a member of of scouts so i feel very

395
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,120
at home here among the hackers and the

396
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
scouts

397
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
and you know you're in trouble when you

398
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
walk away from the campfire

399
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
and you've missed

400
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,079
30 calls and got about 90 messages

401
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
um vitz had a similar experience he's

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,040
he's got a ping from uh from cassaya

403
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
it's like hey can you come online in a

404
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
meeting he opens up his

405
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,920
desktop

406
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,079
for some reason he had linkedin open i

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,360
don't think you're searching for a job

408
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
anymore

409
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
and there was like this news article

410
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,959
ransomware attack on casey okay

411
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,199


412
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,519
um so we started a crisis call

413
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,199
and then we remembered yeah but we have

414
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,920
a list of exposed 3sa instances now we

415
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
do need to verify it was about a month

416
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,519
old then

417
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
um we did send out notifications hey

418
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
you're likely running cassaya vsa it's a

419
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
good idea to do it uh to to not connect

420
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,279
it to the internet anymore

421
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
we provided a list of services to

422
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,399
cassaya

423
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,600
we helped them with the crisis

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
management we helped them with their

425
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
decision to take the system the sas

426
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
servers offline

427
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
we started a new scan with zed map and

428
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
that nmap and that nse script and we

429
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
rinsed and repeated

430
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
and then

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
our then ceso

432
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,880
was like

433
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000


434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
did they attack us did they get the

435
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
exploits from us

436
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
uh

437
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,399
well they did something differently it

438
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
turned out they are using the same

439
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
authentication bypass that we found but

440
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,440
they were using a different

441
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
vulnerability which was a file upload

442
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
phone or really arbitrary file upload

443
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,959
then call the file

444
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
which called for local file inclusion

445
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,120
file code execution

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
and then update the task list and

447
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
install ransomware everywhere and by the

448
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
way they do get went for money

449
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,360
um the other reason why we think they

450
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
never hacked us is well a thorough

451
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,279
investigation thank you

452
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
for that the other part was

453
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
we had this more nasty exploit here on

454
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,120
the top

455
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
we had a direct remote code execution

456
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
would have made this attack so much more

457
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
efficient from their perspective and so

458
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
much more hurtful for us

459
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
it worked

460
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
as in

461
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,319
the number of cassav instances in our

462
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
baseline scan one and two was about

463
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
2200.

464
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
overnight it dropped to about 600

465
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
then it dropped during the day

466
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
to about 50

467
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,880
and on the 4th of july

468
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
obviously on the 4th of july i remember

469
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
having calls with people who were on

470
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,760
boats

471
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,919
with barbecues in the background

472
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
um it even dropped lower

473
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
part of these things went offline

474
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
because they got encrypted

475
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
and and companies

476
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
were in panic mode

477
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
others went offline because we told them

478
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
so and i actually got the feedback like

479
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,360
yeah yeah this is the third time we've

480
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
been called to take it offline it was

481
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
just the system to see what happens

482
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
we're taking it offline and on the

483
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
fourth of july there were no cassaya psa

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,799
systems online in the netherlands at all

485
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,080
but it also didn't

486
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,679
because co-op supermarket in denmark had

487
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,799
to close down 500 stores

488
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,679
about 1500 organizations got their

489
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,960
entire businesses cryptid

490
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
were crippled

491
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
which reminds me of niko stwe miko's

492
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,760
tweet

493
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
uh from a while back rarely has every

494
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
anyone been thanked for the work they

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
did to prevent a disaster that didn't

496
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,640
happen

497
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,840
we were planning to do

498
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,200
that we failed that we got tanked

499
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
profusely

500
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,679
why wasn't the sas version affected

501
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,120
because there's also a sas version of

502
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
cassaya vsa well because it doesn't have

503
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
the authentication bypass they use a

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,600
different method

505
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
everything else worked but the

506
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,240
authentication bypass so if we would

507
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,160
have been hacked the disaster would have

508
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
been a lot bigger

509
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
so one of the things we got challenged

510
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
on is is the long

511
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,679
way to exposure why didn't we disclose

512
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,000
earlier

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
like i said we had better exploits than

514
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
refill

515
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,200
it would have worked on the sas version

516
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,799
too they would have made a bigger

517
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
disaster

518
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,679
but we did learn to be more firm

519
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,200
offenders

520
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,520
because if you wait too long

521
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
you'll be the next

522
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
if you get a call from us that there's a

523
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,200
problem with your product

524
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
it's kind of nice if you listen

525
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
it had a very satisfying ending in the

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
sense that the rifle ransomware gang was

527
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
arrested in russia

528
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
which is all the better

529
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,320
but yeah and it put us on the map

530
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,200
which

531
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,039
leads me to the second case learn it

532
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
yeah it works all right like you can see

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
on the screen um

534
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,679
sorry

535
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,720
yeah

536
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
i wanted to talk about two different

537
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
cases that were quite unique for us and

538
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
that's why i think they're interesting

539
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
to talk about

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
they're the global charities and our

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
global health care case

542
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
like chris told you earlier we're

543
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,080
usually scanning for known uh cves or

544
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
in the case of cassaya working with

545
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
vendors to disclose our own zero-day

546
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
research but these two are different the

547
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,840
cases we ran were 39 in 2021 and we've

548
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
already surpassed that number in 2022

549
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
so we're working really hard at that

550
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
and we're happily chugging along with

551
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
that and then this happened a cyber

552
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
attack on the red cross

553
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
where data of vulnerable people was in

554
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
danger

555
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
so the cyber attack happened because of

556
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
an unpatched server

557
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
and the server happened to be manage

558
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,120
engine from zoho and at that point we

559
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,240
were like

560
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
we know this name have we looked at this

561
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
did we not look at this why would wasn't

562
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
this prevented by us

563
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
so

564
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
we looked back and we were like hey we

565
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
did make a slack channel for this we

566
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
looked into it

567
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,559
but sadly it turned out that there was

568
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,080
no benign way to scan for this

569
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,159
vulnerability without

570
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
very high chance of harming the systems

571
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
so we couldn't scan for it and warned

572
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,000
the users

573
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,919
which made us quite sad because we

574
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,039
really wanted to help

575
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,440
um but in helping of course we have to

576
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
follow our code of conduct

577
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
we're not for hire we don't target

578
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
individual organizations so at this

579
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
moment we have to be a little hacky of

580
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
our own code of conduct and instead of

581
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
targeting a single organization we

582
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
wanted to help like the red cross we

583
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
decided to scan all the charities and

584
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
healthcare providers we could find

585
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,280
this resulted in two new cases

586
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,640
which you can see here our global

587
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
charity vulnerabilities and our global

588
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
healthcare vulnerabilities cases

589
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
and this was for us an entirely new

590
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
approach because usually we send an

591
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
email and then for a commercial party

592
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,760
hey you know now you are aware please

593
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
fix it's your responsibility

594
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
but we really cared about these ngos and

595
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,200
charities

596
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
and all the good work they are doing

597
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
so we really wanted to help them give

598
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,919
them a bit more aftercare really chase

599
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
down the fixes do the follow-up and for

600
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
a change we were not scanning for a

601
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
single vulnerability we were scanning

602
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,159
for all the things we could find that

603
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,039
would put these organizations at risk

604
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,840
so

605
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
we did it we managed to help them find a

606
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
lot of vulnerabilities get a lot of them

607
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,120
resolved receive nice thank you messages

608
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
and then you think we're done no we're

609
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
not done now

610
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
because what's next

611
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
we have these lists of ip spaces and

612
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
domains that we can now link to these

613
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
organizations whose work we find so

614
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,440
important so in any new case that we run

615
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
we can check our list of results

616
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,159
for these organizations and give them

617
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
the same aftercare that we did in these

618
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,919
two unique cases

619
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,280
and that's how we'll be

620
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
moving forward trying to help these

621
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
organizations that also do their best to

622
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
make the world a better place

623
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,280
because

624
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
we think it's really needed as we see

625
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
definitely see a pattern in these

626
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,200
organizations that they're so busy doing

627
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
the good work or in cases of charities

628
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
and ngos not always have the funds to do

629
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
cyber security well

630
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
and that's a pattern we're seeing

631
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,840
in various cases and one of these

632
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
different cases is the zimbra case which

633
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,039
frank will now tell you a bit more about

634
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
yeah zimbra

635
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,799
um

636
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
zimbra

637
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,640
was a different case it was one of those

638
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
cases where we

639
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
looked for something that was already

640
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
being exploded exploit

641
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,720
um

642
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,799
and with zimbra it was a cross-site

643
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,360
scripting that was used in operation

644
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
email thief

645
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
um the dear people at valekcity who do

646
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,440
some excellent work every now and then

647
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,000
actually identified a campaign

648
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
in which an attacker first sent a

649
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
reconnaissance mail

650
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,799
then a couple of days later send another

651
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
mail if the account was actually active

652
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,919
and if somebody clicked on the mail

653
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,720
while being logged into zimbra webmail

654
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
that link would successfully redirect to

655
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
a url

656
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,279
and all your email would go to their cnc

657
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,720
server

658
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,840
all of it

659
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,200
so zimbra is a product that's

660
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,600
like outlook or exchange it's a

661
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,279
groupware product

662
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,000
email client scheduling

663
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
those kind of things

664
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
and it had a lot of potential victims

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
well back on that first date the 14th of

666
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
december

667
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,320
there were roughly 65 000 timber servers

668
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,159
in the ipv4 first

669
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,480
ipv4 space

670
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
that were all vulnerable

671
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
and there were things like european

672
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
government bodies media universities

673
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,200
ukraine government and isps

674
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,480
russian government bodies

675
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,120
those kind of organizations are

676
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,240
important

677
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
data getting stolen from universities is

678
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,840
not a good thing

679
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,600
generally on the 7th of february the

680
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
number of vulnerable servers was reduced

681
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
to 31 000 because at that point in time

682
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
there was actually a patch some people

683
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
could patch

684
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,559
but this was still exploited in the wild

685
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,880
that number went down

686
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,640
on the 14th of february to about 24 000

687
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
and then it stabilized on the 14th of

688
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,520
march

689
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,799
but we're not really sure if it's

690
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
stabilized

691
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,919
because it turned out that there were

692
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,400
two ways to upgrade your zinpa server

693
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
one is

694
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
chuck it away get a new one install the

695
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
new software the other one was a hotfix

696
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,279
and that hotfix did fix the

697
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,279
vulnerability but didn't change the

698
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,720
version number

699
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
in the front end

700
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,360
so

701
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
we were doubtful if those numbers that

702
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,279
we were seeing were actually vulnerable

703
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,320
clients

704
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,559
so at that point in time we decided okay

705
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,080
we're not gonna

706
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
continue on the spot we did some

707
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
research we couldn't find any more

708
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
reliable way to do vert to do

709
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,679
fingerprinting

710
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,120
and that was

711
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
the end of this talk

712
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
with that

713
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,439
i'm going to give it over to uh

714
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
and um

715
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
while austin is coming here it's uh yeah

716
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
it's one of those cases where you end up

717
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,159
not on high

718
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,120
uh

719
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,600
but with a little bit of info area i was

720
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
just listening to your talk and are yeah

721
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
but it's really impressed so

722
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
i only have two hands and now i have

723
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
treating so

724
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
well hello everybody

725
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
i'm gonna tell you something really

726
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
exciting about governance who doesn't

727
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
want to know anything about governance

728
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,159

730
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,720

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
no i'm just kidding

732
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
it started

733
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,799

divd

747
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
we they call it a dutch institute for

748
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,960
vulnerability disclosure i call it

749
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,080
this is victor's drone this is victor's

750
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,960

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
gonna tell the story

757
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,840
because victor has started this whole

758
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,440
dream um

759
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
in its own way like

760
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,440
he took a sabbatical not in 2014 2015 or

761
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,480
2017 no

762
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,159
in 2016

763
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,720
because it was a leap year so there was

764
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,960
one more day 360 days and he could find

765
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
vulnerabilities he did he did a lot i

766
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,760
don't know the number but it's really

767
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
big

768
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,760
and this is how it all started

769
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,080
and then he wanted to make his dream

770
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,520
bigger and he asked chris and me to help

771
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,640
him and

772
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
well then frank came leonard came and

773
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,640
then hundreds

774
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,919
no i say hundreds but 100 volunteers

775
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,120
came and

776
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,039
this is how we

777
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
became this bunch of nice people

778
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
we have a supervisory board we have a

779
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
board we have a director we have a

780
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,080
management team

781
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,360
and 100 volunteers we are looking all

782
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
happy here so

783
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,000
um

784
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,880
well i think we are

785
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,600
so now you can see this beautiful

786
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
picture about how we thought about how

787
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,840
you make a good volunteer organization

788
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
what do you want to do you want to make

789
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,960
sure your volunteers are happy

790
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,080
so

791
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
we have a board we have a supervisory

792
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,120
board who tells us to oh take care of

793
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
this and don't do that and then we do it

794
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,840
anyways because we are a bunch of

795
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,120
hackers and we also have our director

796
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,600
chris who never done this before so

797
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,399
that's is why we wanted him we have a

798
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,159
research we have c cert we have

799
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,279
operations we have hrm communication

800
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,320
finance compliance it almost sounds like

801
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,559
a real company but still

802
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
it's built with people who never done

803
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
this before

804
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,000
and we are doing a awesome job

805
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
just saying

806
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,240
then the next step we decided to

807
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
start is the academy because we have a

808
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
lot of youngsters who want to become

809
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,440
a hacker

810
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
but well

811
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
sometimes you have to teach them how

812
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,200
to do it in an ethical way and this is

813
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,039
what we call the advanced kitten herding

814
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,919
which

815
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
we have a big dream with the divd

816
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
academy we also have a board there and

817
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,360
i have to say we are a real

818
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,240
own foundation since two days so i'm

819
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
very happy

820
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,559
to announce it finally worked barbie van

821
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,279
campen also known as fish

822
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,240
and victor havers also known as xerox

823
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,200
dude

824
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,279
and me are the founders

825
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,159
we have a hell of a board we have mugs

826
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
he's sitting somewhere there we have

827
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
charesh and we have bari as the the

828
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,559
chair

829
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,640
and our

830
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,559
what we really want to do is to teach

831
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,000
our youngers

832
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
youngsters because we

833
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,399
we are all getting old not me but other

834
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
people are getting old and we want to

835
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,720
learn them the stuff they

836
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,360
they have the skills they don't learn it

837
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,679
at school they want to make the world a

838
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
better place divd wants to make the

839
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,159
world a better place we need our

840
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,799
youngsters to start learning stuff like

841
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,760
this

842
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
so we are

843
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,159
thought well

844
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,399
we just gonna hack the school system

845
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,720
we're gonna build our own school that's

846
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,399
the difd academy i can tell for hours

847
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
about that but i'm not going to bore you

848
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,880
anymore if you want to

849
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,159
know more just ask me

850
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,120
this is a very important thing also

851
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
because we are

852
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,279
like crystals uh

853
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,640
the ifd we do it in a dutch way we're

854
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,440
focusing on dutch whatever

855
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,559
and then we found out we need our peers

856
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,360
around the world like in every country

857
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,559
we really need a divide who do the same

858
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,480
stuff so we started cert global with eva

859
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,559
every treehouse i'm not sure his talk

860
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,799
was already

861
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,720
tomorrow or tonight at 11 chris is gonna

862
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
tell you more about that this is really

863
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
important because

864
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,360
we need to grow grow grow to make the

865
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
internet a safer place for all of us for

866
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,399
our youngsters for myself i want to be

867
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,880
one day when i'm really old i'm still

868
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
very young i want to be

869
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,440
on the internet and your information

870
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
wants to be free i want to be free i

871
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,320
want to

872
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
talk to everybody i know in a safe way

873
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,080
and i think

874
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,000
we at the if the ivd we can handle that

875
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,090
is this the moment i give you the

876
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,200
[Music]

877
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,480
microphone

878
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,720
oh look at our tent

879
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,679
okay i'm gonna yes that will do it so

880
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,919
this was

881
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559
yeah so you can see us here across the

882
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,039
abacus this is our 10th

883
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,840
uh you probably saw the the lawn

884
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
yes

885
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
vitsa also hacked that one

886
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
uh well not only this device but the

887
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,200
online platform so he's now sending all

888
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
these lawnmowers here to mch if you see

889
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,799
him approaching at the gate again it is

890
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,080
a vitsa

891
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
you can come there if you want to join

892
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,039
the ivd as a researcher or a sea serter

893
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,559
and if you want to build up your own

894
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,600
chapter

895
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,640
uh in your country uh eva driers will be

896
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
uh giving a talk tonight at 11 o'clock

897
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,799
we already are setting up a chapter in

898
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,640
the us and the uk

899
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
and these chapters they actually

900
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,000
translate our findings to the local

901
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
context

902
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,039
so you can imagine that if we have a

903
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,120
list of ip addresses

904
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,760
on the us say we can send them emails

905
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,599
but they don't know what the ivd is and

906
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,119
they might think about fraud or you know

907
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,639
a bunch of criminals

908
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,879
if there's organizations in the u.s they

909
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
can also translate it to to their

910
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,159
constituencies on what this actually

911
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,040
means they can also interpret it um

912
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,760
researchers from the us can also work

913
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,719
with us through c cert global

914
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,639
so we can kick off a scan with their

915
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
methods etc

916
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
i'm really looking forward to a german

917
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,119
chapter so this is my cry out to uh all

918
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,679
the wonderful germans helping out on mch

919
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
i know vulnerability disclose is very

920
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,599
difficult in germany especially compared

921
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,000
to the netherlands what we need to and

922
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,639
this is also my colleague to the belgium

923
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,000
colleagues because vulnerability

924
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
disclosure in belgium is much easier but

925
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,280
we might need some translation french

926
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
something like that

927
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,560
and we're also working on sweden and

928
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
japan so hopefully

929
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,839
more countries will join

930
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,640
10 40 10 14 not 11. ah 10 40. very well

931
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
because then he's just finished before

932
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
uh symphony of fire is starting you know

933
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,040
everybody wants to go there so join emir

934
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
his talk um so you can join us in the

935
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
10th uh

936
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,280
to talk followability disclosure become

937
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
a member uh you can do all sorts of jobs

938
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
on communication on legal selling coffee

939
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
or you know new logo design stuff like

940
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,839
that

941
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,680
and it's fun to do

942
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,560
so

943
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
if you want us online you can do so if

944
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,200
you join us we can answer questions here

945
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
but also questions from the internet for

946
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
the people at home

947
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,800
are there questions from the internet

948
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
maybe later

949
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
oh

950
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,160
right

951
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,119
one

952
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,760
oh we have a question here so go ahead

953
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
hi um my question is do you have plans

954
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,720
for ipv6 and if so what are they

955
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,760
sorry

956
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
do you have plans for ipv6 and if so can

957
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,119
you tell us what they are

958
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,440
plans for ip version 6. well yeah we

959
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,079
can't just run a scan on ipv36 because

960
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,079
it's too large but do we have any

961
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,400
workarounds to involve that

962
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,359
well

963
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,040
one of the reasons we're here is is

964
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,560
because there's a great bunch of

965
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,440
brilliant minds here um

966
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
one of the obvious solutions would be to

967
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,680
ask everybody what your ipv6 range you

968
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,839
actually use and and give it to us to

969
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,720
scan

970
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
unfortunately that means we're we are

971
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,520
scanning for higher company then and so

972
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
ethically we can't go there

973
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,000
um otherwise i think the plans are

974
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,599
a bit hard we do

975
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,680
we are aware of the problem that's a

976
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,920
good start real actionable plans right

977
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,200
now no

978
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
it's just too large to scan the entire

979
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
space but there would be options like

980
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
looking at which blocks are announced

981
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,520
etc to reduce the space that you need

982
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,599
we're also in touch with an amazing phd

983
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,480
researcher in glasgow who does our

984
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,359
master thesis about this so we're aware

985
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
of the problem and we're looking how

986
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,560
we're going to scale up and how we deal

987
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
with it but for now

988
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,720
most servers still have an ipv4 address

989
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,680
so

990
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
we can just get by like if we do right

991
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,160
now

992
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,760
yeah plus if it's not that we don't

993
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,160
care about ipv6 if we come across and

994
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
show them something in the ipv6 range

995
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,520
and we can

996
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,480
uh

997
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,040
can can inform people we will

998
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,760
uh but it's just too big to scan or show

999
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
them or or other senses or other data

1000
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,320
so if or if a dns points to to ipv6

1001
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,359
we'll also

1002
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,680
include it but it's just yeah too big to

1003
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,599
scan for now

1004
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,680
okay thank you so if you want our scans

1005
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,920
you want to be safe don't use ip version

1006
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,119
6

1007
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,400
just a joke do use ipv6 it's the time

1008
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
that we start using this thing that's

1009
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,720
been around for years

1010
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
do we have enough questions

1011
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
yes now

1012
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,320
first of all thanks for all your good

1013
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,839
work i think

1014
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,680
drvd helps a lot of people and

1015
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
but my question is

1016
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,599
i see on the internet

1017
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,800
because of the privacy regulations that

1018
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
email addresses and these contact

1019
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,599
details get most time rejected

1020
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,800
how are you

1021
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
even

1022
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,359
able to find the email addresses to to

1023
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,280
the companies where that ip address or

1024
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
the domain name belongs after this

1025
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
redicted

1026
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
or does it make your work

1027
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
harder

1028
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
yeah so so so the internet unlike camp

1029
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,320
has very poor signage

1030
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,160
you can wander around and never know

1031
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,240
whose village you're in or which camp

1032
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,720
you're stumbling in and and there's not

1033
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
always helpful hints there

1034
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,839
um

1035
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,280
those companies that keep their whois

1036
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,440
database up to date with their reviews

1037
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,119
addressed thank you very much that

1038
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
really helps

1039
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,320
security txt is going to help especially

1040
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,640
the dns version is going to help us a

1041
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,720
lot because we don't just want to see

1042
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,359
your website we want to use dns to to do

1043
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,520
a reverse lookup and and get security

1044
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
information there

1045
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,400
um sometimes it's it's guessing uh

1046
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
there's countries where uh

1047
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
so so enough

1048
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,920
if you look at the ethnic database

1049
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
there's a lot of uh ip addresses that

1050
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,839
just a

1051
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,640
telephone number for abuse

1052
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
yeah i don't have the time to call all

1053
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,119
african isps

1054
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,480
yeah so

1055
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
please keep your whois records up today

1056
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,040
please put a security text in that

1057
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,079
really really helps us

1058
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,839
[Music]

1059
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,960
thank you for a presentation

1060
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
you were in the news a couple of days

1061
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,359
back

1062
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,720
regarding the

1063
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
solar panel uh

1064
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,760
stuff right yes correct

1065
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
oh yesterday uh great

1066
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,760
and that

1067
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,359
yeah it's of course very scary stuff and

1068
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,800
many thanks for all the hard work in

1069
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,160
that

1070
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,520
my question is

1071
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,079
are you any plans for other converters

1072
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,560
to check

1073
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,920
which ones do you have i have three

1074
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
goodreads

1075
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480
uh so so obviously this topic has our

1076
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,880
attention um

1077
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,760
on the other hand um we're limited by

1078
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,560
the number the amount of time we have

1079
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,920
we are doing competitor research

1080
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,800
we're not after certain vendors

1081
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
solomon just happened to be the unlucky

1082
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
one that we found first

1083
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,480
and

1084
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
yeah i guess the state of iot security

1085
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,720
would be another talk on itself

1086
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,440
okay thanks yeah and frank already did

1087
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
so if people are viewing at home i think

1088
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,520
what is this about look at the internet

1089
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,599
outage technology you called it right

1090
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,280
internet international outreach

1091
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
international technology and it was uh

1092
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,839
well we discovered a management panel

1093
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,200
for many uh

1094
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,920
converters and um yeah it needed to be

1095
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,839
closed off because well you can do nasty

1096
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,480
stuff with that so if you want to watch

1097
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,040
back that that talk it's it's available

1098
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
now

1099
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
you already gave an ex

1100
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,720
plan on expanding on going abroad and

1101
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,839
distributing dfid to other countries

1102
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,319
if we speak again in five years what

1103
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,119
what

1104
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,319
things would you

1105
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,680
have uh

1106
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
just yeah what would you like to see

1107
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,480
that happened or where you stand then

1108
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,079
i think that's a question we all might

1109
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,240
answer shall i kick off

1110
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,960
in five years we have grown from 100 to

1111
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
several hundred researchers

1112
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
to do all the work we need to do so each

1113
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,520
high is being scanned in a sufficient

1114
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,920
manner and also report it to the whole

1115
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
world so we need more researchers more

1116
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,400
sea cert people to do that

1117
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,760
also that it it is still a voluntary

1118
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,960
organization but uh yeah that these

1119
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,079
people are committed to stay with us

1120
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,319
three is that uh each country in the

1121
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,560
world has his own chapter

1122
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,400
and and forwarding our findings too

1123
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,599
we're already building in the

1124
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,160
netherlands our own network of trusted

1125
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,480
information sharing partners who put our

1126
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,440
notifications to their constituencies so

1127
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,599
like through internet service providers

1128
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,319
we had zert for for healthcare we have

1129
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,880
dtc for a small medium enterprise we

1130
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
have the national cyber security center

1131
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,040
for the government

1132
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
that model might be exported to other

1133
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,440
countries helping about so it's not only

1134
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,119
our effort but other countries are

1135
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,400
helping too

1136
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,800
and i hope that in five years we still

1137
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
exist and that we didn't have a court

1138
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,680
case which which bankrupted us so those

1139
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,119
are my four

1140
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,720
visions for the coming five years

1141
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,400
what is your vision for the coming five

1142
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,560
years for dfvd and also of course the

1143
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,800
academy

1144
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,400
well my vision is we will grow and the

1145
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,119
same point you gave but also that

1146
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,400
everybody

1147
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,040
will recognize us and know we are the

1148
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,200
good guys and girls and people we are

1149
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,760
the good people i must say

1150
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,079
for the academy i really want to be a

1151
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,960
real

1152
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,920
school

1153
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,480
where kids can be happy

1154
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,800
if you put a fish and a monkey in front

1155
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
of a tree and you say to the fish climb

1156
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
the tree then you know it will never

1157
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,760
happen but the fish has also very good

1158
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,160
skills so that's what we want to do with

1159
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,720
our kids our youngsters to tell them

1160
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,480
they're good enough for this world they

1161
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,119
are smart we're gonna teach them

1162
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
to use their skills in a

1163
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,839
ethical way and we gonna make sure they

1164
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,560
become our new generation of pen testers

1165
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,880
that is my dream that is victor's dream

1166
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,359
i know we also want to

1167
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,280
make sure that people who are sitting at

1168
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,200
home at the moment

1169
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,119
don't get a job

1170
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,960
because they have different skills we

1171
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
want to make sure they get the jobs they

1172
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,359
love they need and we need them so

1173
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,280
that's my vision for the future it's

1174
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,200
more about people

1175
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,560
and we're gonna

1176
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,599
make sure that we hack our way into the

1177
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,400
next

1178
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,960
generation because we were somebody has

1179
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,599
to do it so we will do this

1180
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,960
anyone else

1181
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,640
in five years well then probably people

1182
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,079
are fed up with me and you'll be the

1183
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,720
director of the ivd so where does dvd

1184
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,480
stand i was gonna start within five

1185
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,319
years i hope to do less managing and

1186
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,560
more hands-on hacking again but thanks

1187
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,880
for that

1188
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,520
no i think in five years that um

1189
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,119
i really hope we are

1190
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,400
reaching uh having global reach and

1191
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,880
having a better way of re um reaching

1192
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,040
potential victims because right now the

1193
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,160
abuser the rest is we rely a lot on isps

1194
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
forwarding our message

1195
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
and some of them do and some of them

1196
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,280
just refuse to work with us

1197
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
which is a shame because it means we

1198
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
don't reach certain people so i really

1199
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
hope we can find a solution to that part

1200
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,839
of the problem

1201
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,720
yeah so so being the crisis manager i'm

1202
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,040
going to hope for the best and

1203
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,599
plenty of boring job

1204
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,040
i'm gonna hope for the best and i hope

1205
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
that in five years we're going to stand

1206
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
here and say that the ivd is going to be

1207
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,160
reduced to just the academy because we

1208
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
were able to do zero cases in the in the

1209
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,319
last

1210
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,040
five years or in the last year

1211
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,280
um

1212
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,960
failing that i think we have a lot of

1213
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
ways to do to make that signage on the

1214
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,720
internet better

1215
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,240
to

1216
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
um right now scanning is a batch process

1217
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,680
so we scan there's a lot of verification

1218
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,720
messages

1219
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,319
read late and then

1220
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,880
they go to your isp or your colo

1221
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,960
provider or your network provider who

1222
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,400
might give it to your colo provider who

1223
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,760
might give to their customer who's the

1224
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,240
customer of another customer and then

1225
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,000
the message may never get there and i

1226
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,680
hope that we can in the netherlands

1227
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,760
build an infrastructure to

1228
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,119
automatically get these things there

1229
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,040
in minutes from us detecting there's

1230
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,319
something wrong

1231
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,079
and hoping to expand that that

1232
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,560
infrastructure globally so that people

1233
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,680
really get notified hey you have a

1234
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,560
problem

1235
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,720
uh really really soon

1236
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,800
so that we can do more cases reach more

1237
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,880
people and and maybe focus on finally

1238
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,839
fixing ipv6

1239
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
and as you have i've got a lot of

1240
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,079
questions

1241
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,079
this is very much seems a labor of love

1242
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,480
and that you've put in and grown up and

1243
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,040
passionate about what you do do you do

1244
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,119
you feel confident about being sorry do

1245
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,960
you feel confident about your

1246
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,079
funding and sustainability going forward

1247
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,880
well i i would rather turn it around

1248
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,359
at the fed many researchers are already

1249
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,960
doing this job

1250
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,200
and joining us you know it's a huge

1251
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,800
relief to see other people doing the

1252
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,680
same

1253
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,920
and you help each other out so so dfd is

1254
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,760
not only an environment where we try to

1255
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,079
make the internet safer but also improve

1256
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,200
ourselves by learning from each other

1257
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,119
but yes sustainability is difficult we

1258
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,359
do have some some funding both from

1259
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
government charity funds to get a little

1260
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,920
payment for a management layer but also

1261
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,559
for all our expensive i.t stuff we need

1262
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,800
but then again each time we try to buy a

1263
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,480
new server or a license incident they

1264
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,760
say oh you're a dvd here's for free go

1265
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,079
but bottom line is that if we don't have

1266
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,400
any money we'll we'll still be doing it

1267
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,559
so yeah i'm pretty confident for

1268
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,119
sustainability that is we might get into

1269
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,960
a difficult case for example like with

1270
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,200
solarman

1271
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,119
it might turn into a court case i hope

1272
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,559
not because

1273
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,319
i hope people see that it's necessary

1274
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,079
what we do

1275
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,240
any other comments on sustainability

1276
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
well i think i think sustainability for

1277
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,000
me i think if you're

1278
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,760
do something you truly believe and are

1279
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,119
you can do you can go on for a while

1280
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,599
i work

1281
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,160
i work for the ivd but it doesn't feel

1282
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,200
like work

1283
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,720
it feels like

1284
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,359
i get to be who i am

1285
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,119
and that for me is the most important

1286
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,800
part of

1287
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,400
of what i do

1288
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,880
yeah i agree with frank here and

1289
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,480
like chris said as well a lot of us have

1290
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
been doing responsible disclosure anyway

1291
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,119
and we would still be doing it

1292
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,839
without david or

1293
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
so if david lacks the funding we'll just

1294
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
continue doing what we do and keep doing

1295
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,760
the everyday because we started without

1296
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
a low funding as well

1297
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,200
it will make your job a lot worse

1298
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,240
well thank you very much indeed uh chris

1299
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,079
astrid frank

1300
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,640
and sorry they're not get my

1301
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,720
pronunciations right um

1302
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,870
thank you very very much indeed

1303
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,089
