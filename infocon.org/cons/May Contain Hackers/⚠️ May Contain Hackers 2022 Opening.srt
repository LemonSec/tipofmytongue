to be standing here there have been

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,819
hundreds of people working their asses

47
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,580
off for the years over year over year

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,280
doing this covet and we had to

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,959
cancel just one giant Nightmare and we

50
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
are finally here and we did it we have a

51
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,819
 awesome conference foreign

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,480
so yeah the the road to here was

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
interesting

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,940
to give you a few tiny highlights so we

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,040
had to cancel due to covet so we were in

56
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,739
organization mode and meetings and then

57
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,920
covet happens which ended up very bad

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,799
for a lot of people so pretty bad I'm

59
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,599
really happy to see people wearing face

60
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,580
masks and masks in this tent thank you

61
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,319
very much thank you

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,959
so and we got to the point where the

63
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,760
cash flow became a really interesting

64
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,500
issue

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,860
um and it was the point where uh prices

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,019
started raising we had to do down

67
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,700
payments really really early on

68
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,920
everybody wants to have full payments

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,159
because there was a lot of uncertainty

70
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,980
and it was basically a laboratory show

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,459
so that was not fun thanks to all the

72
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,659
people that did the start of donations

73
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,580
thanks to you we could actually do those

74
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,739
down payments and have a conference so

75
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,019
give it up for everybody that did a

76
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,860
startup donation

77
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,580
so in March this year we started

78
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,940
organizing like indoor die modes if Cove

79
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,979
it would happen that it would have

80
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,320
disastrous consequences mostly for the

81
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,479
people that have covered not for us so

82
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,220
I'm well aware

83
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,940
um due to the uh crisis uh covert crisis

84
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,820
the war in Ukraine and everybody and

85
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,440
their dog wanting to have a conference

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
this year we had a lot of issues with

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,979
suppliers

88
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,340
um it wasn't it wasn't the level of EMF

89
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,400
cam 2018 but it was a really uh terrible

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,919
and I want to give a shout out to the

91
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,139
people that fixed the water stuff in the

92
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,620
past few months especially uh lupus

93
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,160
reinder uh and people from PG rental

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,900
they basically saved the day and that's

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,859
why you have water now

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,440
and and even worse uh we had a power

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,139
issue like we ordered it way way back

98
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,280
when

99
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,620
um and aggreco is a company that we work

100
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,919
with they are very nice people but the

101
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,919
every uh piece of equipment that we

102
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,440
launched is still stuck in France so

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,680
what they did is get uh the generators

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
and everything else rushed from

105
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
Dominator Festival to here it was too

106
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,039
late it has burned up people it has we

107
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,320
still we again had to rent a lot of

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,680
people there were night shift and it was

109
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,479
basically very very very bad so uh be

110
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,819
especially nice to the power people and

111
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,000
consider helping out tearing it down

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
because they are all burned out because

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,900
of the late delivery and the complete

114
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,840
cluster fact that it uh

115
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
uh that it uh that ensued so but we have

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,259
power here thanks to the power team so

117
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,940
give it up for them and please help out

118
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
and there's some there's some other uh

119
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,259
very interesting points and this one is

120
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,160
actually

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
um not really the worst one but

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,979
um we work with own scouting uh scouting

123
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,800
estate uh it's a very nice place and we

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
work with scouting a lot uh in the past

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,360
I think three years to figure out a

126
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
contract and we were in their planning

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,340
system which worked great they

128
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,720
have this really nice planning system

129
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,660
and you can reserve your time slots

130
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,160
turned out to have two of them

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
oh

132
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,199
that's why there's a lot of Scouts here

133
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,759
and

134
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,539
we have like 1200 Scouts switching in

135
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,419
the next day few days and that causes

136
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,880
some interesting cultural differences

137
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,099
which I would like to highlight a few so

138
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,759
we reduce the amount of stress which is

139
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,599
basically this PowerPoint karaoke so

140
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,800
noise and music please be silent at one

141
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
it's so they can also have a nice sleep

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,259
there's a lot of kids very young kids

143
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,000
so if you have these of course you can

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,520
play music near it and and not at the

145
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,280
too loud volume but if you have like the

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,319
speakers that we have here or I don't

147
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,620
know gruffle or this stage over there or

148
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,400
any other Village basically

149
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,960
consider

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,639
being signed with one

151
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,300
um

152
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,460
also scouting doesn't have the concept

153
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,259
of villages now here you can walk in

154
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,300
every village and say hi and what do you

155
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,639
do and you get a tour and Etc scouting

156
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,900
doesn't have that they're basically

157
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,979
Islands so if you we're uh where I'm

158
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,620
asking you to not go into those islands

159
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,539
and if you really really really want to

160
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,520
talk to somebody from scouting out of

161
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,460
Interest their protocols basically wait

162
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,919
outside and ask if it's okay to come in

163
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,800
and then it might it might it might be

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,379
okay that you get a tour or something

165
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,099
but generally leave them alone so

166
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,479
they're they're really nice but there's

167
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,760
a cultural difference

168
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,360
um

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,599
and yeah please respect that

170
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,219
um and nobody asked for these double

171
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,799
bookings we didn't they didn't it's just

172
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,679
uh this is the situation at hand please

173
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,500
be kind be nice to each other and let's

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,880
all have a nice party thank you

175
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,800
there is a there is a a tiny visual cue

176
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
where the scouting part starts

177
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
so this is a Hint it also has some tape

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,140
around their their part so it will be

179
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,120
pretty pretty clear

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,899
um

181
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,279
let me see I did already do this so I've

182
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,519
got a the honor to uh do this section

183
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,940
new and improved so new hacker Camp new

184
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,560
stuff there's a lot of stuff that you

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,620
already know like a harbor and such

186
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,000
um this time we have a a these very

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,420
decent 200 gigabytes per seconds up and

188
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,660
down so

189
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,700
thank you

190
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I was asked to not use it for nefarious

191
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,100
purposes in some country so

192
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,380
10 gigabits wired for everybody

193
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,920
so

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
and they they have all kinds of new

195
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,339
technologies for the the network nerds

196
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,959
out there there's a blog post about that

197
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,480
on the site I want to highlight this

198
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,300
device which is a you cannot read it

199
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,399
it's a bit low it's a course wavelength

200
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,920
course wavelength deficient multiplexing

201
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,680
Optical at drop multiplexer

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,279
there you go

203
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,500
it has the it has the squirrel that

204
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,480
bites to the UTP cable that's the logo

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,860
of the Nook this

206
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,839
this thing that's new and improved is

207
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,640
the badge

208
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,600
I've got one here

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,519
there's no component shortage

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,220
it runs Doom I don't know if you can see

211
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,040
it but it actually runs Doom here it

212
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,899
basically can run doom on two chips I

213
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,160
heard they were engineering to

214
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
offloading the graphics so you can get

215
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
this 60 FPS experience

216
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,660
which you need

217
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,920
that's the logo of the batch team it's

218
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,899
it's it's here there is a an App Store

219
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,000
so if you need new kinds of ransomware

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,560
ideas or Shady payment systems

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,620
MCH

222
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,779
2022.badge.team and it has like tons and

223
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,820
tons of apps on it just like last time

224
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,459
you can define a python stuff with it

225
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,820
and please do there will be a badge

226
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,380
review talk they will hand out some

227
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,600
prices and stuff for the people that

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,060
make the most uh insane and crazy apps

229
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,800
so please do so thank you very much

230
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,779
[Applause]

231
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,440
um next up is something that is uh very

232
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,019
very new to hacker events which are

233
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,380
hoodies and not just any regular hoodies

234
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,420
they contain something that is

235
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,700
non-standard and maybe even out of the

236
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,920
norm that is a non-dark part

237
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,139
it's a

238
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,540
it's custom made everything just like

239
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,800
last time

240
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,320
um I I hope I can show it a little bit

241
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,060
uh the design made by Nicolette and a

242
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,180
bleep track so thank you there's a

243
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,040
butterfly uh with this nice prism effect

244
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,880
equations a patch it has of of course a

245
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,839
cyber label in it

246
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,339
yeah sure you can clap for cyber

247
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,360
so it

248
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
I did so it will stay long pretty long

249
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,860
and nice uh well above thingy

250
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,139
and yeah I like the sleeve so we are on

251
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,740
the way of making a maybe non-dark

252
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,839
hoodie next time it will take a few

253
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,000
years of development so give us some

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,420
time please

255
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,060
right then we have something else that's

256
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,639
special and therefore I need the hollow

257
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,519
plot uh people they are probably in the

258
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,920
room and they have a tablet where they

259
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,459
have demo effect so let's so uh there's

260
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,380
this audio system in this room which

261
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,440
yeah it's a small system and it does

262
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,060
something special

263
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,920
it basically can not just uh make noise

264
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,160
in the wide sense or like any direction

265
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,519
it can also do beams of noise so we're

266
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,800
going to play the the jungle thing

267
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
and you will hear different parts so who

268
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,040
hears the Crickets very loudly

269
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,540
mostly there who hears the birds

270
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,699
chirping very loudly

271
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:06,180
there's a stroke this light

272
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,060
uh what what else special things we have

273
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,779
the perfect records yeah there's a lot

274
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,660
of insects what we do tonight uh between

275
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,899
11 and 1 we have a session where we will

276
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,579
just experiment with it with the system

277
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,860
and you can walk around the funny thing

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,320
is that you can walk around the room and

279
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
have different points in the room for

280
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,760
different audio

281
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,339
but that's something new for example

282
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,560
they have a demo where you can walk

283
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,959
across the street like a virtual Street

284
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,779
and there you hear people clamoring and

285
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,459
there you absolutely don't hear them

286
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,240
which is crazy of course this is not a

287
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,459
really optimized stand for such a system

288
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,100
so tonight there will be a lot of

289
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
experimentation see where it works where

290
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,779
it doesn't work might work in another

291
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,100
room and Etc so I invite you to join it

292
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,620
will be music including the Dutch

293
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,600
traditional quality music at the end

294
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,360
so we can see how far it goes and how

295
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,279
well the base does it does their thing

296
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,019
and such

297
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,260
but it's a new system and uh dollar plot

298
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,120
people drove it all the way from Berlin

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,220
to here

300
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,079
with and it's the basically the most

301
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,180
expensive item on our insurance so

302
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,138
please don't break it

303
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,740
I think that's new is the uh MCH payment

304
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,220
system

305
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
it's the all-round spherical payment

306
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,480
system

307
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,440
with all kinds of excellent features

308
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,779
I've got it with me

309
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,660
actually we have a version two of them

310
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,180
our Engineers came up with a we can also

311
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,180
do this on paper and another engineer

312
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,980
came up we can also do this on plastic

313
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,519
so uh basically you can get a you can

314
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,820
exchange your money into a QR code and

315
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,519
pay on the field wherever you want you

316
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,500
can get Penny QR code so if you want to

317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,060
have vouchers of 10 euros and have

318
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,300
multiple of them fine if there's still

319
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,279
money on them in the end at the event

320
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,180
you get a reimbursement of course so

321
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,600
that's very nice and we have cashless

322
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,199
payments basically everywhere so

323
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,300
you can use your standard pin cards

324
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,160
credit cards whatever card payment you

325
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
have your phone you can use that just

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,620
like a supermarket basically

327
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,740
um and the QR codes I recommend the QR

328
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,339
codes because of a better anonymity

329
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,040
and there's a lot of complex stuff going

330
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,560
on there so if you want to be sure

331
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,579
better anonymity using QR codes

332
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,160
so I see a long line of people getting

333
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,680
QR codes tonight

334
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,000
um then there's a slide that I

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,660
accidentally left in so we can skip this

336
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,900
um something else that is new and

337
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,859
improved

338
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,640
is the the secret token game which is an

339
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,619
idea we got from bornak hello people

340
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,480
from barnac anyone here

341
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,890
give it up for barnac yeah

342
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,919
[Applause]

343
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,199
hacker conference uh in Denmark it's

344
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,840
after this one so if you think I need

345
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,059
more hacker conferences this summer yeah

346
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,360
you can you can just drive to Denmark so

347
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,000
so I have more more fun and there's just

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,760
a game where you can look for tokens

349
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
which start with secret and then to act

350
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,039
and Accolade or curly braces and a text

351
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,799
we need it you can enter that on the

352
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,600
secret token website and the more you

353
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,678
find it's basically

354
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
tokens.token.mch2022.org it's on the

355
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
bottom of the slide which you can

356
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,600
probably cannot see

357
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,340
and they're spread out through the

358
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,919
entire Camp everywhere there's tons of

359
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,820
them and uh yeah you can basically make

360
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,760
even more of them so

361
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,419
um

362
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,000
yeah you the challenge is to find them

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,860
all we have a nice price for us for the

364
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,140
people in the end that found the most we

365
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,940
have to figure out what that is but uh

366
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,280
that will be fine

367
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,559
another thing that is new and improved

368
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,840
is I'm wondering what happened to the

369
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,340
slide deck uh is the stage we have a a

370
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,980
laser show stage

371
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,539
I'm using lasering shows because of

372
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:44,520
licensing issues and there's also a

373
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,080
support with audio

374
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,419
it's a there was a sponsor that came

375
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,000
that stepped up said like we want to do

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,720
a stage because we like music oh

377
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,760
and we said no you cannot have music but

378
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,340
you can have lasers so hence the laser

379
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,639
stage

380
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,620
and if you like music making music

381
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,520
you're invited to uh yeah

382
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,020
do something there

383
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,280
Go full circle on this terrain so we

384
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,100
have like a circle along Route there's

385
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,179
this bridge

386
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,460
and you can basically walk through the

387
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,559
Azusa field which saves you like one

388
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,840
kilometer of walks between this track

389
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,660
and that field which is nice

390
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,880
it took two months of effort getting

391
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,780
this

392
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,480
just just these rubber things and the

393
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,940
bridge is two months of mailing back and

394
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,780
forth

395
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,500
thank you

396
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,200
I pity people that work in these permits

397
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,340
things

398
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,620
and uh something else that is new is the

399
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,299
supermarket we have a supermarket on

400
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,240
site and I'm just like 10 minutes ago

401
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,919
made this picture and I try to have no

402
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,559
people in it so it's not a very nice

403
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,700
representation it has basic this implies

404
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,380
they only have sugar and salt

405
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,320
I hope they have a bit more but at least

406
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,940
you can get some beverages over there

407
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,500
and so thanks for the supermarket

408
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
and the things we know and love such as

409
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
yeah finally normal people to talk to uh

410
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,260
for a few days

411
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,740
um villagers the family Village a lot of

412
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,860
Workshop tents attractants lasers flame

413
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,340
throwers

414
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,919
let me see if that works lasers

415
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
wow lasers yes

416
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,039
flamethrowers

417
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,919
a lot of retro gaming due to a sponsor

418
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,740
I'll get back to that a very inefficient

419
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,140
parking we have got vrp tickets if you

420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,020
play your cards right then you get a

421
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,940
golden shiny vrp ticket when you park

422
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,539
your car so you can try to obtain it if

423
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,659
you drive from the field and back

424
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:20,760
we have got a lot of different cards

425
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,039
this event try to collect them all

426
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,860
there's ton of them

427
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,260
if you get the VIP ticket you are asked

428
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,640
to park way way in the back

429
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
page a silent camping silent Lounge

430
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,440
again uh food food vendors there's a

431
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,740
party area capture the flag of course so

432
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,500
there's like you're at the camp and you

433
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,360
think you are here but you may basically

434
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,179
missing 80 percent by just being in this

435
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,659
room so that's that's how this works so

436
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,700
the program

437
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,179
there's uh there are hundreds of talks

438
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,659
um you can find more uh uh oh I switched

439
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,980
some slides

440
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,820
um so you can find it on

441
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,299
program.mch2022.org there are like

442
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,140
hundreds of talks for the next five days

443
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,880
um and every day there are lightning

444
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,280
talks I somebody rushed in the HQ said

445
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,020
like everyday they are lightning talks

446
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,960
okay every day there are lightning talks

447
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,679
um

448
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,299
and

449
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,220
um if that's not enough for you and you

450
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,220
need more clones of yourself to visit

451
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,840
more things at the same time there's

452
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,059
also a Wiki with self-organized sessions

453
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,799
also like Ade sessions up right now so

454
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:43,100
there's more than enough to do

455
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,260
for the entire day the content team has

456
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,539
been working like uh yeah for months

457
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,120
also hundreds of talks submitted

458
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,860
reviewed

459
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,520
um yeah and and some of the talks about

460
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,000
uh I don't know

461
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,340
um like

462
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm missing the English word for people

463
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,480
that have problems with that deny that

464
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,340
covet exists and all the other stuff

465
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,799
like blockchains and all the other stuff

466
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,860
has been

467
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,480
kicked and so we actually have a nice

468
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,820
program so thank you give it up for the

469
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,760
content team

470
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,960
[Applause]

471
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
so this time we have a lot of sponsors

472
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,059
it's ridiculous our sponsor slots have

473
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,720
been uh sold out except the diamond one

474
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,340
if somebody is in the room that wants to

475
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,740
throw away 50k on the hacker scene and

476
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
make sure the accusing gets better

477
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,779
then then we're mission complete but uh

478
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,419
the sponsor team has been working

479
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,460
insanely hard and they started calling

480
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,820
MCH many consumed hours

481
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,380
so

482
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,240
um and this is also the first time that

483
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,900
I Yeah we actually have to announce uh

484
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,460
sponsors during the opening talk because

485
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,700
yeah they did a lot of uh spend a lot of

486
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,760
money but also give something back in

487
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,299
the in the sense of content which we

488
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,580
wanted to highlight

489
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,799
um sponsoring and donations all together

490
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,799
is like the inflation correction of the

491
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,539
last few months

492
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,299
so if you know that the budget was 1.2

493
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,580
million euros then

494
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,700
it's it's it's like without normally

495
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,520
sponsors are just an add-on like we do

496
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
the normal stuff by by using the ticket

497
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,020
price and this time we could not live

498
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,000
without it and I think that's not a good

499
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,799
sign so we'll

500
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,620
um have to re-evaluate but uh making the

501
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,960
ticket like 600 euros is also not really

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,460
a good deal so it's such it's a struggle

503

518
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,900
except adding yens or something they

529
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,440
payment Terminals and and ridiculously

530
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,600
low transaction fees and such which are

531
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,900
basically not possible normally so uh

532
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,710
thanks to Adrian thank you very much

533
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,340
[Applause]

534
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,039
uh also Deloitte Deloitte is an auditing

535
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,659
firm but they also have a security

536
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,120
auditing part which is uh I think

537
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,059
actually the nice part of it uh they

538
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,580
also provide a separate track of content

539
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,039
which is on the wiki maybe it will be

540
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,080
also somewhere on the program and and

541
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,380
one of the uh Stripes of content they

542
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,480
have to unlock the city with with a lot

543
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,500
of talks there and Deloitte is actually

544
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,200
uh somehow interestingly our favorite

545
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,080
sponsor in one sense that is that

546
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,659
sponsors are really restricted in what

547
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,000
they can do we don't want to have

548
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,580
banners plastered everywhere with all

549
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,640
these sponsored logos and Etc and as the

550
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,159
lawyers from this company said like you

551
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,980
are not allowed to use our logo in any

552
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,679
other way except that the things that we

553
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,860
approve so well we like that so we don't

554
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,520
have to use it

555
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,299
but in case we need to refer to them in

556
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,580
the future there has been a company

557
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,140
asked to to make an alternative logo

558
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,779
which is using a different font a

559
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,080
different style a different tagline Etc

560
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,918
which is this

561
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,030
[Music]

562
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,539
so you know yeah it's not been

563
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,580
pre-approved but this is an entirely

564
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,120
different company

565
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,340
and just for the record to be nice to

566
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,039
all the other sponsors uh it barely fits

567
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,279
on this slide uh from uh gold silver

630
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,760
a special request from a Treasurer uh

631
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
Henry did all the insurance stuff and

632
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,640
and we were explicitly told we are not

633
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,620
insured against cyber

634
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,419

00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,260
so please uh yeah cyber is a problem uh

636
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,360
also if you want to know more please

637
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,299
check the booklet there are some at the

638
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,220
entrances you also probably got one when

639
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,260
you entered the camp it contains

640
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,380
everything you want to know about uh

641
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,720
yeah the family Village the phone

642
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,720
numbers imported opening times a lot of

643
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,260
practical stuff it also contains a map

644
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,200
which is slightly off-centered that's

645
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,539
but that works fine because you will

646
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,299
basically save it like this anyway so

647
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,760
there's also this map there are also all

648
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,640

649
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,820
a booklet is easy no it's not it's also

650
