1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:16,960
[Music]

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
for now let's start claudia

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
it's you and you're most welcome here on

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,119
stage again because you did on the chat

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,119
2017 you did a

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,519
writing workshop for nerds didn't you

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,520
here today

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
yeah there you are

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,160
yes

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,239
so you've been here before you know what

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
it is about nerds and writing um and you

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
write yourself as well uh it's novels um

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
i would call that creamies or is that

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,440
not crime novels prime novels yeah crime

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
novels um which are

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,559
probably mostly fiction

17
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
but you also wrote a non-fiction book on

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
how to be safe on the internet and not

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,000
so so you're really involved in in both

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
fiction and in

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,920
fact

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,640
so

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
for today

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
uh i think it's an international saying

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
truth is stranger than fiction we have

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
the same in dutch and i tend to turn

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,640
that around

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
um

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
fiction is stranger than

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
truth so no what is it true the same

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
thing nah i was going for the other one

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
not the truth of stranger than fiction

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
yes and currently is yeah yeah but i i

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,360
was going actually for the other saying

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
uh how was it it's too good to be true

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,040
and now

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
case it's good yeah it's too true to be

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
good so we live in a very strange world

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
so what can a storyteller writer do

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
about that especially in a

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
sense of science fiction and dystopian

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,479
nonsense that we're going to have here

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
starting

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
yes starting now claudia all yours

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
development for several years so i know

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
a bit of the technical stuff um

54
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
and

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
yeah the the big question

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,120
we have today is um

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
what's an author actually doing

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,959
this is what most uh nerdy people ask

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
themselves actually i'm asking that

60
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,239
myself uh

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,480
too most of the time

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
and um

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
as my lovely herald whose name i've just

64
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,280
forgot

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
eric hi eric howe as eric just said the

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
big question is how do we write stories

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,480
today

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,000
when the outside is getting so strange

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
it's already like a dystopia that what

70
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
we're living in

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
how can we create novels how can we

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
create movies how can we create stories

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,239
that still get people's attention that

74
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
can can be loved by people

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
when their reality world is already kind

76
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
of a dystopian story

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
um

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
the thing is uh we will be doing

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,760
uh a bit of storytelling ourselves here

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
today so you are going to develop a

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,879
story together with me

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
i will tell you how

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,040

together

91
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
okay so you're prepared to

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
interact with the story we're creating

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
here

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
but a bit of things

95
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
first

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,639
why

97
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,279
do we tell stories

98
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,940
any idea

99
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,079
[Music]

100
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,919
teaching

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
to convey meaningful points yes

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
any other ideas

103
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
to share concepts

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,639
entertainment

105
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,639
yes

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
ah yes live different lives in a book or

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
a movie or a

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
theater piece or whatever yes

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
and we're doing that for like

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,120
for forever so we've

111
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,840
as humans humans have always told

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
stories from the very beginning

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,440
and uh there are those um

114
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
um

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
signings on worlds that are basically

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,919
stories too how did

117
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,080
our tribe get the mammoth and so on so

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
those are very

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
early stories that have been told

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
throughout the times

121
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,320
it's a

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
basic human

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
thing

124
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,120
like

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
talking

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
like

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
having some kind of religious concept or

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
life concept

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,919
and stories are one of those concepts we

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,039
as human beings have

131
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
um

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
today

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
telling stories today

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
is a

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
quite interesting thing because we do

136
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
not only mirror what's happening in

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
society in our books and movies and so

138
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,319
on

139
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
but

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
we contribute to the overall discussion

141
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
we change what's happening in society we

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
bring up the concepts and the ideas one

143
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
of you said that earlier bringing up

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
concepts and ideas into the overall

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,840
discussion of our society

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,039
and we decide in books which topics are

147
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,560
relevant

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
so even

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
smaller authors or authors with not such

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560
a big influence like

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
andreas eschbachoso who has millions of

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
readers but also small authors like me

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
with a few hundred or a few thousand

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
readers

155
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,039
we do have an influence on

156
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,840
how and what is discussed in our

157
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,800
society so if we reach 30 people

158
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,160
then we have 30 people who get our

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
ideas in their heads and we're really

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
close to people with our

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
texts and our books and our stories in

162
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,840
the hearts of our readers

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,639
and if we reach 300 people and 300

164
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,800
people go out

165
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
and talk about those topics

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
then we've reached

167
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
at least 300 600 and so on people

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,479
and

169
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,039
even more if we're getting more

170
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
attention our books are being sold more

171
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,159
and so on

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,120
and

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,479
the thing is

174
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
it's not only relevant for us as authors

175
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
but it's relevant

176
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
for like everyone

177
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
so what are the topics of of our society

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,639
today

179
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,639
ideas

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
global threats yes of course

181
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
i.t security

182
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
to mention

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,639
nah

184
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
not not that important yeah

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,799
dystopias yeah

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
ai

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
it's a topic yes

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,520
other ideas over there probably

189
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
maybe

190
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,879
the question is why didn't we as a

191
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
society did not

192
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,240
remember as a whole that there was a flu

193
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,039
pandemic in 1921 and everyone was

194
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
wearing masks

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,959
why

196
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,519
any idea

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:37,940
yeah

198
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,360
[Music]

199
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,559
no one wrote a good story right

200
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
or a story at all

201
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
actually i don't know any story about

202
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
the the flu pandemic as a as a novel or

203
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,880
such i know there's uh one or two

204
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
non-fiction books on it but

205
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
we as a society forgot about it

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
we just forgot it

207
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
it's just a hundred years old and we

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
just forgot it how could that happen

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
because the discussion wasn't there in

210
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,399
society

211
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
it wasn't a topic

212
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
it's what happens right now with the

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
publishing industry publishers say no no

214
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
we don't take books on the pandemic

215
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
nobody wants to read that it's so awful

216
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
out there out there nobody wants to read

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
books with

218
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
people wearing masks we don't want that

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
and this is

220
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
a thing of relevance

221
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
this is a thing

222
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,200
where we have to take responsibility

223
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
as authors as publishers to contribute

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
to the discussion that this doesn't

225
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
happen again that the whole society or

226
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
whole world of several societies just

227
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
don't forget about it anymore

228
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
this is what happens

229
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
if topics are not discussed

230
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
and are not taken into culture and pop

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,880
culture

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,040
well

233
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
how do we tell stories

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
any idea

235
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
tick tock yeah

236
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
yes

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
fun

238
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
yeah very short stories yeah but in a

239
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
visual format

240
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
visual and audible yes

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,160
any other ideas

242
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
twitter

243
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,800
videos on youtube yes

244
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,560
we tell who tell jokes yes

245
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
books yes of course

246
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
magazines papers but they're all

247
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
mediums

248
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
they're all media of somehow but how do

249
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
we tell stories

250
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,079
yeah

251
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,199
beginning middle end

252
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,920
talking about darren back again that's

253
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
one side there's a christian redemption

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,079
maybe you want to take the microphone if

255
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
you say more than two or three words

256
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
that can easily repeat

257
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
hello yes um there's

258
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
a type of model that's there and back

259
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,000
again like tolkien road where you go out

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
have an adventure and return to a safe

261
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
nest and then there's the one hollywood

262
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
likes which is the christian redemption

263
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
story a man is a and he sees that

264
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
he's a kind and then he redeems and he

265
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
becomes a better person

266
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
yes and that's what we're doing today

267
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
um

268
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
there is a

269
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,720
uh a person called um what was his uh

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
first name joseph joseph campbell

271
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,440
uh he in the 1940s he did research and

272
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,040
wrote uh papers and and a book about it

273
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
it's called the hero's journey who's

274
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
heard of the hero's journey

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
about

276
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
a third of the people here okay

277
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,800
um

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,360
it's just what you said and and uh we're

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
coming to that in a bit

280
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
the first thing he found out is that

281
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,120
humans

282
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
all over the world

283
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,320
are telling stories quite similarly not

284
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
exactly the same

285
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
but quite similarly

286
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
and they're using

287
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
a very similar structure all over the

288
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
world

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
you have

290
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,040
a hero and she she goes out

291
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
in the world

292
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,079
and then she lives there and and things

293
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
happen and she reacts to them

294
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
and then she's growing

295
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
on what she's um yeah what she's living

296
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
and what she's experiencing

297
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
and then at some point she has to fight

298
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
a battle

299
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
and then she comes back

300
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
but where she comes back to

301
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
she has changed

302
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
and her old ordinary world where she

303
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
started out from

304
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,079
it's a different world suddenly for her

305
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,000
and this is what we're experiencing uh

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
it's experiencing right now

307
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
this outside has changed for us we all

308
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,279
have grown on the stories we've lived

309
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,720
through over the last two or three years

310
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
and suddenly

311
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
our ordinary world isn't that ordinary

312
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
anymore

313
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,959
or are we still in our story world good

314
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,160
question getting there

315
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
the thing is

316
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,000
if um if we as authors and storytellers

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
tell our stories and and work with the

318
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
topics we have today

319
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,000
as i said before it's our responsibility

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
to contribute to our culture to

321
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,840
contribute to our discussion

322
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,399
[Music]

323
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,519
it's not that important that everything

324
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
we tell if it's about probably i.t

325
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
security that everything is technically

326
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
correct in the smallest detail but it

327
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
has to be plausible

328
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
because

329
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
what we're writing i said before we're

330
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
reaching people out there we're

331
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
contributing to the discussion

332
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
we're reaching also political decision

333
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
makers

334
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
and suddenly

335
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,920
political decision makers think and

336
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
actually believe

337
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,240
it's really easy to do a hack back

338
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
and it's really a good idea to do that

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
because everyone in this room is skilled

340
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,079
enough

341
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,399
to just hack

342
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
let's say sweden

343
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
or china

344
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
or the u.s

345
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
because this is something you can just

346
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
do by being a hacker

347
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
or a nerd

348
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
because people write stories like that

349
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,800
and you know it's not that important

350
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
that we that this looks like it's done

351
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,199
in a minute

352
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
it's not important that it looks like oh

353
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,000
if you just pull out that that screen

354
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
cable that the internet connection is

355
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,519
gone it doesn't matter

356
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,160
yeah nobody's looking there that exactly

357
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
people look

358
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,560
people understand

359
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,880
stories on a real basic level

360
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,440
we understand stories not here

361
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
we are understanding stories somewhere

362
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
much much deeper

363
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,600
in our lizard brain

364
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,959
and this is

365
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
where those

366
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,399
fuzzy

367
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
uh ideas like though this is totally

368
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,199
easy to hack bikes on

369
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,320
whatever

370
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
the us

371
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,480
this is totally easy to do that this

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
they understand it on this basic level

373
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
and we just can't have that

374
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,120
so this is this is

375
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,480
a bag i'm giving out in the world to all

376
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,560
fellow writers

377
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,639
please don't do that

378
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,759
please

379
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,839
write

380
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,560
plausible

381
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,839
stories

382
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
they don't have to be exact they just

383
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,560
have to be

384
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,119
plausible

385
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,040
or realistic a tiny bit

386
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,880
okay

387
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,480
what do we need to tell stories

388
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,599
anyone

389
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,800
idea what do we need to tell a story

390
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
maybe into the micro to learn from

391
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
things that happen before so to remember

392
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
stuff that happens so he can become

393
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,359
better

394
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
yes

395
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,760
yeah

396
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,599
one or two steps ahead of me

397
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
no problem no i'm thinking about things

398
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,359
like

399
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,520
we need some characters

400
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
doing stuff

401
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
for a start

402
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,319
probably we need something like a

403
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
location or several locations

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
then we need stuff that happens

405
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,480
three three basic

406
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
ingredients that we need

407
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
for a story

408
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,039
and then

409
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,200
if authors

410
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
get

411
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
to their work

412
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,039
they're

413
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,840
yeah

414
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,679
the two far ends of how to write

415
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
a story

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,399
any idea

417
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,730
[Music]

418
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
same session

419
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,440
yeah so perspective is a thing yes

420
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,320
but

421
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
i'm at the author point currently so how

422
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
can we write a story as an author as a

423
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
writer

424
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
the two far ends are

425
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,720
the two one far end are the plotters

426
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,080
people who plot their story

427
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
and the other side the other far end are

428
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
the so-called pantsers or discovery

429
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
writers people sitting on the bottom of

430
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
their pants and discovering uh or

431
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
they're living their story while they're

432
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,559
writing it so they don't sit and make

433
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
the the most of the the work in the

434
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,640
beginning but they're doing most of the

435
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,799
work while writing and afterwards in

436
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,400
rewriting and and editing

437
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,679
those are the two far ends and everyone

438
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,600
you too me too is somewhere in

439
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,160
in the middle or at at some point on

440
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
that scale between plotter

441
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,280
and panzer or discovery writer

442
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
the thing is what we're doing today

443
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
we are plotting

444
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
actually over the years

445
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,799
i

446
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
realized i really love plotting

447
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,799
but

448
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,520
it can be too much and this is a

449
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
decision

450
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
based on which project i'm working on by

451
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,320
the way the project i'm currently

452
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,679
working on is a sci-fi dystopia

453
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
that started

454
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
here at shaw five years ago so not the

455
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
story world but the idea of the book

456
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
started here

457
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
after that creative writing workshop

458
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
yeah the beauty of plotting can look

459
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
like that

460
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
um

461
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,039
yeah it's my pin board that i used

462
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
at home

463
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
this is how i'm actually working

464
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
currently

465
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
with lots of small

466
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
cards

467
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,320
writing my ideas on on them and putting

468
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,360
them

469
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,240
in the matrix

470
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,000
i'm doing that

471
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
like that only for a few years now but

472
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,760
that all started at university when i

473
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,880
came across that book it must have been

474
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
1999 or 2000

475
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
one of one of the earlier semesters when

476
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
i was studying english literature

477
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,080
there's a much newer version today so

478
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
there was like a 25 years

479
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
special edition of it and christopher

480
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
fogler

481
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,520
he took what that joseph campbell

482
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,440
found out and in the 1980s he put that

483
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,679
in

484
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
in a structure that hollywood authors

485
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
could work with

486
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
so he

487
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,000
yeah

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
translated

489
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
the the work of kenpel into

490
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,400
something really handy for hollywood

491
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
authors

492
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
in the last 25 years there have been

493
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
lots of people working with story

494
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
structure

495
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
and

496
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
i had a look at it and compared some of

497
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,880
them

498
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
and um

499
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
they all have still

500
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,120
basically the same

501
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
structure the

502
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,880
same same matrix but with

503
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
some diff uh differences between

504
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
so how does story structure work

505
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,280
hmm okay

506
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,799
generally we're talking about the story

507
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,960
structure today not so much about single

508
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
characters and so on

509
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
um and

510
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,919
what i'm talking about

511
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,880
will have contents from joseph campbell

512
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
the hero with a thousand faces

513
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,760
uh from christopher fogler the writer's

514
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,159
journey blake snyder and jessica brody

515
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
saved the cut

516
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,159
ulrich dietman and eurenka york with a

517
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
new version of the hero's journey as

518
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,240
taught at the romance rule in germany

519
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
and which is not yet included but

520
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,039
already somewhere in my mind is gail

521
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,679
carriger the heroine's journey so all

522
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,240
what i'm talking about today this will

523
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,200
be

524
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
at the end again so

525
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,440
um

526
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
these are um

527
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
yeah terms

528
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
that are

529
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
from four different

530
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
heroes journey

531
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
um

532
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,000
concepts

533
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,240
okay let's start fresh

534
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
let's take the board uh the picture by

535
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
the way is by matt's bark just to have

536
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
said that

537
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
we're here

538
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,559
i hope you can see that a bit so we have

539
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,000
our board clean for today i hope you can

540
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,840
read that is it okay for you

541
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,559
good

542
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,000
what the first thing we we know of our

543
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,080
story

544
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,919
we're working in a

545
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,480
three act structure that's a beginning

546
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
middle end thingy

547
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,520
um

548
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,200
but the middle act act two is

549
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
cut in half

550
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
uh so we have act one act two a act two

551
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
b and act three

552
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,678
this is our story structure for today

553
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
um there by the way

554
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,080
many more story structures like a story

555
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
orchestra mouse that what

556
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,320
um

557
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
aristotle has with his three

558
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
act structure and so on so don't get

559
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
nervous if if you want to read into

560
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
those things that things could um sound

561
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,600
differently

562
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
okay what we first know of our story

563
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
structure is

564
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,200
at the end of each of those acts

565
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,720
we have

566
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
a yeah a turn into the next act or the

567
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,919
next

568
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,440
half act

569
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,320
so we have a break into act two we have

570
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
a midpoint in the middle

571
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
we have a break into act three and we

572
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,880
have

573
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
the end the final image as which is from

574
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
blake snyder so if you think in the

575
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
movie we have that final image where we

576
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,159
are working towards

577
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,840
what what are we starting with

578
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,679
well

579
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,880
oops

580
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,159
with the opening image

581
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,559
was a bit too fast but

582
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,120
okay we have our opening image

583
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,159
our

584
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,640
ordinary world where we start at

585
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
what's our ordinary world if we say

586
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,679
we're

587
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
doing a story today what's our ordinary

588
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,640
world now

589
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
ordinary

590
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
weeks before

591
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
that's right so here at hakka cam at mch

592
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
our ordinary out there is quite

593
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,200
different from mainstream society that's

594
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,720
probably true

595
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,360
okay let's think of so the setting here

596
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
would be it was a lovely sunny day at a

597
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
hacker's camp somewhere in netherlands

598
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
okay it was a sunny day

599
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,000
at a hacker's camp lovely hackers camp

600
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,760
in the netherlands

601
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,840
okay who's our hero

602
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,240
[Laughter]

603
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,799
yes our herald eric is crawling out of

604
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
his tent

605
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
so this would be our first image and

606
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,039
eric is our hero obviously

607
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
a herald called harold

608
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
okay

609
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
okay what we also have is

610
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,120
who is

611
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,919
oh

612
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
what we also have in stories meeting a

613
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,080
mentor a mentor who is going through the

614
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
story for

615
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,120
some parts together with the hero

616
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
um

617
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,120
let's think gandalf

618
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
yeah it could be a speaker that talks

619
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
about a topic that he's very interested

620
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
in

621
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
okay a speaker

622
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
who yes always looked up to

623
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,799
and he's really looking forward to

624
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,159
seeing her talk

625
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,880
okay so harold is very looking forward

626
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,919
to see

627
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,159
a talk of a speaker he's always wanted

628
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,120
to see um

629
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,199
okay you're the speaker then

630
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,799
okay and what we also have

631
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,640
as as a concept in basically every story

632
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,919
and what we need to tell a story

633
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,640
are antagonists

634
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,320
what who

635
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,279
is

636
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,559
our hero

637
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,919
against

638
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,799
up so

639
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
it can be a person it can be a group of

640
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,520
persons

641
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,279
it can be

642
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,840
nature

643
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,840
or it can be something like climate

644
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
change

645
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,600
it can be political

646
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,559
who politicians who don't want to change

647
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360
anything about

648
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,720
a system

649
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,640
because it's cool to drive porsches

650
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,520
like the police

651
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,480
okay

652
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
i know the the dutch police went to see

653
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
the greenpeace people after they gave

654
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,520
their talk so how about

655
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
eric doesn't know he's opposed to the

656
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,159
police

657
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,640
but he's not the best of hackers he's

658
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
not the most popular of hackers

659
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
and then he discovers the person sitting

660
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,760
or sort of in the tent next door is

661
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
actually from the police here to

662
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
investigate

663
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,279
oh there getting there in a minute

664
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,840
getting there

665
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
okay getting there

666
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,919
we can do that by the way uh in the

667
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,840
1980s who's

668
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,200
as old as me

669
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,799
might may probably remember in the 1980s

670
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,480
lots of

671
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,320
stories lots of tv series and so on we

672
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,279
saw

673
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,640
um had corrupt police

674
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,679
in them

675
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,000
and at some point not so many years

676
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
later like everyone

677
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,240
was thinking

678
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,760
the police in the us are always corrupt

679
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,399
some people nodding yeah

680
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,000
this is what i meant by our

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,360
responsibility as writers

682
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,480
because we shape our society we shape

683
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
the beliefs of people

684
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,360
like

685
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,760
every policeman or policewoman is

686
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,799
corrupt

687
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,279
at least when are living in the u.s

688
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,330
that has to be like that

689
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,279
[Music]

690
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
they changed it currently

691
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
the place can do everything

692
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,799
in

693
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,080
shorter time than it needs to log in

694
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
into his system

695
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,240
this is what people think today

696
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,480
and this is what politicians think today

697
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,919
not only you or me or the neighbor or

698
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,880
our grandmother or anyone also

699
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,279
political decision makers think that way

700
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,840
because culture is like that and this is

701
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,440
what culture tells you

702
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,919
everything is so easy

703
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,640
and just takes a minute or less

704
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
okay so

705
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
we have

706
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,880
our opening image harold is crawling out

707
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,840
of his tent at the hacker camp

708
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,039
we have

709
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,520
the mentor the speaker who's giving a

710
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,039
talk

711
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,159
and

712
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,200
we have antagonists probably we've seen

713
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
them when we think in movie yeah

714
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,760
probably we've seen a police car

715
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,120
somewhere out at the fence while

716
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,279
we have this um

717
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,320
yeah a view over the camp

718
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
or at the entrance

719
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
okay let's go on

720
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,440
we have

721
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
a call to adventure

722
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,720
something

723
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
happens

724
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,760
what could that be

725
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,279
it was your idea with the police

726
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,880
so how does harold

727
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,000
actually get to know that the place is

728
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
out there

729
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,320
and

730
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,760
is after that speaker

731
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,159
any ideas

732
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
well

733
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
probably the microphone to

734
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,000
harold eric

735
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
or harold harold

736
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,399
well that's easy um because as somebody

737
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,559
already mentioned he's sleeping in a

738
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,000
tent next to the

739
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,880
the the the police person

740
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
so he probably overheard it in the night

741
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,000
somewhere

742
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,799
oh okay he overheard

743
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,399
it at night

744
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,880
and then undercover policeman is an

745
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,360
attempt next to harold

746
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,240
oh

747
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,799
okay yes

748
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,360
are we painting ourselves into a corner

749
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
a bit where we're putting the speaker in

750
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
both the

751
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,360
the um mentor situation and the damsel

752
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
in distress situation which makes it

753
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
difficult for her to mentor harold

754
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,080
yes and no

755
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,640
because only you have characters in a

756
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,840
book and they can actually change

757
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,720
roles so

758
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,600
if we're thinking about okay this is a

759
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
beginner's story and we're the first

760
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
it's our first story ever short story 10

761
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,120
pages and we have people changing their

762
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,320
roles uh like on twice on every page

763
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
that

764
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,360
can be difficult but i don't mean

765
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,919
difficult roles wise i mean practical if

766
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,679
the police is coming to take her away

767
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
she's not here to mentor harold

768
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,080
depends

769
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,000
for like 10 minutes she can be

770
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,360
for 10 minutes she can do that

771
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,678
can you please talk in the microphone

772
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
harold will grow to see that he's really

773
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,320
the hero and can do just as much as the

774
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,480
person he thought was his mentor

775
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,399
so that's

776
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
that will work out fine for us

777
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,399
we're getting there a bit later so let's

778
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,799
talk about act three when we're at at

779
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,799
three

780
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,840
okay so we've got our cool

781
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
whoops

782
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,399
call to adventure

783
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,159
and now

784
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,320
it's got a longer time

785
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,760
with its so-called debate

786
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,120
okay shall i shall i tell anyone

787
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,480
shall i tell people should i alarm the

788
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,440
speaker should i go to the auger should

789
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,640
i

790
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,840
the note burn down the tent should i

791
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,960
hear it

792
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,360
did i hear it correctly did i make a

793
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,480
mistake

794
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
when i overheard

795
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
what was being

796
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,679
said yesterday night

797
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,880
or

798
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
problem

799
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,279
what's my risk in telling right

800
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,600
so there is a whole

801
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,039
part of the story that's

802
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,639
yeah undecided what shall i do

803
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,399
and harold is sitting in front of his

804
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,960
tent drinking his first morning coffee

805
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,440
not sure yet if he's alive or not or

806
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,399
called harold at all

807
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
and suddenly

808
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,040
it dawns on him

809
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,079
damn i really heard that

810
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,359
so

811
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,520
and now

812
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,839
what's he doing

813
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,000
now hmm

814
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
yeah first there's a refusal okay i

815
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,280
don't

816
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,960
want to have

817
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,000
anything to do with that it's too risky

818
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,879
nah come on i'm not the real real

819
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,918
best guy to do that um

820
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,199
i can't do anything why should i

821
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,040
go to the police or why should i go to

822
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
the org or whatever

823
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,390
yeah

824
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,839
[Music]

825
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,800
because team cohen yes

826
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
and

827
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,599
the hero in a story

828
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
is always

829
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
the character

830
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
that changes the most throughout the

831
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
whole story

832
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
learns the most throughout the whole

833
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,839
story

834
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,920
so at some point

835
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,839
because there was some author at the

836
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,160
beginning who said you harold

837
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,800
you are the hero

838
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,839
come on

839
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,520
yeah at some point

840
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,800
he's crossing the threshold

841
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,839
this

842
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,720
he has to get out he's exiting his tent

843
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
and now

844
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,479
yes

845
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,599
so we could say he goes to before he

846
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,280
crosses the threshold he goes to the

847
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
talk and the speaker that he's advised

848
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
for so long announces that she's up to

849
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
something that's sort of in the

850
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,960
borderlands between good and bad

851
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,520
so now he has the thing oh

852
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,839
which one of them am i and he talks to a

853
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,400
person who's like the chat person

854
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
that we always have in the american

855
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
movies oh he's good enough he can do

856
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,960
something

857
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
and then later that night that guy's

858
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
just out drunk and he sees police

859
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,920
mobbing and that's the threshold ish

860
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,400
getting there getting there because

861
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
we're getting into

862
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,320
act two

863
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,200
or act two a actually

864
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,480
so

865
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
this is the second part of the first

866
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,599
half

867
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
towards the midpoint between crossing

868
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
the shuttle to actually getting into the

869
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,640
story going out

870
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
starting

871
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
the travel

872
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
and the midpoint this is what they call

873
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,240
the promise of the premise

874
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
this is where all the trailer material

875
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,000
comes from

876
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,040
so this is the fun and games part also

877
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,440
for the writer themselves

878
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
to

879
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,880
live through everything we've got

880
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,800
real hacking

881
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,280
real police

882
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
probably police harassing someone

883
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,640
probably

884
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
other people coming into the whole

885
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,640
action people following each other

886
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,800
people following each other yes with

887
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,640
e-scooters or on

888
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
motorized tents

889
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,079
yes

890
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,240
yes that's that's where it's happening

891
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,640
a low speed chase yes

892
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,079
yes people watching the fire show and

893
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,280
the tesla coils and all that

894
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,760
that would be happening and that fun and

895
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,119
games part

896
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,359
except for those things that we actually

897
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,400
need

898
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,720
for the story probably a bit later then

899
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,160
we can put it in a story later but

900
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,880
the the real the real fun part and

901
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,040
showing everything we've got in our

902
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,320
toolbox

903
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,920
this is act 2a

904
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,119
towards the midpoint

905
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,280
and then

906
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,040
oh yes and we have of course a b story

907
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,000
what's the b story

908
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,480
idea

909
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
yes the less important storyline or the

910
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,599
second storyline like probably a love

911
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,680
story

912
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,280
so harold could find a new boyfriend

913
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,240
or a new life partner

914
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,079
of which

915
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,800
uh definition at all

916
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,520
who's a police officer

917
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,040
right

918
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
so act 2a

919
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,320
often starts in movies at least with

920
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,200
the b story

921
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,440
whoopsie

922
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
yeah and then the midpoint happens

923
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,520
the midpoint is always

924
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
mostly

925
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,079
either a wrong victory

926
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,880
or a wrong defeat

927
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,400
when we're saying okay we're talking

928
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,359
about

929
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,000
this should be a dystopia

930
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,040
then the midpoint would be a wrong

931
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,079
victory

932
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
because everything looks good and

933
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
afterwards everything just goes down

934
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,040
if we're saying okay harold

935
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,960
may have a happy ending and may have uh

936
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
a great story and um

937
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,880
the story

938
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,560
is supposed to go out the positive way

939
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,960
then the midpoint would be

940
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
a wrong defeat

941
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,839
oh no

942
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,040
they actually arrested her

943
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,320
oh dear

944
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,880
what now

945
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
hmm

946
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,200
look into act 2 b

947
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,119
the bad guys close in long time of act

948
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,400
2b

949
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,000
so now it starts getting really

950
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,359
really down

951
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,400
so

952
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
what could happen there

953
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,800
we need an interrogation scene yes

954
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,880
and because this is a hacker camp

955
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
someone was hacking into the police

956
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,000
office faster than it takes to log into

957
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
windows 10.

958
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,880
and then

959
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
half of the camp can hear what's

960
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,079
actually been said in the

961
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,400
in that interrogation probably

962
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,720
yes

963
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
in a silent disco with a green oh yes in

964
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,800
the silence in the silent lounge when

965
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
you're sitting there with help

966
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,160
because they don't have sound

967
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,200
good one yeah and with the green headset

968
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,240
that

969
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
doesn't have any sound

970
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
sounds good

971
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,040
yes

972
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,040
and then there's that point all is lost

973
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
oh no

974
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,119
they actually put her in the cell

975
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,079
and it starts raining at the camp

976
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,960
yes lightning hits the abacus stage

977
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,680
yes the the lightning hits the abacus

978
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,078
stage

979
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,400
honey

980
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,480
also

981
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,160
in movies you

982
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,440
mostly

983
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
in most movies you have at that point

984
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,560
the so-called whiff of death

985
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,880
so you see something that either there's

986
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,240
a real death

987
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,800
or you see a dead plant or something or

988
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
whatever

989
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
so in in in the movies

990
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
next time you see a movie and you see

991
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,920
something dead

992
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
you probably

993
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,000
at the oldest lost point

994
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,960
just

995
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,599
think about it

996
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
okay

997
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,720
then dark night of the soul

998
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,200
it's a bit similar to the refusal of the

999
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,160
call debate stuff so oh no

1000
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,359
everything is lost what can we do

1001
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,640
we need

1002
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,800
someone who can break them out probably

1003
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,839
lock picking people

1004
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,599
this is the this is the part that was

1005
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,560
called

1006
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,839
ordeal

1007
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
at fog line campbell

1008
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,880
so it's real real hard for harold at

1009
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
that point okay what to do

1010
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,200
now we're getting into break into act

1011
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,400
three

1012
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,359
they're

1013
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,280
taught a bit differently in the u.s it's

1014
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,119
called as an aha moment or for

1015
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
um

1016
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,200
for comedies that could be a aha moment

1017
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
so i can i can

1018
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,880
handle it that way and could be better

1019
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,760
than

1020
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,720
or

1021
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,880
in the german tradition or it's taught

1022
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
in in germany it's an acid test and a

1023
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,119
failure

1024
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,839
of

1025
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,599
the hero

1026
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,200
so

1027
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,240
harold

1028
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,960
goes to the lockpicking people

1029
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,280
gets his team they're going to the

1030
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,400
police

1031
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
they're trying to get her out

1032
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
and now they end up in cells themselves

1033
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,359
oh no our failure

1034
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,480
and

1035
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,319
we're

1036
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,640
sliding into the so-called finale

1037
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,720
in the um blake snyder version it's the

1038
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,680
whole act three is only called finale

1039
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,520
okay great

1040
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,760
what does it mean

1041
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,319
we don't know

1042
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,160
at campbell and fogler they have the

1043
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,880
more mythical approach with reward and

1044
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,280
the road back

1045
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,880
and the resurrection of the hero

1046
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,240
and the return with the alex here to his

1047
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,280
home village

1048
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,520
not quite that but what we learned from

1049
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,319
it

1050
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,480
what he said earlier

1051
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,720
we have

1052
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
a circle being closed in act three

1053
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,760
so

1054
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,040
the hero comes back

1055
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
to his home world so what we're thinking

1056
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,240
about now is how do we get harold out of

1057
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,280
prison

1058
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,520
and all the rest and the speaker and

1059
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,640
back to hakka camp

1060
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,920
probably the microphone over to

1061
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
eric

1062
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,800
yeah but i don't use that because that's

1063
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
differently

1064
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,040
um

1065
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,480
maybe because the uh uh the b story the

1066
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,880
boyfriend from the b story helps

1067
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,800
maybe the boyfriend from the b story

1068
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,960
helps this is a good one

1069
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,520
okay let's have a look in our thing a

1070
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,800
catastrophe happens so we're sitting in

1071
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,160
jail

1072
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,839
everyone's sitting in jail probably

1073
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,920
except that boyfriend because he's not a

1074
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,560
skilled block picker and was

1075
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,599
sent to get marty

1076
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,240
oh and this is the police officer right

1077
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,880
so we have the other police officer

1078
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
not a skilled lock picker

1079
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,680
but

1080
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,760
he can gather inside information

1081
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,400
we've got the maturing of the hero

1082
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,720
funk in german so

1083
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,599
he learns okay

1084
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,800
i can actually do stuff

1085
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,960
i can be as good as the speaker herself

1086
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,640
i can get us out of here

1087
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,879
and

1088
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,839
then

1089
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
we've got things that he's

1090
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,400
yeah initiating yes please

1091
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,800
just a thought go in the other direction

1092
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,880
make him discover that his boyfriend is

1093
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,280
actually the bad guy here

1094
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,119
we can do that too

1095
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,319
the whole arrest should never have

1096
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,280
happened etc and this is certainly a

1097
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,880
learning moment for him a maturing

1098
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
moment it is but how can we get him out

1099
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,359
then

1100
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,839
if well fraud vitiates everything in law

1101
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,200
so the whole arrest should never have

1102
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
happened when that turns out and now his

1103
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,000
big choice i suppose would be

1104
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
whether to rat on his boyfriend

1105
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,720
in the police

1106
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,560
and break up his potential life

1107
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,640
happiness

1108
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,440
or keep that quiet and become complicit

1109
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,880
hmm

1110
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,240
okay

1111
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,319
so we need a character so when we're

1112
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,960
saying okay we we started like that are

1113
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,160
we at that point yes please

1114
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,640
yeah i was more thinking that maybe the

1115
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,319
boyfriend had been

1116
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,040
sort of opposed to sort of oh no i can't

1117
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,720
do anything there may not be police

1118
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,560
officers but an i.t person working for

1119
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,599
the police

1120
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,119
and now they use that to crash the

1121
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,720
system or something but if we go with

1122
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,480
the thing with the boyfriend being the

1123
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,599
reason for it then he can break out oh

1124
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,520
but i know that this boyfriend likes

1125
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,000
so-and-so so i can use that as his

1126
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,559
passport and i saw password and i saw

1127
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,640
something so can i have my phone call

1128
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,400
and he uses the phone call to act as a

1129
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,200
police terminal and something

1130
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,720
go on

1131
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,040
of course he knows the name of his door

1132
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,760
oh yes he knows the name of his dog this

1133
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,480
is really good

1134
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,520
and

1135
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,680
the other thing is i'm still missing the

1136
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,480
dragons since we've got two dragons

1137
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,920
on site

1138
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,800
i think we should somehow get that fire

1139
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,760
making dragon to the police station come

1140
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,880
on for the for the whole climax thing

1141
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,400
we just need it for for a bit

1142
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,599
just for the for the visual effects

1143
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,040
we could say that the the bile police

1144
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,800
was on site

1145
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,200
because they were so evil they also

1146
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,960
called the fire department for the

1147
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,520
dragons but it turns out

1148
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,400
the firemen or one of the firemen is

1149
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
sort of in the same lgbt community as

1150
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,040
the hero

1151
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,280
so therefore he says oh

1152
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,599
these dragons are fine but i can use

1153
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,079
this to go to the police station and i

1154
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,480
don't know use my host to get them out

1155
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,520
oh no he has a he's a fireman he has a

1156
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,800
ladder

1157
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,160
great

1158
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,440
okay we're getting out of this good

1159
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,839
and then

1160
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,800
the whole

1161
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,400
end is okay we're wrapping up whatever

1162
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,559
we still have open

1163
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,119
and of course we're going to the final

1164
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,680
image as we think in movie we're going

1165
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,119
to the final image our changed hero

1166
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,960
probably has got some

1167
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,839
marks from the handcuffs or whatever not

1168
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,760
the furry ones

1169
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,960
yeah close to the close to the mch

1170
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,200
benzies

1171
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,680
and his new normal

1172
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,760
and then we arrive

1173
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,119
at a new

1174
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,640
normal

1175
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,720
back at the hakka camp

1176
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,200
and suddenly we see

1177
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,880
the world through harold's eyes

1178
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
in a new light probably

1179
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
more blinky

1180
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,200
with more tesla coils

1181
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
and probably even

1182
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,599
with

1183
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,920
another boyfriend

1184
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,839
the fireman

1185
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,280
yes

1186
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,200
and happily that is the moment that

1187
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,920
harold gets his own moment of fame on

1188
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,440
the stage and of course that's on

1189
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,079
clairvoyance stage because abacus was

1190
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,839
hit by lightning

1191
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,520
hooray

1192
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,280
thank you very much cheers

1193
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,839
harold

1194
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,359
claudia thanks civilian this was great

1195
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,640
this was

1196
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,920
fun this was a a huge

1197
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,119
um

1198
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,119
i would say it was a lovely waste of

1199
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,760
time but it sounds it sounds

1200
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,319
but you know what i mean yes and this is

1201
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,440
what we actually do as authors

1202
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,400
that we write the stuff that brings all

1203
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,079
of us

1204
