00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,119
hello everyone uh the title of this talk

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,400
is technology did not create

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
misinformation and it's not going to

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,279
solve it either

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,519
uh basically

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,519
yep there we go uh try not to waste your

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,920
time there's a lot of research to be

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
done a lot of people

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
are doing a lot of research a lot of it

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
is fairly awkward a lot of it is useless

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,320
there's a lot of wasted money so i'm

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,760
here to talk through

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
what we can actually do where hackers

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,120
can help

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
and how to stop putting good money after

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
bad okay so who am i uh as mentioned

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,559
before i'm the lead technologist of the

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,640
duke university reporters lab in the

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
sanford school of public policy because

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
academics like longer titles and

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
apparently that makes us more important

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,719
um i'm a journalist computer scientist

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,760
i've worked as a reporter and

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
photojournalist around the world i live

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
in new york city

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
and i've been working on misinformation

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
since about 2015.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
previously i lived in worked over here

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
uh in bosnia with a couple of the folks

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,759
up front and so i've been dealing with

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
this from a lot of different origins and

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
a lot of different places okay first

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
thing we're going to do is go over some

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
nomenclature words matter i hate

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,799
definitions they get in the way people

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
get really pissy about them however a

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
couple of them are really important

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
including misinformation so what this is

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
is it's false information and it's

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
spread without malice this is your aunt

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
this is your uncle this is your mother

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,280
this is you it's me sometimes i've

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
definitely done it spreading

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
misinformation on accident you think

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
it's real you think what you're sharing

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
is important and then what you end up

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
doing is pushing it out on accident

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,520
second one is going to be disinformation

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
say this is the same information but its

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,960
intention is different so instead of

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
accidental these are the people who are

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,119
creating it who know it's false this is

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,080
the disinformation that we're discussing

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
and when it comes to fact checking

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
there's two variations so

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
this usually uh goes over with

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
journalists but i'm just gonna make it

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
just uh go over it real quickly for you

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,640
guys so that if you hear it in a couple

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
different contexts it makes a little bit

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
of sense

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
the first type of fact tracker that

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,959
really existed within journalism in

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,280
general is internal fact checking and

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
what that is is you do an investigation

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
you write a piece you spend weeks you

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,879
spend months you spend years on it and

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
then somebody else in your organization

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
at your publication what have you goes

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
through and fact by fact tries to

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
reconfirm a lot of this right so you can

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
call people you can make sure that the

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
stats add up etc uh the journalists

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,239
hands over their sources and you run

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
through it

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,879
uh sometime in the mid 90s

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
people started considering what external

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
fact checking is so taking those

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
techniques but flipping them out and

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,800
using them on people who have made

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,760
claims in public politicians scientists

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
uh you know what have you

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,959
and that's the type of fact check and

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,159
i'm going to be talking about today it's

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,280
the type you've been hearing about for

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
the last decade it's the type that's

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
really been uh increasing in size around

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
the world there's over 300 fact checkers

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,720
these days

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,599
okay

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,640
so

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,519
can technology solve misinformation

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,319
no

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,760
it cannot uh there is no algorithm there

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,440
is no ai model there is no anything that

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
is going to catch all misinformation and

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
make truth valid

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
and you know there what is truth anyways

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
but let's not get into the universal

101
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
philosophies here

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,159
but it's not anybody that says this is

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,239
going to fix misinformation on facebook

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
including facebook by the way

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
is wrong

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,959
now

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
is this information caused by technology

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
this is the problem it is not so that's

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
a good thing right you can't

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,159
you don't have to take full

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
responsibility for creating

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
misinformation with technology because

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
it's always been around people have lied

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,319
since the beginning of time you know the

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,159
person standing in this you know running

116
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
a stall in athens says to the customer

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
that the person next to him is going to

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
cheat him and their bread is better

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
however did technology make

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
misinformation much much worse yes there

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
is a burden on technologists

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
on programmers on people who increase

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
the spread

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,840
unfortunately this is a problem it sucks

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
i know but what can we do

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
let's talk about the types of

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
misinformation let's talk about why

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
technology is not going to solve this

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
stuff it's subtle

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
okay first

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
what you can get is really ah obvious

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
and really bad misinformation this is

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
the stuff that you know sometimes you

134
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
can catch this is stuff everybody pretty

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
much ignores except the true believers

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
in the first place so what you have is

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
something like this

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
the food runs out

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
new york times is accused of normalizing

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,199
cannibalism this was created by sputnik

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
the propaganda piece from russia that is

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
banned in europe i found out this

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
morning when i tried to visit their

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
website i forgot about that uh it has

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,600
been spread by infowars within the us it

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
is weird it's while nobody actually

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880
believes this crap when they read it

148
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
right like almost nobody this is the

149
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
easy stuff here's another one

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
joe biden obviously did not resign from

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
the white house this was spread on

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
facebook it was uh published by

153
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
politifact

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
third one

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
public health of scotland will no longer

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
publish covet 19 data because somehow

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
it spreads

158
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
aids i i

159
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
again this is just random right

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
this is coming out and so

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
this stuff isn't what we have to worry

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
about

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
when we talk about misinformation and

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
fact checking in general this stuff is

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
easy this stuff is you know whatever you

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
can dismiss this it's all mostly spread

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,440
on fringe organizations anyways

168
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,479
so

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
that's not a problem

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
this is where we start to get in trouble

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
these are also fairly obvious but

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,919
they're way more dangerous right um

173
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,800
turkish observers us and eu hindering

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
russia turkey efforts to solve food

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
crisis and mediate peace this is also

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
from sputnik this is trying to actively

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
screw stuff up

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
right this is trying to actively mess

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
with peace processes with food this is

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
going to actively hurt a ton of

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
people in africa sorry i use profanity a

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
lot

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
um

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,198
 thank you

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,880
all right this is another one this is

186
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
actively spreading

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,960
lgbt uh hate across the u.s this came

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
from

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
i it was uh

190
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
i forget exactly what publication but it

191
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,440
was a fairly well-known one in the us on

192
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
the far right

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
and

194
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
this is you know obviously on the face

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,400
of it you're gonna look at and be like

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
that's insane sure but it sounds like it

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,039
could be real

198
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,800
this is another one

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
in the same vein this is from full fact

200
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
in the uk

201
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
and then we get to the really tough

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
stuff this is the this is the place

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
where people don't realize why

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,960
misinformation is so hard for computers

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
to understand this is the subtle stuff

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
this is the stuff that sounds convincing

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,599
politicians are professional obfuscators

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
that is their job when they get up on

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
stage when a newspaper publishes their

210
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
job is to make everyone in the audience

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
believe they heard what they wanted to

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,599
hear

213
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
right and so oft when it comes down to

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
this sort of stuff there's different

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
ways of looking at it in the first place

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
and then people will believe it a little

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
bit and that's where you get into danger

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
so for instance

219
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
social media posts make unsupported

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,599
claims about zilinski's income and net

221
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
worth

222
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
this is trying to discredit

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
the entire ukrainian attack right this

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
is trying to subtly make people a little

225
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
less sure that they should be supporting

226
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
one side or the other

227
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,879
same here

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,840
this

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
was published i actually before i saw

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
the fact check i heard multiple very

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,958
smart people i know discuss this exact

232
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,519
piece of misinformation

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,279
as a way to show how subtle and smart

234
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,200
you know putin is by releasing this and

235
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
showing he's siding uh with pakistan

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
right

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
unfor you even see it says rt whoever

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
made this is good of course this isn't

239
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,240
true

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
uh somebody fact check this the original

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,720
image if you do a basic reverse image

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
search is it's putin on a

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
massive video call with like 30

244
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
ministers or something like that but

245
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
whoever released this was trying to push

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
a very specific agenda by making

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
something seem convincing it's not

248
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
aliens take over the world it's russia's

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
aligning itself with very specific parts

250
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
of the world

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
and this is another one this is from

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
nigeria

253
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,519
every hour 50 people die as a result of

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,120
diseases related to poor toilet hygiene

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
the sad part is it's actually worse it's

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
actually 61.

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
um and so they're even underplaying it

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,200
and this is

259
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
the really important fact thing that i

260
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,518
want to get to

261
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
the point of misinformation in general

262
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
and this is why technology is not going

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
to solve it

264
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
is that

265
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
it is to convince you to trust nothing

266
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
it's not to convince you of a single

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
individual fact it's not to convince

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
anybody in this audience that a very

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
specific conspiracy theory is correct it

270
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,680
is to barrage you to inundate you over

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
and over

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,079
and over and over and over with more and

273
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
more stuff until you are so sick of it

274
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
you don't care anymore

275
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
and everybody in this audience is

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
susceptible to this right it's not going

277
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
to just be

278
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
your parents your grandparents your

279
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,240
cousins etc it is everyone i feel it's

280
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
to promote apathy and benign neglect

281
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,160
like i don't care anymore screw it and

282
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,519
that's why

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
subtle just taking down and

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
fact-checking individual things is

285
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
really

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
it's it's a band-aid but it's not

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,640
it's not gonna you know it's not a

288
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
suture

289
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
and so

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
you really really have to think about it

291
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
this way it's like i can i can write an

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
algorithm they'll fact-check this one

293
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
piece of information

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
great

295
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
that is not the problem thanks and it's

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
probably only going to be for a very

297
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,079
specific

298
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,519
silo a very specific type of topic that

299
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
you can write an algorithm for general

300
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,040
intelligence is not coming along right

301
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,519
so let's do something and take a look at

302
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
the current stat structure of fact

303
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
checking this sort of whack-a-mole

304
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
i want to say first this is important as

305
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,920
i said it is a bandage it's it's going

306
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,279
to stem

307
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,920
some blood but it's not going to stop

308
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200
it's not going to stop it in the long

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
run

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
however

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
i'm not even sure you can fix it right

312
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,640
i'm not even sure that this problem is

313
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
fixable but maybe we can

314
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
drop it down just

315
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
just a little right

316
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
okay

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
so here's uh one fact check and this is

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,600
this is one of the big problems that you

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
get when you do this sort of thing

320
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
fact checkers are pedantic

321
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
they like to be very specific which

322
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
computers are very good at too the

323
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
problem is you can miss context now

324
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
these people are my really good friends

325
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
they're full fact in the uk they're one

326
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
of the best fact checkers in the world

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
however

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
they fall into this trap as well sure

329
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
the picture wasn't from davos 22 as it

330
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
claimed

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
and davos isn't technically a climate

332
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
change conference however

333
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
the point is that they're all still that

334
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,959
everyone's still flying private planes

335
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
all the way over which is ridiculous

336
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
right and

337
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
davos isn't technically a climate change

338
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
uh conference but it comes up it comes

339
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
up at these meetings so

340
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
is this context explored in the story

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
yes but is are people gonna scroll past

342
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
this probably not

343
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
here's another one

344
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
uh ted cruz says some stuff about james

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
comey

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,360
uh that obama you know appointed him

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,959
right

348
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
but that he couldn't

349
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
that anything this is uh

350
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
factcheck.org in the u.s

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
and again they're missing these

352
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
subtleties about what he's trying to get

353
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
at he's trying to seed a little doubt

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
about everything right that james comey

355
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
in the us if you remember the stories

356
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
can't be trusted anymore but they're

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
focusing on the very specific details

358
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
about it and just trying to knock down

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,160
this one fact while ignoring a larger

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
narrative and sometimes they get it

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
right but sometimes they don't here's a

362
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
last one

363
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
because ron desantis opposes any

364
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
background checks on guns

365
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
even for violent criminals

366
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
they rated it mostly false

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
the problem with this is that ron

368
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
desantis is the governor of florida

369
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
uh actually

370
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,079
it's pretty much true because he

371
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
supports a constitutional amendment that

372
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,240
would remove all background checks in

373
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
the u.s so yes

374
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,959
yes he didn't specifically say that he

375
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,480
doesn't support

376
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,079
background checks or that he opposes

377
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,880
them

378
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
but if you look at just a little bit

379
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
further down the path he actually does

380
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
right and so you get this these sorts of

381
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,639
problems

382
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
and i'm running through my slides a

383
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,360
little quick but

384
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,959
i imagine there's going to be a lot of

385
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,440
time for q a so if you guys have

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,079
questions please feel free to uh think

387
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,720
of them and come up to me later okay

388
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
so

389
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,480
hi everyone

390
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
i'm mr happy

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
uh fact checking is you know i've just

392
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
been standing up here talking about fact

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
checking for a long time about

394
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
how it's completely screwed over how

395
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
nothing's going to happen how nothing

396
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
can work so what can we actually do

397
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,959
what can we actually do what can

398
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
technologists in this room what can

399
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
hackers in this room what can academics

400
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,800
in this room what can just really smart

401
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
people which i'm assuming you all are if

402
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,760
you decided to sit in this camp for like

403
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
six days at least and hang out with each

404
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,199
other

405
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,279
what can we all do

406
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,839
well there's a couple options

407
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,760
but my favorite one

408
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,639
is this so i've been working on

409
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
this sort of technology for a while and

410
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,480
not necessarily the tracking but the

411
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
collecting of misinformation and try and

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,800
tracking of the misinformation itself

413
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
we have huge databases all over the

414
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
world

415
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
of pretty much every fact check that's

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
been made since about 2015. uh i have

417
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,000
one

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
google has another they've actually yeah

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
everybody hates on the big companies and

420
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,360
don't get me wrong i will too but google

421
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
has been heavily supportive on this

422
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
and they mostly use it for putting a

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
fact check in like their search results

424
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
but it's a huge database and it covers

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
almost every country in the world where

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,360
a fact check's been published including

427
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,880
you know so you got the indians you got

428
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,360
the brits you got the french etc um

429
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,519
my question though

430
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,320
is instead of just tracking how a single

431
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
piece of misinformation spreads how can

432
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
we track who's making this

433
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,079
um

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,360
there's this really interesting

435
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,639
statistic

436
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,079
from the center for countering digital

437
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,480
hate that came out in 2021 uh in

438
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
february and early march

439
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
they tracked misinformation on twitter

440
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
and facebook and 65 percent of it around

441
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,880
covet vaccines i should say 65 of it was

442
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,800
created by 12 people

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,720
12 total people created 65 percent of

444
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,440
the misinformation around covet the lies

445
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,959
what's this called what they are their

446
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,759
lies around covid

447
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,160
in the world

448
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,240
they tracked they they examined like i

449
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
don't know a million plus posts and on

450
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
facebook it was like 73 twitter was

451
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,519
another ridiculously large number but if

452
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,320
you had

453
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
averaged it out it came to this

454
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
if there's only 12 people doing this

455
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
maybe it's not as big of a problem as we

456
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
think right

457
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
these are people with an agenda these

458
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
are people that are trying to

459
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
specifically put out the information

460
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
to inundate you so they're not

461
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,839
you know just random people making

462
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
up like it seems to me it seems

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,439
sometimes that it feels like

464
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
so what i'm curious is

465
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
are these profiles

466
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,359
actually trackable not just from

467
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
you know when they publish one thing and

468
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
see how that spreads which is important

469
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,359
and a lot of people are working on it

470
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
myself included

471
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,720
however

472
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
i want to see who's make i want to see

473
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,799
what sort of influence a single account

474
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,200
a single maybe person

475
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
has on the wider infrastructure we need

476
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
to think bigger than the individual

477
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
pieces of lies and that's something that

478
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
people are struggling with

479
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
because

480
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,440
it's hard

481
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
this is hard stuff who has anybody in

482
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
here ever tried to just

483
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,960
like drink from the twitter firehose

484
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
anybody

485
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
yeah no nobody

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
okay so if you ever have i mean i'm

487
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
talking back in like 2010

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,559
was the last time i tried it because it

489
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,960
was so much it's just a shot of water to

490
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
your face like a fire hose it's

491
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
literally called a fire hose and you

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
will be pushed up against the wall

493
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
there's so much data coming through

494
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
every single second that is literally

495
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
impossible for a normal researcher to

496
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
manage so you work on small data sets

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
that is a problem

498
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,679
um because we need to figure out how we

499
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
can more quickly analyze these things

500
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
maybe not store them

501
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,799
but really start looking into stuff

502
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,600
so

503
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
a couple of the other problems that

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
you're going to be finding

505
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,080
what is even misinformation to a

506
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
computer

507
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
um context is important

508
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
if a politician stands up in the middle

509
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
of the day and says the horrible thing

510
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
that the horrible tragedy that happened

511
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
this morning

512
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,799
okay what's a tragedy what's this

513
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
morning who's he talking to where is he

514
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
at this this can all be wildly different

515
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
right there could have been a train

516
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
train collapse in barcelona and also a

517
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
wildfire in california he's probably

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,400
talking about the

519
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,520
train

520
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
if he's in europe he's probably talking

521
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,559
about the wildfire if he's on the west

522
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,559
coast of the u.s

523
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,080
but computers not going to be able to

524
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,679
tell these subtle differences right the

525
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
audience you guys are fine computers

526
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
can't figure this out ai is terrible at

527
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,480
this

528
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,039
you know what is a tragedy

529
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
i don't know i mean it depends right the

530
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
definition is very fungible to a lot of

531
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
people to everybody in this room you

532
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
probably have a slightly different

533
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,559
definition

534
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
and then you get to

535
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,679
the biggest problem that i've been

536
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,200
working on which is

537
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,799
matching claims to something you've seen

538
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
before so you can start comparing and

539
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,840
tracking that right because especially

540
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,640
well english is my expertise but i know

541
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
in this is true in pretty much every

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
language in the world

543
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,000
is that you

544
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,640
a piece of information can be reworded

545
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,960
and restated in a totally different set

546
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
of vocabulary

547
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,280
right so

548
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,799
so someone can completely switch it

549
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
around completely change the words and

550
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
now you're you know if you're doing a

551
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
word embedding model

552
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
you're pretty much screwed at that point

553
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
because yeah maybe a couple percentages

554
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
off can infer some stuff but as soon as

555
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,559
word defect gets a completely different

556
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,640
sentence it's going to start going

557
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
utterly sideways gpt3 if anybody wants

558
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
to ask about that is not good at this

559
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
it's actually terrible at this because

560
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
it doesn't actually reason it just looks

561
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,640
at huge typical models

562
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,520
and

563
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
when you get to the next point which is

564
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
recognizing new claims you haven't seen

565
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
it completely fails

566
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,559
pretty much everything completely fails

567
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
because you can't tell if something's a

568
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
lie automatically

569
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
it's not just statistics right it's

570
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
people

571
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
saying you know various restate

572
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
restating

573
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
reasons for a war 300 years ago

574
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
so

575
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
that's going to be the biggest struggle

576
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
that we're running into

577
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
if we can even get to the continent

578
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
in the first place because private

579
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
groups are screwing

580
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
all of this up for us

581
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
i love encryption encryption is awesome

582
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
it really makes it hard to try to figure

583
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
out who is saying what and where and

584
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
when

585
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
so you have small whatsapp groups or

586
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
large whatsapp groups that

587
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
that uh have very specific membership

588
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
requirements signal is the problem here

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,919
um telegram a little less so because

590
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,280
it's a little bit easier oh that's

591
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,600
billowing um

592
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
but

593
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
trying to get into these where the

594
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
pieces of misinformation

595
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
my theory is are often uh created and

596
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
you know sort of

597
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
battle tested before they get spread to

598
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,200
the wider community is

599
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
an incredibly difficult prospect um

600
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
one that

601
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
the companies don't really want to work

602
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
on because that is not in their benefit

603
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
right people should be able to talk

604
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,919
privately i agree completely i'm in a

605
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,880
bunch of signal groups i mean

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
heck the uh

607
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
camp that i'm here with all started as a

608
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
private signal group we won't let

609
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,480
anybody in but

610
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,039
it's an ethical dilemma feel free to ask

611
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,159
a question about that if you want to

612
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,520
talk about it a little bit more find me

613
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
later

614
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
but

615
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
do we you know at what point is

616
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
misinformation worth invading privacy

617
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
i don't know i don't there's a lot of

618
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,960
people in here i imagine would say never

619
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,919
um

620
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,200
but i'd ask you to think about that for

621
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,919
about three seconds longer and just sort

622
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
of roll it around in your head

623
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
okay so

624
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
why do we even want to do this though

625
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
what's the purpose what's the point if

626
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,440
we're never going to change anything

627
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
anyways what is the point of all of this

628
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,360
what is the point of trying to write

629
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
algorithms to track this what is the

630
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
point of trying to figure out who is

631
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
saying what

632
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,360
well

633
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,880
it's really standard journalism

634
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
questions it's who's making it

635
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
who is doing this

636
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
who's paying for it which is often you

637
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
know the most important follow the money

638
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
why

639
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,480
are they doing this what is their

640
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,799
purpose are they trying to discredit

641
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,360
somebody are they trying to just throw

642
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,159
chaos like a lot of reports have shown

643
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,200
that

644
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
again i'm american so i'm going to speak

645
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,400
to this i apologize i know this is

646
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
mostly european audience and i hate it

647
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,520
when american speakers use nothing but

648
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
american context it

649
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
drives me absolutely insane but i'll

650
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,799
just use this one actually no it works

651
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,320
for brexit too so uh chinese

652
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
the chinese that it was found out

653
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
i was talking to a researcher just a

654
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,679
couple days ago

655
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,840
didn't support one candidate or another

656
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
they didn't support one person or

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
another in fact they supported both

658
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
sides they ran campaigns to have them

659
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
fight each other i mean russia did this

660
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
too they had they would set up counter

661
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
surveillance or not counter protest

662
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
against a protest they had also seated

663
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,760
and set up this is this isn't my water

664
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
bottle's annoying me i'm sorry guys um

665
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
uh they they would set up a protest and

666
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,279
set up a counter protest and then watch

667
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,520
each other them fight each other the

668
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
point that point was just to show

669
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
discord it wasn't to do anything it was

670
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,918
just just throw a wrench in it

671
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,960
and can't and that is a huge problem so

672
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,320
when it comes to this can we cut off

673
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,279
this head can we stop these people

674
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,279
ahead of time can we

675
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,600
censorship is another touchy subject but

676
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,240
can we sort of proactively censor these

677
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
people after

678
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
again after they've been doing a lot of

679
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
things but before they

680
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,960
really build up the momentum and start

681
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
huge massive campaigns this is going to

682
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
be a problem

683
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
right they start small and then they

684
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
gain credibility they gain traction they

685
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
gain followers and then it's so big that

686
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
the major social media companies start

687
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,240
asking questions on whether or not they

688
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
should be taking down in the first place

689
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
this is

690
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
this is a struggle so can we cut this

691
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,480
off can we stop this at the source

692
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
so my idea and i want help with this

693
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,200
please help me please

694
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,039
please talk to me if you want to work on

695
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,120
this is can we fingerprint these fact

696
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
check these

697
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
uh misinformation and lie creators

698
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,880
is there a way that we can come up with

699
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
a system that looks at the vocabulary

700
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,200
the style etc and finds deeper patterns

701
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
so that when we get a new piece of

702
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,159
content

703
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,120
or

704
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
even we can look at it historically

705
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,880
know that at least they're probably

706
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
created by the same people we might not

707
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,520
know who they are

708
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,120
we probably won't know who they are for

709
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
a while but if we can start grouping

710
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,799
pieces of misinformation it's important

711
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,480
so we want to identify the new actor

712
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
early as i mentioned

713
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
and

714
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
then we can start looking back at

715
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
historical

716
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,240
records and information and see

717
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,400
where we went wrong in the past right we

718
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
can learn from our mistakes we can

719
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,200
better insulate ourselves

720
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
we can

721
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
you know do a mea culpa everybody screws

722
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,120
up but let's see what they tried to do

723
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,960
before and let's see what we can do now

724
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
okay this will also help us detect new

725
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
trends

726
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,880
i hope

727
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,159
because new

728
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,720
topics come up you know every fifth day

729
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
there's there's some new

730
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
storyline they're trying out and they'll

731
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,240
they're going to try it out in small

732
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,600
groups first they're going to try and

733
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
see if it if it sort of bleeds out a

734
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
little bit but if we can see that early

735
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
then we can start

736
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,799
counteracting it even earlier and you

737
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,799
know maybe that's not important for some

738
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,520
of the big obvious lies but if the lie

739
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
is instead around i don't know is russia

740
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
going to invade ukraine

741
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,799
i'm wondering if we could have detected

742
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,039
that in you know november a little bit

743
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
better

744
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
are these big

745
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,159
questions are these big ops

746
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,240
easier to find

747
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
so let's

748
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
i don't know i think there might be a

749
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
machine learning algorithm

750
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
methodology to this that can find a

751
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,559
deeper hidden pattern

752
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,520
we'll see

753
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,120
i'm not i i

754
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
i want to try i want to try everything i

755
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
want to throw the kitchen everything but

756
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,679
the kitchen sink at this and if anybody

757
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,760
out there wants to help i would very

758
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
much appreciate that

759
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,600
okay

760
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
there we go

761
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,640
anyways um

762
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,399
as i said i talked a little bit quick at

763
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
the beginning so i sort of finished this

764
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
up a little early but thank you for

765
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
hearing me out um this is a really

766
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,240
important topic this is a really complex

767
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,440
topic for a lot of people to try to

768
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
understand and i'm sorry if i did uh not

769
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
the best job at it i think i tried

770
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
um please

771
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
try to understand where we're coming

772
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,600
from

773
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,360
recognize it yourself talk to people

774
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,840
about this explain you know it's not

775
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,320
just that single lie it is way bigger

776
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,440
than that

777
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
and let's try to build some tools to

778
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
actually make this better this is my

779
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
contact info i'm not going to put my

780
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,640
phone number up there like i usually do

781
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,159
because i don't want weird people

782
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,320
calling me um but if you have any

783
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,480
questions i'm here to answer them it can

784
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,240
be about this fact checking if you're

785
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,159
curious in general journalism the

786
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,919
computer science behind it

787
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,679
um

788
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,230
whatever you want thank you guys

789
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:25,440
[Applause]

790
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
thank you christopher so if you have

791
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
questions please line up behind these

792
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
microphones you probably know the drill

793
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,120
now that's the first question

794
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
thank you hi chris

795
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
the thing you said at the end reminds me

796
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,960
of something called the attack framework

797
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,159
from metra

798
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,559
which is related to exploits and apt

799
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,799
groups and it's both a framework for

800
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,559
categorizing the methods they use but

801
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,480
also naming them and which groups you

802
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
use which methods so maybe you could do

803
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
like a parallel for that and if somebody

804
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
knows of a parallel for that for your

805
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
users then please say so yeah that's um

806
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,000
wow that's yeah absolutely um i i think

807
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,679
i've heard about that program and it

808
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,360
definitely was part of

809
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
the inspiration for this sort of idea of

810
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
like how can

811
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
in my notes i didn't bring it up but

812
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,640
like can we create a cve program

813
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
basically for misinformation and

814
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
spreaders of it yeah thank you for that

815
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,039
i'd love to talk later

816
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,320
from the

817
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
behind microphone

818
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,840
hey chris nice talk uh you should be

819
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
swearing more this is not u.s television

820
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
here uh sorry about that god

821
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
damn

822
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
um there was one aspect i was slightly

823
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,080
missing that is um i understand that

824
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
some people just want to see the world

825
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,960
burn i get that yeah but many do it for

826
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
for fun and profit

827
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,279
um

828
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,399
if i look at

829
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,279
people from alex jones up to um

830
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
zuckerberg they make money with that

831
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,159
isn't draining the swamp also a strategy

832
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,679
absolutely yeah there are a lot of

833
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,720
people funding a lot of this um

834
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,440
however they're in my experience they're

835
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
not the ones actually creating a lot of

836
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,080
the initial push for the pro for the

837
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
misinformation for the lies as i showed

838
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,039
earlier there's that uh story that was

839
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,399
on infowars but it was originally

840
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,880
published by sputnik so the russians the

841
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
russian propaganda department actually

842
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
had something to do with that and then

843
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,039
it was spread in these more local

844
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,840
organizations

845
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,720
oh hello speaking of the russians uh

846
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
i noticed from my personal experience

847
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,480
that

848
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,559
when the invasion of ukraine began

849
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,799
the amount of disinformation that we

850
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
were seeing on other topics

851
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,559
disappeared

852
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,520
and

853
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,720
we saw a new influx of different types

854
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,000
is is that something that's modelable

855
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,159
and trackable

856
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
you know that's what i i think it is

857
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,320
that that's the thing so like if we can

858
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,760
fingerprint these creators that

859
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,840
fingerprint

860
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,240
will i hope spread across from content

861
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,519
topics right so it's more than just

862
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,000
it would be fascinating to see who

863
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,720
switched their uh misinformation

864
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
creation from one topic to another at

865
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,399
that exact moment that would be

866
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
absolutely amazing and really indicting

867
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,640
against you against uh you know the

868
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,559
whole organizations and such thing

869
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,000
thanks

870
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,120
so um please use both microphones

871
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
well the next person or the first

872
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
microphone please

873
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,159
hey chris thanks for your talk yeah

874
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
really important stuff so

875
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,279
what do you think could be a role for

876
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
legislators in this could you make laws

877
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
or something that that helps us in this

878
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,120
quest for banning misinformation

879
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
yeah um why did i get a stick mic all of

880
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,360
a sudden

881
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,799
okay

882
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
can you hear me everyone can remember

883
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,840
okay cool

884
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,279
um you know that's gonna that's that's

885
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,760
interesting because as an american

886
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,919
our standards of free speech are very

887
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,080
different than in a lot of europe um i

888
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,519
mean you know substantially they're

889
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,519
quite similar but there's various very

890
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,840
very interesting uh specifics that are

891
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,039
very different and so

892
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,880
how what how do you do that what is

893
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
what is misinformation there's so much

894
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
you can never say that everything's a

895
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,799
lie right like you can never

896
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,240
it's going to end up filling up the

897
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
court system so much um do you

898
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,960
how do you punish somebody first you

899
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,760
know

900
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,279
accidentally say something that was

901
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,039
wrong yeah right but there there must be

902
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,120
some role for legislators in here for

903
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
like maybe big money ban big money in in

904
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,039
on on twitter accounts or something like

905
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,919
that there must be some way we can help

906
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,159
there right you think maybe we'll talk

907
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,559
after but yeah let's talk after because

908
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,000
i need i need to roll that around in my

909
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
head for a second yeah please um the

910
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,559
other microphone first please uh but

911
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,000
yeah i was first

912
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
yeah okay then the first microphone

913
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
first

914
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,399
hello uh so i find it interesting that

915
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,960
you focus on identifying the original

916
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,760
sources of misinformation the the and

917
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,919
especially in your response to the uh

918
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
when you talked about alex jones and how

919
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,399
he doesn't create this misinformation he

920
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,399
just takes it you know and then um

921
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,679
yeah so

922
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,760
uh i find it interesting that you focus

923
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,039
on

924
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,360
uh the original creators quote unquote

925
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
instead of those who amplify

926
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
uh the um the spread of of

927
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,640
misinformation because for me it is uh

928
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
you said that it's difficult to get into

929
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
those you know closed groups and and and

930
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,840
all sorts of things it's difficult to

931
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,080
identify those um those original

932
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,120
creators

933
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
but on the other hand it is quite easy

934
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,039
to identify those who

935
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
pump up and amplify right so why not

936
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
attack the problem here and at the

937
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
amplification level right when this

938
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,360
actually becomes a problem when this

939
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
actually gets spread to millions of

940
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,360
views

941
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,440
instead of trying to find the uh

942
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,919
original creators sure um because that's

943
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,120
being done

944
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
i want to think bigger i want to that

945
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
nobody's really looking at this question

946
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,519
for the most part i want to go deeper

947
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,119
there's a lot of people including at

948
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,719
these major organizations who by the way

949
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,520
know

950
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,040
who these people are they could take

951
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,239
them out tomorrow but they're not going

952
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,079
to take alex jones off because he has

953
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,119
you know five whatever billion followers

954
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,480
um

955
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,839
but yeah i wanna i wanna i this is a

956
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,199
different problem

957
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,359
that i'm trying to focus on uh not just

958
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,760
the spreaders but i wanna know

959
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
who is behind it you know but you know

960
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,159
investigate like investigative reporting

961
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,679
you want to go as deep as you possibly

962
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,440
can and then build it up from there

963
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,359
thank you

964
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,199
other microphone please

965
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,480
yeah thank you

966
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
um

967
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
yeah fake news and propaganda has been

968
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,760
around as long as humanity is around

969
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,560
that

970
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
in your presentation you mentioned that

971
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
technology is amplifying this but

972
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,599
shouldn't you say

973
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
surveillance capitalism is what's doing

974
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
the amplification and not technology

975
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,839
itself

976
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,400
could you expand a little bit more on

977
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,960
why how surveillance capitalism would be

978
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
causing them

979
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,680
by optimizing all the algorithms for

980
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
attention and polarization because if

981
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,079
you push around fake news people in

982
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
clickbait people keep clicking or sure

983
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,760
so yeah so that definitely doesn't help

984
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,800
at all

985
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,359
that is def that makes it much worse

986
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,599
but also the fact that you can spread

987
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,200
information instantly anywhere in the

988
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,119
world even before it's amplified by some

989
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,960
crappy algorithm shitty algorithm sorry

990
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,740
i should swear more um

991
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,839
[Music]

992
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,800
is

993
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,680
is re is one of the big causes right

994
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
without the internet you couldn't

995
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
amplify it in the first place the fact

996
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
that sputnik can post something and i

997
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,079
can read it in brooklyn new york means

998
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,119
that

999
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,680
that is way more con that is way more

1000
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,200
likely to spread in general if i was

1001
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
living in brooklyn new york in 1975 i

1002
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
could not get a copy of pravda right

1003
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,280
okay but the likelihood that you're

1004
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,520
reading it that's caused by

1005
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
by this algorithms that are pumping this

1006
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
around not disagreeing there at all that

1007
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
is absolute that is absolutely true um

1008
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
like i said

1009
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,079
it made it technology made the whole

1010
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
thing much much worse that is that

1011
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,839
that's that those are part of that

1012
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,160
technology is technology part of the

1013
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
social and you know

1014
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,760
economic system yes

1015
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,880
um

1016
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,760
but

1017
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
you know at some point i i could have

1018
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
gone you know if i wanted to do just a

1019
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,160
lecture on the economics of this that's

1020
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,440
a whole different thing

1021
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,160
okay

1022
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,200
next question please

1023
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,640
so

1024
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,720
i had an immediate uncomfortable gut

1025
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
reaction when you started talking about

1026
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,960
building a tool to track down who said a

1027
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,359
thing yeah and maybe you could reassure

1028
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,800
us a little bit about why you're not

1029
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,880
creating a scary tool that bad people

1030
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,680
will use to go after activists

1031
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
absolutely true because i'm a good guy

1032
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,200
um

1033
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
yeah right that's what we all tell

1034
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,760
ourselves

1035
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200
it's how i sleep at night um

1036
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
the bad guys probably have a lot of this

1037
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
already they're just not letting anybody

1038
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,440
know

1039
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
um that's

1040
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,000
that's right fall on that um

1041
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
it's a really good question and it's an

1042
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
ethical question that we needed that we

1043
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,960
would need to discuss um

1044
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,920
at some point every technology you know

1045
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,960
technology is neutral can be it can be

1046
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,720
can be good and it can be bad there is

1047
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,240
no neutral technology and only bad users

1048
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
and that's a good point it's

1049
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
something that we do really need to

1050
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,839
discuss

1051
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,078
but at one point what point is

1052
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,760
do we just throw our hands up then and

1053
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,280
say well they could do whatever they

1054
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,520
want because we'll never find them

1055
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,599
i don't know like where where what's the

1056
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
trade-off here

1057
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
okay aaron needs going to follow up on

1058
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
that real quickly

1059
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
i guess one of the

1060
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
one of the reasons i sat down and didn't

1061
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,520
ask the question the first time is i

1062
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
thought to myself well most of the

1063
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,720
people that are trying to make the world

1064
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
better are not particularly ashamed of

1065
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,119
it

1066
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,400
so i guess it would be interesting to

1067
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,560
focus on what kind of activism needs

1068
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
that kind of anonymity and whether you

1069
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,520
would be putting them at risk right

1070
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
but it's worth thinking about

1071
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,040
absolutely and um let's have a beer and

1072
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
talk that over a lot more

1073
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,880
yes you can

1074
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
do probably a lot of more questions

1075
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,920
after the talk with a group of people

1076
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,119
so going deep into the questions next

1077
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,720
from the cyber guy

1078
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,520
oh

1079
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
hi i'm cyber guy um

1080
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,680
okay two things uh very quickly first

1081
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,000
your premise is a technology will not

1082
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
solve the problem but i happen to know

1083
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,359
that you've been developing some

1084
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,000
technology to help solve the problem and

1085
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,079
i'd like you to tell us a little bit

1086
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,400
more about what exactly that is second

1087
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
thing um

1088
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,440
we know that there are fact checking

1089
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
websites out there but most people don't

1090
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,520
visit them and so most people will never

1091
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
see a fact check and uh so can you talk

1092
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,119
a little bit about how uh what kind of

1093
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,040
strategies we can employ

1094
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,079
to

1095
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,359
improve

1096
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,599
the general public's ability to defend

1097
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
themselves against misinformation to

1098
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,119
understand the context and nuances of

1099
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
what's going on thanks yeah thank you uh

1100
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
those are great things um

1101
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,240
thanks for you know asking me to promote

1102
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,560
myself a little um

1103
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,960
so the big the so at the duke reporter's

1104
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
lab the big thing that i've worked on

1105
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
over a number of years which is

1106
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,720
not a failure but it's definitely not

1107
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,320
good enough what is automated fact

1108
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
checking so i said that you can't

1109
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,920
automate fact checking and i know that

1110
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,000
because i've tried a lot

1111
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
um

1112
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,800
the big thing that we built is the

1113
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
product called squash i did not name it

1114
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,280
my boss did because you squash bugs i

1115
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
guess um

1116
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,000
the

1117
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,359
code base is called something very

1118
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,680
different but uh basically you can

1119
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,440
listen to um it listens to speeches by

1120
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
politicians debates etc automatically

1121
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,960
transcribes it all and then uh runs it

1122
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
through another system created by a

1123
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
group at the university of texas at

1124
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,319
arlington that can detect fact-checkable

1125
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,920
claims from something which is harder

1126
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
than you really think it's way harder

1127
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
than you think uh but it's really good

1128
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,680
at it especially for american political

1129
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,720
speech

1130
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,880
there's another group in argentina

1131
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,040
that's written something uh there called

1132
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,800
checkiado that does something very very

1133
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
similar and is excellent in spanish

1134
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
especially argentinian spanish although

1135
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,119
they worked with spain too on the uk

1136
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,880
folfact did something similar too and

1137
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,560
then so you get the full

1138
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,520
claim

1139
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
and then you try that clay matching you

1140
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,359
try to figure out if somebody else has

1141
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,280
checked this before

1142
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,000
and then show that to straight over the

1143
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,119
video

1144
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,599
sounds awesome the problem is we're only

1145
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,000
at about 50 60 percent of accuracy when

1146
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,359
it comes to claim matching and because

1147
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,040
the topics change so frequently it's

1148
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,640
really hard to build up enough of a data

1149
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,520
set around a specific claim from a very

1150
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
specific race

1151
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
uh the other thing that i'm working on

1152
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,359
right now is an archive of fact-checked

1153
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,000
media one of the big that's what's gonna

1154
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,040
hap help i hope with the tracing is that

1155
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
right now when some a piece of social

1156
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
media is fact checked that video image

1157
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
audio is taken down pretty quickly

1158
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
hopefully that's sort of the goal the

1159
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
problem is then we have this structured

1160
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
data that is completely meaningless

1161
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,400
because you don't actually have the

1162
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
image it was fact checking or the meme

1163
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,760
or the video or what have you and so

1164
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,280
we're building

1165
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,319
a entire archive that lets you that will

1166
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,920
automatically download all this the

1167
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,200
moment the fact check is created

1168
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,960
hopefully before the platforms take it

1169
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,119
down and then that's searchable that's

1170
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,880
reverse image switchable reverse video

1171
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,560
searchable text ocr etc

1172
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,839
and with that

1173
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,680
i'm we're building up this huge data set

1174
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,359
that i'm hoping we can start

1175
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,400
looking at for this finger check

1176
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,720
when it comes to

1177
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,480
how do we get people to

1178
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,880
read fact checks

1179
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,359
good god if you could figure that out i

1180
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,720
have a lot of grant money for you um

1181
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,079
the problem that is the big problem you

1182
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,839
end up with a preaching to the choir

1183
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,920
issue basically nobody would go to a

1184
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,319
fact check website that doesn't alright

1185
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,800
that isn't already you know

1186
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
agreeing mostly you know with the fact

1187
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,319
that proof

1188
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,480
can't that there can be

1189
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,400
truth that people lie

1190
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
and so you sort of have to reach them

1191
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,599
where they are

1192
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,520
one of the big things is

1193
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,599
uh google putting search res uh fact

1194
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
checks directly in search results has

1195
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
been really useful

1196
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,760
um facebook yes they've done something

1197
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,480
good uh they have the fact check

1198
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
insights program where fact checker they

1199
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,920
pay fact checkers to fact check stuff

1200
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,680
that has been reported and when that's

1201
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,720
done

1202
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
it everybody that ever shared it

1203
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
gets a notification with a link to that

1204
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,960
article that checks uh what was said

1205
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,800
so every single person that shared it

1206
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
can read it

1207
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
what else can we do it's going to be

1208
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,920
challenging we're thinking about putting

1209
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,640
stuff on like you know petrol station

1210
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,400
tvs

1211
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,720
it's a throw stuff at the wall

1212
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,520
yes

1213
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,880
there are two more questions in the

1214
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,079
audience first the pink t-shirt please

1215
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
yeah um thanks

1216
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,800
i appreciate the thought to identify

1217
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
the actors behind that especially when

1218
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
there is a very small group

1219
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,400
but i have to admit

1220
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,359
out of curiosity because i can't see the

1221
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,800
effect if these actors are known because

1222
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,119
in my impression is it doesn't make a

1223
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,720
difference for anyone spreading

1224
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,319
misinformation

1225
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,720
what the sources um if i know hey that's

1226
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,440
russian propaganda they don't care they

1227
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,319
spread it anyways what's the

1228
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,119
benefit of knowing these actors

1229
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
so it's

1230
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
it's good just to let people know people

1231
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
should be at least be able to know right

1232
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,000
what who created what they're reading

1233
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,599
but also this is important for policy

1234
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,000
this is not just for the individual user

1235
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,119
it's

1236
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,640
going back to the legislation question

1237
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,319
this is good for policy

1238
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,079
makers to understand where this is

1239
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,000
coming from that what they're spouting

1240
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,400
the facts or the you know statistics and

1241
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,000
misinformation they're repeating often

1242
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,119
on

1243
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,160
you know in parliament buildings uh is

1244
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,040
wrong and where it came from they

1245
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,800
if we're talking about censorship that

1246
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,079
is somewhere where you can start we

1247
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,359
can't start if we don't have the

1248
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,960
information about where who's creating

1249
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,880
it in the first place right so it's

1250
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,119
really a bigger policy it's bigger

1251
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,119
technical thing it's it's bigger for

1252
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,960
it's bigger than just to the individual

1253
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,720
user

1254
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,520
the other microphone please

1255
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,640
yes one question about

1256
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
outright lies evolving in somewhat

1257
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,520
plausible theories that reach mainstream

1258
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,760
or reputable media

1259
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,079
i'm trans this is my topic i follow and

1260
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,000
they see that a lot with transphobic

1261
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,319
talk that started as outright obvious

1262
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,359
lies

1263
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,160
but

1264
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,400
certainly evolved into the gender

1265
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,160
critical movement as they call

1266
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,160
themselves

1267
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,960
so what do you do about that um

1268
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,160
well

1269
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,240
as you said they started somewhere and

1270
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,400
so i'm hoping we can find where they

1271
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
start before they start evolving and

1272
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,400
moving right it's it's like um trying to

1273
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
catch a invasive species at

1274
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,520
when it's you know rolling off the

1275
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,119
ship at the docks

1276
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,280
rather than scouring the forest for it

1277
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,440
um

1278
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
what you can do after the cat's out of

1279
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,880
the bag that's a really tough question

1280
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
um it's something that i've been

1281
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,960
struggling with for a long time and

1282
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,400
there's so many topics where this has

1283
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,560
happened right um

1284
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,319
flat earth pizzagate etc in the u.s and

1285
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
it's just becomes really really

1286
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,839
challenging at that point but that's why

1287
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,240
i want to see if we can cut off the head

1288
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
before it grows too big so that we can

1289
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,760
stop those early

1290
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
[Music]

1291
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,480
so

1292
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,800
next question please hi thank you for

1293
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,680
your talk i was wondering um who should

1294
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,079
be trying to identify the head and who

1295
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,400
should be the one trying to cut it off

1296
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,560
um like should it be academics uh

1297
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
journalist doing the research and on

1298
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,480
who's who the heads are should it be

1299
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,240
government i know government is really

1300
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,920
struggling with the question how to deal

1301
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
with mean sofo because you also get into

1302
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,200
the freedom of speech

1303
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,880
but also i don't know i guess government

1304
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,760
should do something right so what are

1305
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,520
your thoughts on on this one

1306
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,359
i mean government should do something

1307
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,280
and um when it comes to cutting off the

1308
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,640
head they're probably the only ones that

1309
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,800
can in a lot of ways them and the big

1310
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,240
platforms of course

1311
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,119
so

1312
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,119
you know it's not the message it's the

1313
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,599
media right so who can

1314
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,400
you know who has the ability to stop

1315
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
that spread of those specific people

1316
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,079
when they're or organizations or what

1317
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,920
have you when they're identified um

1318
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,960
that's going to be government that's

1319
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,880
going to be big tech companies that that

1320
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,760
sort of thing um it's definitely

1321
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,000
journalists and academics um hackers

1322
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,880
please for the love of god um

1323
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
should absolutely uh i think should be

1324
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,160
the ones doing the research when

1325
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,920
government starts researching this of

1326
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,160
course they have been right cia mi6

1327
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,520
they've

1328
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,319
gchq nsa they've all been doing this um

1329
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,640
for years i'm sure um but they're not

1330
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
making it public because it doesn't

1331
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,839
benefit them to make it public it

1332
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,480
benefits them internally

1333
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,200
we'll see if anybody hey where's the fed

1334
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
come talk to me um

1335
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
yeah thanks sorry i wish i had better

1336
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,480
answers about the government it's it's

1337
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
tough and it's every country is going to

1338
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,760
be different because every country has

1339
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,200
different laws you know the freedom of

1340
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,880
speech in thailand versus freedom of

1341
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,480
speech in

1342
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
argentina you're going to struggle on

1343
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,160
both sides

1344
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,839
last question please

1345
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:48,640
yes

1346
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,520
so

1347
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,920
i was thinking a bit that for now all

1348
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,040
these measures research is going into

1349
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,520
somehow you know treating this condition

1350
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
that's affecting the public but if you

1351
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,480
you know continue with his analogy maybe

1352
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,520
it's also better to look at the

1353
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,839
let's say immunization of the population

1354
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,920
because maybe there is a fertile

1355
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,480
substrate for misunderst like for this

1356
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,800
kind of discord to spread because as you

1357
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,640
said it seems like the

1358
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,319
real you know

1359
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,480
end game is to actually you know see

1360
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,920
this course between the public uh in

1361
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,480
various you know groups or the old

1362
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,480
public you know of a nation

1363
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,520
or

1364
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,240
and so maybe is actually due of course

1365
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,680
there is no control group for this

1366
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,079
because you know the technology crew

1367
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
with these new problems we're facing

1368
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,480
like climate change economic conditions

1369
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
worsening you know the decline of the

1370
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,319
middle class so maybe

1371
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,480
it's also that we should think about you

1372
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,839
know changing also

1373
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,640
white people are more prone to share and

1374
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,359
fall into this kind of misinformation

1375
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,800
and

1376
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,680
you know

1377
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,000
mistrust towards the

1378
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,760
you know

1379
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,680
government for example

1380
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,720
and

1381
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,040
yeah i don't know it's more of kind of

1382
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,599
an open question yeah absolutely and

1383
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,200
that's something that a lot of people

1384
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
are looking into so you know how do you

1385
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,960
educate the youth how do you

1386
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,200
educate adults uh how do you make them

1387
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
less prone to believing this stuff in

1388
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,079
the first place um

1389
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,640
my usual answer is that's awesome it'll

1390
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,319
solve the best information problem in 20

1391
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,319
years when those kids grow up

1392
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,640
we have a problem now um

1393
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,079
adults

1394
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,839
it's real piecemeal um the group

1395
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,520
politifact who i'm quite good friends

1396
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,599
with in the us have tried this a lot

1397
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,960
they've done they've had a lot of

1398
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,800
success on ver but it's very limited

1399
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
scale by like going to public libraries

1400
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,119
in these small rural towns and literally

1401
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,880
saying basically doing this like ask the

1402
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,160
fact checker

1403
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,000
and

1404
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,079
then surveying and it turns out yeah

1405
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,240
people tend to trust uh the media and

1406
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,720
fact checks more afterwards and trust

1407
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,160
the people that you would normally get

1408
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,839
it from less

1409
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,680
uh the problem is you get like 20 at a

1410
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,480
time

1411
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,079
so what what what are you going to do at

1412
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,640
that point right um we need there's a

1413
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,119
lot of resources if anybody's out there

1414
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,559
international fact checking day is the

1415
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,400
