2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
all righty thank you for the warm

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
welcome and thank you for being out and

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
about at almost 11 o'clock at night this

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
is non-euclidean doom if you are here

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
for euclidean doom you are in the wrong

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
room

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
so to begin with doom

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
classic first person shooter space

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,239
marine fighting invading demons from

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,440
hell

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
released 1993

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
the initial team was only a handful of

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
people john carmack being one of the

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
main folks behind it it was open sourced

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
in 1997 under non-profit license and

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
then open sourced under gpl in 1999 and

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
there's a bunch of ports

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
i'm using chocolate doom which is a port

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
that intends to be

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
very true to the original game and it

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
was shareware initially so you would

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
download it and then you could play it

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
and then if you liked it to buy the full

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,119
game you would send its software some

26
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
money and then you could have the full

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
game

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,640
so this is what it looks like

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,780
[Music]

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
this is what it looks like

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
when pie is just a little off so it

32
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,079
looks mostly fine

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
all right so

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
let's take a very very brief segway to

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
1993.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
the minimum requirements for the game

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,600
was a 386 with four megabytes of ram

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
running a very very small 320 by 200

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
resolution no 3d acceleration and

40
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,479
networking we not tcp it was ipx

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,880
and also in 1993 we had hacking at the

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
end of the universe so the predecessor

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
conference to this conference was also

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
taking place at that time and very very

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,319
brief segway to hacking at the end of

46
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
the universe i just love the description

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
from that conference about there will be

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
a guarded depository for your

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
laptops and valuables and you might get

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
your stuff back

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
and then also

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,360
um

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
you could make payment at the door which

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,720
we don't have

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
now and then very important bring many

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,200
guitars and laptops was for a 1993

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
hacker camp so anyway back to doom

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
so john carmack

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
wrote the networking stack for it and he

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
made a big mistake

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
he thought that only a couple of packets

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
would not cause any problems when people

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
were playing the game networked but it

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
turned out it did so you could actually

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
there were denial of service attacks

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
that were caused inadvertently by people

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
playing doom so you would have a few

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
dozen players that could completely

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
 a network with a few thousand

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
endpoints and then there was a lot of

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,319
network administrators at universities

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,080
that wound up banning doom or

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,519
restricting

74
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,200
it because it would literally take the

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
network down if you are playing the game

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
and the other thing is it runs on

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
everything people have ported doom to

78
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
all sorts of platforms

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
including

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
your badge so

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
runs on doom

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
and sylvain lefebvre did the fpga port

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,319
so it's actually an fpga port of of the

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
game game originally of course was

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
written in c

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
so pi we all know pi the ratio of the

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,159
circumference to the diameter of a

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,760
circle all right well this is going to

89
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
be some crowd crowd interaction here all

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
right one

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
four

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,879
no

93
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
no that's not right

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
but

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
but that's what the original game was

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
compiled with so rather than then then

97
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
four would would be the appropriate

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
digit there it was compiled with seven

99
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,720
and then one person said happy pi day

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
the source code includes an incorrect

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
approximation of pi instead of the

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
correct one i hope someone got fired for

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
that blunder

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
which is very very mean um

105
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
especially again back in 1993 it was not

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
that easy to just go online and get the

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
value and then john himself

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
admitted it he incorrectly recalled

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
the 10th digit of pi

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,759
so

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
john i think we forgive you

112
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
for this mistake

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
it was not noticeable in the game and it

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,759
was left in the source uh incorrect

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,960
um

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
so of course where does pi come up in

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
doom well there are some lookup tables

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
and this is the original source

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,240
um so look up tables do not try to look

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
them up

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
so that's in the original source of doom

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
and then the order of appearance so

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
there's one lookup table for tangents um

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
there is a

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,639
binary

126
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
representation of angles

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
um

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
they're doing some bit shifts everything

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,639
is memory constrained it's 1993. uh

130
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
sign lookups guess what it serves as

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
coastline too because you can just shift

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,440
it

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
remarkable thing is how to use bams with

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
this so

135
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
unanswered comment in the code i guess

136
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
some things don't change since 1993.

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
um and then tan to angle arctan lookup

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
table

139
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
maps the tan of the angle to the angle

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
fast got a search so this is in the

141
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
original source and now you say like

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
well it's

143
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
it's just a lookup table why but why

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
would you do a lookup table for simple

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,759
trigonometry um this is the the initial

146
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
uh values of the lookup table for find

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,080
sign it's it's just a simple

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
trigonometric function why would you

149
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
even do a lookup table well the reason

150
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,319
um for that i'll go ahead into in a

151
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,759
little bit but this is the source for

152
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
example for for calculating the fine

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,319
sine lookup table again

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
very very simple doing some very basic

155
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
operations you know it doesn't really

156
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
seem to make sense why you would need a

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,080
lookup table for just some trigonometry

158
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
but never forget this is why so the game

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
is going to be running on this right so

160
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
no 3d acceleration you're going to be

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
having to make all of those queries

162
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
fast and it turned out that in 1993 the

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,240
way to make those queries fast was to

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
pre-compute a lookup table

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
and then the value of pi is embedded in

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
those lookup tables

167
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,720
so now we're going to get to the fun

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
part we're going to change pi

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,639
um and then we're going to

170
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,080
figure out whether it compiles and

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
whether it plays so first we're going to

172
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
make pi equal to 2 pi

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
okay so does it compile

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
anyone

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
yes

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
does it play

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
no

178
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
um i know

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
not fun all right so now we're gonna

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
make pi equal four does it compile

181
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
yes it does does it play uh also not fun

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
the the hyperbolic values are not very

183
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
very good uh we're going to make pi

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
equal to pi

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
does it compile actual pi not the wrong

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,479
value

187
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
yes it does compile does it play yes it

188
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,599
plays and of course it the game looks

189
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
like normal because it was

190
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
changed at the 10th digit so that's

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
very very far out so

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
you don't really have a difference in

193
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
terms of how it looks but remember how

194
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
this looks because this style of play

195
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
through i'm going to do for

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
the other values so this is what it

197
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
looks like with the correct value of pi

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
everything seems to be

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,639
very logical and makes sense

200
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
now

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
pi is equal to three

202
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,720
does it compile

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,599
yes

204
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,120
does it play

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
yes it does now it gets interesting all

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
right so here is the non-euclidean doom

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
alright

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,599
so

209
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
you can see that in the demo that plays

210
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
in the beginning of the game it's it's

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,319
completely shifted so this is the same

212
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
script that plays in the normal doom but

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
you it winds up killing you because

214
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
because the game isn't expecting that

215
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,440
that dynamic

216
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
now

217
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
we're gonna see what it looks like

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,519
when it pi is equal to three so

219
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,120
you start to see things kind of move

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,599
a little bit

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,240
so things are a little off the walls are

222
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
moving in a way that you do not expect

223
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
and so things start to shift

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,279
right so

225
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
because it's non-euclidean now there's

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
you know a straight line is no longer

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
the shortest path between two points and

228
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
one thing i was curious about is whether

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
whether the the shots would actually be

230
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
straight and weirdly enough the shots

231
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
were straight that's probably because of

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
the the the uh the target detection that

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
they were doing but everything else

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
starts to kind of

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
be a little weird but but it's playable

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,320
with with pi equal to three um and yeah

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,360
so that

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
starts to look kind of interesting now

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
we're going to make pi equal to e

240
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
does it compile yes

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
does it play also yes

242
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
so now it will get a little more

243
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
interesting

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
alright so now

245
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
yeah

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
yeah it's

247
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,200
it's dancing yeah

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
yeah with enough intoxication you can

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,880
recreate this

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
and then the other funny thing that

251
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,240
happens is they disappear if you move or

252
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
they they kind of jump left and right as

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,200
well

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
but it starts to

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
yeah it's really it starts to get really

256
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
funky

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
all right pi over two does it compile

258
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
yes does it play yes it does all right

259
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
it's getting more interesting now

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,480
so

261
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,279
now it starts to just be yeah

262
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
it's uh

263
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,839
it's yeah

264
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,040
um

265
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
a little

266
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
yeah

267
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,880
pretty pretty hard to play at this point

268
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
and then like the wall boundaries start

269
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
are also kind of get in the way um but

270
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
there is there's still collision

271
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
detection here so

272
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
it's not that easy to clip through walls

273
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
even with this kind of rendering

274
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,320
um so yeah this is pi equal to pi over

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
2.

276
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,200
all right pi equals

277
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,120
0.0001 does it compile

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
yes does it play

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
surprisingly it does

280
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
all right

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
that's yeah unfortunately it plays but

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,800
not a very fun game

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
all right

284
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
pi equals zero does it compile

285
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
no that's right it does not

286
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
divide by zero

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
and of course it doesn't play

288
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,319
negative pi

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
it compiles

290
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
unfortunately does not play that one

291
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,519
would have been good

292
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,720
negative one million

293
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
yes it compiles

294
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,160
unfortunately it does not play

295
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,399
so there's the table for the values i

296
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,440
tried

297
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
um i'm curious if there's other

298
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,839
interesting values um for those look up

299
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,120
tables that

300
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
that that could make this game

301
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,319
also kind of interesting

302
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
so if you want to try this yourself you

303
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
can get chocolate doom

304
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,959
you can modify the value of pi right in

305
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
the source

306
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
there's two functions that generate

307
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,639
those lookup tables so they're com

308
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,160
they're normally commented out because

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
those tables are pre-generated so you

310
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
uncomment them then you generate those

311
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,040
three lookup arrays

312
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,399
save those lookup arrays compile there's

313
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,200
a

314
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
builds tool that helps with the

315
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,800
compilation as well then you download a

316
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
map file of your choice so everything

317
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
here i did was on on doom 1 the original

318
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
but you can you can try this on doom 2

319
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,760
and other games and see

320
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
see how it looks

321
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
and enjoy and you could try this

322
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,399
yourself

323
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
so um to end off with i want to go over

324
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
some other projects so one person for

325
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,279
example did ray tracing doom

326
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
so this is making the game look better

327
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,279
so it's the original game but with wayne

328
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,600
tracing this was done by soul team

329
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
this is open source as well if you'd

330
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
like to see this um

331
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,079
ray tracing in a game that's from 1993

332
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,959
is

333
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,839
kind of interesting

334
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,920
jpeg injection this is also really

335
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
really interesting so

336
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
this is a jpeg

337
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
that's 117 kilobytes normal jpeg or it

338
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
looks like a normal jpeg

339
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
normal image you can download it it

340
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
renders fine

341
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
it's jpeg image

342
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,120
but

343
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,160
if you take this jpeg and you save it

344
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
as a doom save file

345
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,279
and then you load it

346
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,480
there's going to be something

347
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
interesting that happens and so this is

348
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
a video of that

349
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,480
that's right

350
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,440
code injection via jpeg that has been

351
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
renamed

352
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,420
[Applause]

353
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,699
[Music]

354
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
all in 117 kilobytes so that was a great

355
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
great project that was done

356
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,160
by keg sws on twitter

357
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
uh there's other non-euclidean games

358
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,959
weirdly enough they all look kind of

359
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,680
similar in terms of kind of spatial

360
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
orientation um so there's a great xena

361
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,279
rogue did a great post

362
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
listing a lot of new games that were

363
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
deliberately made to be non-euclidean

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
if you'd like to to read through them

365
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
there's uh there's a great post there

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
that lists i think there's over 20 at

367
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
this point where they all kind of do

368
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,120
different things with geometry

369
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
there's a fun little tidbit which is so

370
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
now that there's this incorrect value of

371
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,279
pi that was placed in the source code

372
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,040
well like

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
is this value has have other people just

374
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
copied this value thinking it was the

375
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,440
correct value of pi

376
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,959
and used it

377
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,760
and the answer to this question is yes

378
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,959
so

379
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
there and then these most of these are

380
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
not forks of the game so these are just

381
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,440
new projects where someone

382
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
copied this incorrect value enough times

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,839
that there's now 2 000

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,000
code results on github that use the

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
wrong value of pi

386
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
and then on google there's about four

387
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
and a half thousand results

388
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
i don't know how many of them reference

389
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
doom and how many of them are just

390
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
people incorrectly

391
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
copying the value but if you want to

392
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
look through those code results there's

393
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
the github link

394
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,519
and that's all so thank you so much and

395
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,620
happy to take questions

396
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:06,639
[Applause]

397
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,959
i'm left ah we do have some time left so

398
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,560
if you have any questions please line up

399
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
at the microphones

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
and

401
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
feel free to ask them

402
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,279
anyone yes perfect

403
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,560
so we saw some examples of pi being

404
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,639
smaller and still playable are there any

405
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
examples of pi being larger and also

406
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
still playable yeah so the the value

407
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
that john carmack used in the original

408
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,399
game was larger marginally and still

409
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,160
playable um

410
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
uh one thing i'd like to do is do a

411
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,800
search to find the largest playable

412
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
value which would be interesting i

413
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
haven't done that experiment yet but i i

414
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
know it's between the incorrect value

415
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,959
that john used them for because four is

416
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
not playable so it'd be interesting to

417
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
see what the largest playable pi value

418
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,199
is

419
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,880
as for the game

420
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,559
okay thanks

421
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
if you find it tell me

422
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
back microphone please

423
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,000
thanks thanks for your talk it was

424
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
really funny um i was wondering how is

425
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,480
not playable defined like i mean

426
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
obviously the you showed some examples

427
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,319
were also not very playable yeah so

428
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,000
yes so i define not playable as

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
basically the game's psych faults when

430
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,559
you try to play it so it's a hard crash

431
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,640
um so the ones that were listed as not

432
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
playable

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
it would load and then the game would

434
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
crash um so you literally couldn't do

435
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
anything it would psycfault uh i didn't

436
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
trace into the code to see where it was

437
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,559
psych-faulting but

438
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,600
but

439
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,520
non-playable meant meant that the game's

440
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,600
like faulted at start or at load

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
okay and the front microphone hello

442
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
thanks for the talk

443
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
soon you've been saying you've been

444
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
tweaking the argument of the sine and

445
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
the cosine function but have you been

446
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
tweaking the sine and the cosine

447
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
function itself as well

448
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
no but that would be another great like

449
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
thing to do as a follow-up is to change

450
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
those lookup tables if it if it expects

451
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
a cosine and you give it a sign for

452
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
example right and c

453
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,039
see how that kind of modifies the the

454
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,120
geometry

455
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
and this and the same for the for the

456
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
changes because i think

457
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,679
it's you get really odd results as well

458
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,440
i guess but uh okay thanks

459
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,679
okay are there any more questions

460
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,760
if that is not the case ah you have a

461
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,120
question

462
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
okay you don't good

463
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
if that if you have a question you can

464
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
probably also ask him afterwards he will

465
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
probably be available just outside the

466
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,600
tent so thank you for the really vivid

467
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
talk i really enjoyed it and give him a

468
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
warm round of applause

469
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:09,790
[Applause]

470
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,199
you
