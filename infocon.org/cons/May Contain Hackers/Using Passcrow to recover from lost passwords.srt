2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
thank you all for coming

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,119
it's nice to see people because this is

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,520
not a project that has a community yet

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
and that's why i'm here i'm hoping that

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,960
people will be interested and want to

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,320
work with me

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
um as you said my name is bjarni

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
this project is a spin-off from my work

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
on mailpile which was supposed to be a

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,640
secure email client

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
i've had some ups and downs there

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
project's not dead but there's not much

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,879
to use at the moment

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,719
done a few other things been around for

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,160
a while

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
um

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
this is a joke but you have to be as old

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
as me to get it

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,480
um

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
so i want to start with the funny story

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
about mailpile so mail pyle was an email

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,680
client and we wanted to

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840
focus on privacy

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
from the very start we wanted to write

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,600
an application that took really good

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
care of people's data and information

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
and the obvious tool for that is

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,760
encryption so we wanted to download all

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,479
of your email from whatever providers

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
we're handling it for you

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,960
store it locally encrypt the storage

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
use tor use whatever tools are

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
applicable to

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
maintain privacy and

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,720
you know

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
we also took usability very seriously we

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,159
had people do tests we walked through

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
the setup of the app and and you know

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,439
when you're doing encryption locally

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,079
you always have to have some sort of key

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,360
and so one of the first things that

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,799
people had to do

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,399
in the setup phase so they were

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
installing this brand new app

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
and it asked them to choose a passphrase

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,399
and because

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,320
email is super important and this is

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
really sensitive data we encourage them

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,399
to choose a really really

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
long

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
strong passphrase you know four or five

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,399
words we even had a little generator

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
that would suggest passphrases for

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,119
people

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
and people did they chose a passphrase

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,720
and they typed it once and they typed it

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
in again and then they went and used the

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
app a bit

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
and they went back to log in and had

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
forgotten their passphrase

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
and this happened the majority of the

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,360
time

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
hello everybody welcome

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
so most people that went through this

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,520
particular usability test forgot the

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
passphrase that they had just chosen

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
within about a minute or two

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
it was amazing

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
um

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
there's a little happy ending there is

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,440
that there was something that came out

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
of these these tests and

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
what came out of it was a bug

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,280
so

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
the the application

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
the setup flow you want you type in your

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
passphrase and it's like okay now we can

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
encrypt everything lock it down

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,800
and it booted the user out it's like

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
okay the session is now invalid so now

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
they have to log in again

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
and it's like but i just typed in my

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
passphrase twice you want me to type it

85
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
in again

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
and that worked suddenly people stopped

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
forgetting their passphrase

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
so usability testing is great and

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,799
software design matters um

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
i'm already into this you know it's hard

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
to remember things repetition helps but

92
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,200
it took me a really long time to

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,879
reach this final insight that i've got

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
on the slide and

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
this is a problem that is common to so

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,599
many of the tools that we're using

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,480
we're asking our users now speaking we

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
developers of these tools and the

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
advocates of these tools

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
asking our users to make decisions about

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
security

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
way before they even know what the app

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,319
is for

104
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
like they haven't used it they have no

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
experience

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
and it has no information and it has no

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
data there's nothing of value there like

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,159
you know these bitcoins they're

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
worthless doesn't matter it's okay if i

110
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
forget the passphrase

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
where it's okay if i choose an insecure

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
one

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
and

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
then we don't revisit that so we ask

115
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
people to make really important

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
decisions

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
when they have absolutely

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,840
no ability to do so

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,599
so we're setting people up to fail right

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,840
there

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
and this brings me to

122
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
how the other guys deal with this stuff

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
um

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
there's always a way to undo stuff if

125
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
you're in the cloud if you've forgotten

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
your passphrase or lost your tokens

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
whatever there's usually a way to reset

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and regain access

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
so

130
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,880
for the general public and for the

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,840
average person who is forgetful

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
the availability and the reliability of

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
putting your data in the cloud

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
is so much greater than encrypting it

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
and storing it locally

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
because there's just failure modes that

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,639
they've fixed and we don't have

138
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
solutions for

139
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
google microsoft all these big guys you

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
know even little guys i think wordpress

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
has a really nice password reset flow

142
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
built into it every single web app does

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
but when you enter the world of

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
encryption we're taking important

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
information and we're encrypting it

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
we don't have that if you forget your

147
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
passphrase to your pgp key you create a

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
new key

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
and you probably don't know how to

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
publish that new key in a way that other

151
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
people will find it it's

152
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
a bit of a nightmare

153
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,919
same for hard drive encryption

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
the bitcoin wallet stories everyone's

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
heard those a million times

156
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
some of us like to laugh some of us are

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
really sad

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,039
but i think there's this really

159
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
interesting duality here when we compare

160
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
cloud-based storage solutions having

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,960
other people hold our data

162
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
with doing it ourselves using strong

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,080
crypto

164
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,199
in that

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
the pros and the cons are the same thing

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
like

167
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
it's we consider it from a privacy point

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
of view we consider it a huge problem

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
that these big corporations have our

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
information

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
until we need access to it again and

172
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
then suddenly that's a huge feature

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
there's a benefit that there's this

174
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,039
really nice person who can give us

175
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
access to our data again when we forgot

176
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,759
our stuff

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
and then it goes we go over to the

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
crypto side and we consider it to be a

179
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
feature and a benefit that without the

180
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
keys nobody has access

181
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
math protects our data

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
the structure of the universe protects

183
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
our data it's wonderful

184
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
until we lose the key and then math

185
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
protects our data structure the universe

186
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
says no and our data is gone

187
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
so

188
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
i'm not saying this

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,000
i'm not asking crypto to be less secure

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
but

191
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,479
i would like some form of password reset

192
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,639
that normal users that do not have

193
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
extreme threat models

194
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
can use and trust and rely on and then

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
we can deploy crypto in more places

196
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
so i started working on this and

197
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
thinking you know how do we solve this

198
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
and these are sort of the building

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
blocks that i was working with um

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,880
the first one

201
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
show me your secret sharing how many

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
people in here

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
have heard of that algorithm

204
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
well about half of you it's pretty good

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,199
it's really interesting algorithm it

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,240
lets you

207
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
take basically a number

208
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
and you can ask it to generate

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
five other numbers

210
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,360
and if you have three of them you can

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
assemble the first one so keys are just

212
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
numbers keys are big numbers

213
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
and these parameters are tunable you can

214
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
say i want

215
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,199
all five to be found

216
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
or i want just one so you can have one

217
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
of five or you can have four or five or

218
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
you have one of ten

219
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,520
so you can just pick and choose how you

220
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
want to use this algorithm so it's very

221
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
flexible

222
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,080
the other thing i wanted to build on is

223
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
i want to build on the cloud accounts

224
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
that people already have they have these

225
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
things where there is an established

226
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,879
flow for

227
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
identifying and authenticating users

228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
i just want to piggyback on top of that

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
and servers and storage are really cheap

230
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
so we have a lot of things that we can

231
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,879
build on and use

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
the design goals that i had

233
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
i want to solve this problem i want us

234
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,639
to be able to recover

235
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
a lost encryption key and although the

236
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,440
title of the talk is passwords

237
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
those boil down to the same thing

238
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
because usually a password is converted

239
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
into a key

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
using a hashing function or something

241
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
like that

242
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,319
there is ultimately a key that protects

243
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,000
access to your stuff and there can be

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
chains of them there can be a key that

245
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
encrypts another key that encrypts

246
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
another key and we can step in at some

247
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
point and say okay

248
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
this key we're going to make this key

249
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,280
recoverable

250
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
and the use cases for this it's not just

251
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,679
about forgetting things you know maybe

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
you lost something maybe you're using a

253
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
key card or a hardware token or

254
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
something and you've lost it

255
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,360
or it got broken

256
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
someone ran over it

257
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
or there's the use case where you're

258
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
dead

259
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
and you would like to have a way for

260
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
your family or your friends to gain

261
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,160
access to your digital

262
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
legacy really

263
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
so there are interesting use cases

264
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
important use cases

265
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,839
it needs to be secure enough i mean if

266
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,680
we're going to remove all of the

267
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
encryption

268
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
then why bother there it needs to be

269
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
something where people can tune it

270
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
for their needs and their threats

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
so that's one of the goals

272
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
has to be user friendly so people can

273
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
use it and not fail

274
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
and it has to be developer friendly

275
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
because i can invent this system

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
and be really proud of it but if nobody

277
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,839
builds it into their software then this

278
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
is all a wasted effort so

279
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
i want to reach out to any developers if

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
there are developers in the room come

281
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,319
talk to me

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
and finally because there is a server

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
component and i would like it to be not

284
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
just me running the server i would like

285
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
a community of servers i would like you

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,920
to be able to take fragments of your key

287
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,279
and put them here and there and there

288
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,680
and trust different people

289
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,080
we need a community of systems and so

290
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,839
the software needs to be accessible for

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
them and something that they're willing

292
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
to run and manage

293
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,720
so

294
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
those are the goals here's a really

295
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
dense one slide summary of how pascro

296
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,479
works

297
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,519
this is the this is the core of the

298
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,040
thing

299
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
so as i said earlier usually you have a

300
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
key that unlocks your information

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
what i want to do is i want to take that

302
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
key and i want to encrypt it with

303
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
another key so i generate a throwaway

304
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,399
key that is only used to encrypt this

305
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
really important secret

306
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
and that is then stored in the same

307
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
place as your encrypted data so those

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
things live together i don't take that

309
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,279
and put it anywhere else it's just

310
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
sitting there in the same place so

311
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
shared fate if that device functions

312
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,640
you've lost both things doesn't matter

313
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
they they're they

314
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
protect the same thing they're the same

315
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
thing

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
this recovery key which we use to

317
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
encrypt that little bit of information

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
we

319
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
split that using shamir so we split that

320
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
into these what i'm calling fragments

321
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,200
shamir calls them shares

322
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,959
we split into fragments and then we give

323
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
those fragments to the people running

324
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,399
the servers

325
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
but we do this carefully

326
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
the servers then make a promise so this

327
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
is a community and the server promises i

328
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
will not give you back this fragment

329
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,160
unless you prove who you are

330
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,440
using

331
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,519
an identity of your choice so you can

332
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,040
tell me i'm the server operator and you

333
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,399
say hey

334
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,399
only give me my fragment back if i can

335
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,079
verify that i have

336
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,079
the right telephone number or the right

337
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,600
email address

338
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
or a github account or something like

339
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
that

340
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
so what we have that's the core of the

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
idea i'm going to go back into it again

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,839
i'm going to give you a little demo show

343
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
you how the software behaves

344
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
today we have

345
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,480
most of the building blocks so basically

346
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
i have a first iteration of all of these

347
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
things

348
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,240
they're some documentation i've tried

349
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
really hard but

350
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,320
documentation is hard so if anyone wants

351
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
to read it and complain

352
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
that's very welcome

353
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,360
if it confuses you then i failed i need

354
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
to fix it

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
there's a client library for people that

356
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
are working in python

357
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
if this takes off there should be

358
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,079
libraries for other languages as well

359
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,040
but python is where i've started

360
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,720
there is a very simple server

361
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,639
implementation

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
doesn't perform very well it doesn't do

363
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,519
anything fancy but it doesn't work

364
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
and then there's a command line tool

365
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,480
because as i said

366
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
this isn't built into anyone's software

367
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
yet

368
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
so there is a command line tool so you

369
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
can experiment with it and play with it

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
you can set up manual recovery

371
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
yourself and imagine that we're in a

372
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
magical future where this is built into

373
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
our software

374
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
there's a website passport.org

375
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
it has a little intro

376
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,120
and has an overview of which servers are

377
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
live that will help with this recovery

378
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
process and at the moment there are two

379
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
both of which are run by me one of them

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
is for testing and the other one is for

381
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
more serious

382
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,120
or actual data if you trust it

383
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
that's

384
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
the url and the amazing logo that

385
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,880
crayon generated for me

386
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,240
so

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
if you were to go and install this i

388
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
decided to do a slideshow instead of

389
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
walking through on my laptop um

390
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,279
but

391
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,399
the first thing i'm doing there can

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
anyone can everyone see this

393
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,160
yeah

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,120
so

395
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
first thing is you can install it from

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,320
from pi pi so you just pip install

397
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,160
pascro

398
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
and then you run the first command would

399
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
you just be pascro init and what that

400
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
does it just sets up

401
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
a directory for storing information and

402
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,639
what i'm calling a default policy

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,680
and you can look at what's in that

404
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
default policy so that's that last line

405
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
there i'm opening it with vi because i'm

406
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,079
a hacker

407
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
you can see some interesting things here

408
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,079
like

409
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,399
i've edited the defaults

410
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,160
to add some bits

411
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
i'm specifying the ratio that's hard to

412
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,839
read it says three quarters three out of

413
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,040
four

414
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,320
so

415
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
if i give pastural four identities

416
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
it will require three of them for

417
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,560
recovery to succeed

418
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
by tuning the parameters to the shamir

419
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
algorithm as i mentioned earlier

420
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,199
and there are some timeouts i can say i

421
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,240
want this

422
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
data to expire in a year or in 10 years

423
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
or in five days or you know these are

424
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
things that can be tuned

425
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
and then there's a timeout

426
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
has anyone here not recovered a password

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,040
from something like gmail

428
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
everyone's done it so you're all

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
familiar with the fact that these little

430
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
codes that they send you are time

431
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,240
limited

432
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
that's that time out so we have the same

433
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,800
concept

434
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
i created a very valuable secret created

435
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,120
a file called secret.txt

436
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
and then i say passpro protect

437
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
secret.txt

438
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
and here i've given it my phone number

439
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,959
and my email address

440
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
and those are both correct so please

441
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
don't spam me

442
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,040
and

443
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
don't call me out of business hours

444
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,839
unless it's really exciting

445
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,959
we can ask the tool for a list and say

446
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
pascro list and then it will show you

447
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
which shares have been or which things

448
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,279
have been put in escrow

449
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,079
and

450
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,360
we're going to look inside one of these

451
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,959
files

452
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,040
it's just a json file

453
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
a bunch of parameters

454
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,759
there's a thing there line 4 is a secret

455
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,880
and that's a base64 encoded blob

456
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
and pasco doesn't care what's in there

457
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
but that is

458
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,800
that's the secret information that we

459
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,758
gave it to begin with

460
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
it says there that there's only

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
it has a

462
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,279
minimum of two shares because i only

463
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
gave it two identities

464
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
so it can't really do three out of four

465
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,360
so it approximates it does its best and

466
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,880
stores other things it needs to know to

467
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
recover things

468
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
this is what recovery looks like

469
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,560
passport recover and they tell

470
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
secrets.txt it remembers that's what it

471
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
was protecting before

472
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
it contacts the two servers and it asks

473
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
them to verify

474
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
and then it tells me i should expect to

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
receive an sms or a phone call and i

476
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
should expect to receive an email and it

477
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
gives hints about where those will be

478
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
sent to

479
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,519
and this is done server sides the server

480
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,759
side doesn't send the full identity back

481
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
wow i've talked way too slow

482
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,040
so

483
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
if someone else initiates recovery they

484
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,880
don't know exactly which accounts to

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
look at and again this is familiar from

486
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
recovery for other things

487
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
once i receive the codes i run passcode

488
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,800
recover again i give it the codes

489
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
and it

490
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
well it sent me an sms this works it

491
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
does goes through twilio an american

492
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
company i'm sure we all trust

493
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
um

494
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
sent me an email

495
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
that went there's mailpilot it totally

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
exists

497
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
i recover

498
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,160
and it's hard to see because there's a

499
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,319
bunch of other output but it shows the

500
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
input the contents of the file that i

501
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
gave it to begin with this is my secret

502
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,919
and then i can tell it to forget all

503
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
about it so then it goes and deletes the

504
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
local information and asks the servers

505
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,839
to delete the stuff they have on file as

506
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,799
well

507
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
so that's the tool this is all the tool

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
does you've seen the whole thing

509
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,880
and you can install it and play with it

510
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,200
so back to the design goals again secure

511
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
enough um

512
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
the way i'm doing that is obviously we

513
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
encrypt any communication that we do

514
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
when we talk to the server that's

515
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,080
encrypted

516
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
the password servers they don't have

517
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
your data

518
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,960
all they have is

519
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
an encrypted blob

520
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
which they cannot read to begin with and

521
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
inside that encrypted blob is your

522
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,000
identity and a fragment of the recovery

523
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
key not the whole thing

524
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
the reason these things are encrypted is

525
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
you know to protect your privacy so when

526
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
you initiate recovery when you say to

527
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
passpro i want to recover my stuff

528
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,559
password goes back to that recovery pack

529
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
which is stored locally

530
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,320
finds the key that was generated to

531
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,919
encrypt the thing the server has and

532
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,440
says here server now you're allowed to

533
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,520
decrypt your instructions

534
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
and so then it opens up the you know

535
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
recovery envelope thing

536
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
finds the identity

537
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
and sends you a code or asks you to

538
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,679
visit a website and log in through some

539
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
other things

540
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
and this

541
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
means in these little codes that we're

542
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,640
sending around

543
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
this means that these providers the

544
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,880
email providers twilio

545
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
they never see any key material at all

546
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
all they're seeing is this temporary

547
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,799
code that lasts 30 minutes or 20 minutes

548
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
or whatever the user decides

549
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,240
and

550
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
you know we're leaking very little

551
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,399
information

552
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
yeah as i said the user is in control of

553
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
those things

554
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
and

555
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,919
it's kind of important is that

556
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,799
because usually you would have three out

557
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,360
of four or something like that

558
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
servers can go offline pasco servers can

559
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
be dead and you can still probably

560
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
recover

561
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
and most of the time you're not

562
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
recovering so pascal servers don't have

563
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
to have very high uptime they can go

564
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,679
down for maintenance without the admins

565
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
being stressed out

566
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
and of course all of this is open source

567
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
hopefully peer review will contribute to

568
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,360
the security of things

569
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,120
user friendly

570
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
the main key that makes this

571
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
user-friendly is that this is a really

572
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
familiar pattern we already know how to

573
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
do this we don't have to teach users new

574
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,480
stuff

575
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
we just have to add these options to our

576
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
software

577
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,120
uh developer friendly you know docs

578
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
stuff i don't know if i'm succeeding at

579
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,600
this yet maybe you can tell me

580
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,679
and sis has been friendly i'm a little

581
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,039
more comfortable there i've been an

582
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
admin for a while

583
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,799
so i've made sure the admins themselves

584
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
don't feel at risk they don't have data

585
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
that has value

586
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
they don't know who their users are

587
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
their users are anonymous so

588
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,880
they're there's limited gain in hacking

589
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
a pascro server there's not much to find

590
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,080
there

591
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
um

592
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,960
so this relates to that i already

593
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,159
mentioned the uptime isn't a major thing

594
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,799
and uh you can do things like rate limit

595
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,400
because passcode isn't something which

596
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
you're using constantly

597
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
so you can have really strict rate

598
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,360
limits i can say you know

599
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,679
five requests per minute

600
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,240
and that will suffice to recover

601
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
but it will make it very hard for people

602
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
to put any load on the server

603
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
so that's most of the talk

604
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
thanks for listening

605
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,400
and i'm on time

606
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,480
i'm up here because this has reached the

607
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
point where i need help this

608
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,360
has

609
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,799
this whole effort has no meaning if

610
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
people don't use it

611
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,600
and

612
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
if it's only me then you know i'm just

613
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
another guy on stage saying hey trust me

614
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
instead of that other guy and that's not

615
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
how this stuff's supposed to work so

616
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,679
if you're interested in this please find

617
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
me after the talk or find me during camp

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,679
i'm here for all of camp

619
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
and i'm at the quarantine arms village

620
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
when i'm not wandering around looking

621
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
for fun

622
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,559
so that's my talk thank you for

623
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,200
listening and

624
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,410
[Music]

625
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
thank you can you hear me

626
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,960
yes okay thank you viana for great talk

627
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
um there is time for q a if you want to

628
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
ask a question please go to the mic i'm

629
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
already seeing somebody running

630
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
but mike is yours

631
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,360
oh

632
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,960
you hear me now

633
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,440
a little bit okay um i think you've hit

634
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
up an important problem it's good idea

635
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
to take power away from the cloud

636
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
services of course

637
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
um we're doing similar things with

638
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,799
authentication so we can speak up a tiny

639
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,120
bit um we're doing similar things with

640
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
authentication definitely want to talk

641
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,360
to you afterwards okay um but the big

642
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,039
question with these things is how

643
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
flexible is it as in if your sms number

644
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
new phone number changes or your email

645
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
address change can you without decoding

646
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,919
and re-encoding your uh documents which

647
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
may be many can you change over to to a

648
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
new retro system okay so the question

649
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
just repeating it for the stream

650
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
you're and i hope i get it right you're

651
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
asking whether people can easily change

652
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
which identities they're using um in the

653
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,640
middle of things so if they lose access

654
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,880
to an email address how easy it is it to

655
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
switch to another one

656
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,600
and

657
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
the thing is

658
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
yes and no like if you're working with

659
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,039
the information on a regular basis if

660
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
this is built into an app like an email

661
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
client that you're using that email

662
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,799
client can just do that automatically it

663
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
just re-registers you don't even have to

664
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
know it might do that automatically for

665
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,760
you

666
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,919
if you set up escrow for something like

667
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
an offline hard drive

668
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
you're going to have to know that you

669
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,159
need to go and do that again

670
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,760
and the way you do it is you just put

671
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,200
stuff in escrow again you throw away the

672
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
old keys

673
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
ask the servers to forget if you still

674
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,559
have access to the recovery pack and you

675
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,080
just set it up again and it's very cheap

676
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
these are tiny requests tiny amounts of

677
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
data so doing it again isn't a burden

678
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
okay

679
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,960
next question and please talk straight

680
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,200
into the microphone

681
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
one moment is the microphone

682
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
maybe now hi i was just wondering if you

683
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
could elaborate and maybe state more

684
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,200
explicitly your threat model in

685
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
particular around when servers are

686
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
compromised and if your three or four

687
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,000
verification thing is a little unclear

688
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
to me whether this was three or four

689
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,039
like emails and phone numbers or three

690
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,720
or four servers that are collaborating

691
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
and if you could just elaborate how that

692
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,799
is and intended to work

693
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
okay so to repeat back you'd like me to

694
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,120
elaborate a little bit on the threat

695
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,440
model of

696
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,279
how many servers are involved how many

697
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,200
identities are involved whether those

698
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
are linked

699
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
that kind of thing

700
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
and

701
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
i'm not actually prescribing anything

702
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,640
about that

703
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,880
the system is quite flexible and it ends

704
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
up being up to the application

705
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,919
so

706
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,799
the

707
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,640
developer of the application that ends

708
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
up using the passcode library

709
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
i assume that they know way better than

710
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
i do what kind of data they're

711
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
protecting and how valuable it is

712
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,840
and some of this is out of my control

713
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
because until we have more servers it's

714
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,559
all going through the same one

715
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,720
but if we had a hundred servers on

716
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
different continents and different legal

717
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
jurisdictions

718
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
a tool could make intelligent choices

719
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,440
and say okay i would like

720
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
i wouldn't i would like law enforcement

721
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,039
to not be able to subpoena all of the

722
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,480
pascro servers

723
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
easily so you could spread things around

724
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,799
the system is completely agnostic to

725
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,679
that

726
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,799
so it really depends on how much

727
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,279
momentum we get what kind of guarantees

728
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,440
we can give people how much security we

729
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
can provide

730
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,159
does that answer it

731
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
and you can always ask again after us

732
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,880
yes next question i have a

733
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,000
one remark and one question

734
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,799
let me start with the question

735
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,360
if i lose the recovery pack

736
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
i can't get my data back correct

737
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,520
yes that's correct if you lose the

738
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,919
recovery pack your data is gone all

739
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,640
right well you can't recover your data

740
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,320
hopefully you still have access to it to

741
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
other means yeah so but if i use this

742
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,919
for example to

743
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
do a backup of my hard drive encryption

744
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,440
secret and

745
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
the recovery pack is on my fully

746
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,960
encrypted hard drive but it's kind of

747
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,679
useless yeah of course you need the

748
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,320
recovery pack needs to be stored

749
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
clear text

750
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
and ideally on the same physical medium

751
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
as the encrypted data

752
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
so that they have shared fate so that

753
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,039
you know if if that male drive is

754
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,200
malfunctioned it doesn't matter whether

755
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
you can decrypt it or not

756
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
but if you put those things in two

757
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
different places if you put the recovery

758
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
pack over here and you put the data over

759
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,039
here

760
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,720
these things can start

761
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
behaving in ways that don't match and

762
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,840
and that's a lot harder to reason about

763
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
my remark was

764
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
you were using some your secret sharing

765
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
which for me almost never makes sense

766
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,200
the whole idea of shamir secret sharing

767
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,320
is to scale k out of n recovery to avoid

768
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,360
the k over n complexity

769
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,000
now how many authentication methods are

770
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
you going to have 100

771
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,559
do a 50 over 100

772
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,080
where do you get the scalability problem

773
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
that requires using of show me your

774
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,240
secret sharing you know if i have five

775
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
different authentication methods and i

776
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
say four out of five

777
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
you know i can

778
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
i don't need xiaomi a secret sharing to

779
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,679
do that and if you do show me your

780
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,600
secret sharing you limit me to k out of

781
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,480
n

782
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
and i can't use other kinds of

783
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,600
combinations

784
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
like saying you know two methods for him

785
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
and two methods for him or three methods

786
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
for this guy i think we're getting into

787
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
the weeds a tiny bit

788
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
the thing is it does what i need and

789
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
it's very likely the algorithm can do

790
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
other things as well

791
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
and when i started doing this i did not

792
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,919
use xiaomi secret sharing

793
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,159
i had my own little ad hoc thing where i

794
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,159
was doing xors of things against each

795
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,279
other and

796
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,360
it just became unwieldy

797
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
shamir does exactly what i want i can

798
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,159
say

799
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,720
i have four email addresses

800
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,799
any three of them suffice

801
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,200
and i can ask shamir to generate the

802
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
fragments that i need

803
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,200
and you know whether that is secure or

804
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,799
not that depends entirely on how many

805
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,320
identities the user is willing to go

806
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,200
through

807
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
and that becomes a usability issue and

808
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,000
it becomes a matter of threat modeling

809
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
for some users it doesn't make sense to

810
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,158
do this at all

811
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,200
okay

812
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,919
i see somebody else um i would say this

813
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
is the last one

814
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,200
so um

815
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
well two comments uh so one phillip

816
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,399
bragaway has a nice and some nice paper

817
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
phil brago is a very famous uh symmetric

818
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,360
cryptographer he's a very uh he has some

819
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,679
very nice papers uh are

820
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
and i can't remember the names of the

821
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,880
thing or anything at the moment maybe i

822
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,399
can help you find it later if you need

823
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,440
on

824
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
doing

825
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,039
he what he wanted is he wanted a

826
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,320
packet form

827
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
basically a format for

828
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,559
sharing data with journalists which was

829
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
also doing this kind of like

830
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
splitting the thing out and whatever

831
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
anyway um so it's using shamir secret

832
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,039
sharing and it's it it achieves he

833
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
basically sort of outlined about in a

834
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
very rigorous way a bunch of the goals

835
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,039
and non-goals and whatever so it

836
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
probably people working in this should

837
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
at least look at what he did and try and

838
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
understand it um

839
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
the but i haven't done that so i can't

840
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,720
give you uh uh concrete comments um

841
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
the other one is that there's a very

842
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,960
when you are using shamir there's a very

843
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
nice thing that you can do which is you

844
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
can construct new shares

845
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,320
um to give out to new service you know
