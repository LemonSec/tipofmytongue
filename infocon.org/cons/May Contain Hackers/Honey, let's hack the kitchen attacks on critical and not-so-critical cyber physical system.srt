[Music]

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,279
first of all thanks a lot for being here

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,560
um

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,600
today i have for you a couple stories uh

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,519
this talk is more than actually doing

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,199
the hack is telling you

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,599
uh from what we are seeing that other

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
people are doing hacking some very

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
important things and some less important

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,040
things

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,399
and

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
well yeah try to give you a bit of that

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,600
background from the threat intelligence

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,719
perspective

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,640
uh also to bring up a bit of the

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
discussion of how it's blurring the

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
difference between attacks on privacy

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,520
and attacks on on the physical world

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,079
to begin just a quick background just of

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,920
where i'm coming from that gives an idea

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
of where this stock is going to be going

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,879
to

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
um well i'm mexican but i currently live

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,640
in netherlands uh my background is in

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
trade intelligence so basically

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
trying to gather information from

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,320
different places put all together

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
and my main specialty is in ot control

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
systems

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
i think there are a couple talks also in

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,439
control systems so if you see anything

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
like that i deeply encourage you

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
very similar and at the same time a very

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,799
different world

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,240
you're gonna see some of the slight

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
differences

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
but yeah that being said i'll jump

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
straight away into a

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
quick story

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
so to make this very dramatic i decided

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
to start with this story

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,240
um

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,759
basically in

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,479
what i believe june 2020

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,119
we saw an event where there was uh there

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,119
were some explosions in uh iranian

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
nuclear facilities reportedly

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,759
one of them was nathan's which is known

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
because there was a

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
a big cyber attack

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
like 10 years ago

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
and as this news started

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
happening but when they were publishing

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
some of the news sources said someone

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,560
came in planted a bump but some others

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,399
obviously said this is a cyber attack it

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
has to be

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
whether it's a bombing cyber attack that

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
goes beyond the stock

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
but what is interesting in this case is

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
that some people took that very

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
seriously and so what they started doing

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
was they said okay let's go and hack

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
some things

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
let's go and take revenge on these guys

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,720
that are you know doing these cyber

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
attacks against uh iran

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,720
and those where these guys these are two

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
specific teams of

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
basically well i'm saying teams it could

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
be one person it could be a team it's

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
the things that we observe in in dark

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,879
web forums

74
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
uh vortex team or identified team they

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
publish this this uh what we call hmi

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
which is uh stands for human machine

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
interface uh that is basically the panel

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
that you see for controlling a physical

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
application whatever it is

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
and they said we compromised this gas

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
system this is in revenge for what

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
happened a couple days ago it's terrible

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
and we're gonna blow up something

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
but then the first question comes out

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,200
here

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
does anyone here knows if this is a gas

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,879
system

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,000
and or

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
what is a gas system

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,319
which is a very good question

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,920
well no idea what is a gas system it

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
could be many things you know the point

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
is that the guys weren't entirely sure

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
what they were looking into

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,560
so

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
what we decided to do first is you just

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
go to your the tool of your preference

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
in this case jodan we started looking

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
into it to figure out what is it that

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
these guys are looking into is it really

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
dangerous you know how bad is their

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,680
their revenge

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
and of course we find it based on we

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
look at a couple of the key words of the

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
information they they shared something

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
from the image and whatnot and then we

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,799
found it

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
and what it actually was

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
was a kitchen

110
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,319
it was a kitchen uh which i mean not to

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
blame them uh of course this this system

112
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
for the kitchens is is

113
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
relatively complex it does have a

114
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
logical controller it does have what

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
they call variable frequency drives

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
which control you know how quick some

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,760
motors are rotating it does contain uh

118
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
basically like the hdmi that you saw and

119
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,760
basically well i mean yeah what they

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,159
found was was a kitchen in israel it

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,840
didn't we don't know even if it had

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,599
impact or not of course

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
we notified the vendor and that is why

124
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,839
the image wasn't there anymore they are

125
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
already selling the product differently

126
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,918
but anyway the point in here is you're

127
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,520
going to see there are tons of actors

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,280
trying to do this sometimes it's going

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
to be very interesting sometimes it's

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
not and i have stories for both case

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
but first of all

132
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
to describe a bit of the trend or the

133
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
tendency what is this all about and why

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
do i want to even come talk about it

135
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
right if it's about kitchens and and

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
whatnot

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,479
but this is more about what i call the

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,520
evolution of cyber physical threats

139
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
attention the evolution i highlight

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
because

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
historically the first attacks that we

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
saw on a physical type of system were

143
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,919
maybe around 2010 they called our

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
attention because it was a nuclear

145
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
facility it was very important nuclear

146
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,919
centrifuges go down a country or some

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
countries against another country make a

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
big impact great

149
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
and most of the industry started

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
focusing on that

151
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
but over the years mainly since around

152
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
2017 we started seeing more uh from

153
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
cyber crime basically ransomware

154
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
impacting physical processes how we can

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,919
get access to different services and

156
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,199
whatnot

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
and of course uh we started seeing well

158
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,919
different types of financial threats and

159
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,400
recently we started seeing like an optic

160
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
in what we call opportunistic uh type of

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
factors uh basically activists and

162
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,680
whatnot it can be a single person can be

163
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
a group that are looking actively for

164
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
this type of

165
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,639
internet connected physical systems and

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,160
oftentimes for no reasons you know like

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
just profit i want to look cool i want

168
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
to do something funny you know

169
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
so this is something that we refer to as

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
low sophistication compromises just you

171
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,440
know like the fancy intelligence name

172
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
uh but the point to highlight here is uh

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,199
three points they can do it for ideology

174
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
that's when we talk about uh hacktivist

175
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
eagle just opportunistic or sometimes

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
financial

177
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
and then

178
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
uh well we're going to mention a bit

179
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,199
more of the cases but

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
how do they actually do this is actually

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
fairly simple which is the reason why

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
right now we're not going to go super in

183
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,520
it's not going to be super technical

184
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
because ironically most of these attacks

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,680
are actually super simple

186
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,880
normally what you would do is just

187
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
choose the

188
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,919
platform of your preferences to go and

189
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
and scan around in this case i mentioned

190
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
some examples showdown senses who my

191
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
full file it could be google could be

192
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
whichever

193
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
and then as long as you know what you're

194
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
looking for like some specific keywords

195
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,440
it can be specific for an industry it

196
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,960
can be for

197
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
i don't know the past case if you look

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
for dampers you would have found that

199
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
image because the damper is specifically

200
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
part of the docked where where the the

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
air was coming from then you choose the

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
system that you want to go then you go

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
you share it in a forum and then you say

204
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,759
look how cool i am i'm going to destroy

205
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
the world and then everyone starts

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
caring about it so it is working very

207
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
interestingly from a reputational

208
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
perspective

209
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,560
and so

210
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
the reason why we started reporting more

211
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
on this was because around 2020 we

212
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
developed this timeline

213
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,599
in this timeline it was um

214
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
well we group different types of attacks

215
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
we include the tags uh some tutorials

216
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,120
that they do like actually telling you

217
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
how to do it we're going to show some of

218
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,440
those that are fairly simple

219
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
they started some of them reconnaissance

220
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,720
just gathering information about the

221
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
process how it works what it is trying

222
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,080
to learn about it

223
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
we saw others when i say unauthorized

224
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
access it means that sometimes they

225
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
would just do the compromise and just

226
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
drop it for no reason at all or just to

227
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,759
say i don't know

228
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
i have access to

229
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
i don't know a fire alarm system anyone

230
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
wants it and then they go and they offer

231
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
or they charge a price for it

232
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
and then the most concerning is the that

233
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
there are some guys that actually do go

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
and interact with the process that

235
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
actually they go and say like oh what

236
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
what's this lever for what happens if i

237
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,319
click here

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,840
and most often when they're complex

239
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
processes like if it's in a water

240
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
facility or if it's in an energy

241
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
facility or whatnot there are going to

242
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
be different uh

243
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
different backup mechanisms right safety

244
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
mechanisms that are going to stop you

245
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
from actually making a change

246
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
but uh that is not always the case if

247
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,919
it's something more simple like like the

248
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,240
heating in your in your building

249
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
then probably they might be able to just

250
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
change it without any problem

251
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
um

252
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
and yeah so this is the big the big

253
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
shift that we started that we started

254
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
looking and an increase in the numbers

255
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
which we can also show you uh back with

256
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
actual real numbers right

257
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
uh some people started asking about this

258
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
this is this is not a comprehensive

259
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
sample you can go and find pretty much

260
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
more i'm pretty sure it's just you know

261
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,279
it's in the end there's as much as you

262
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
can do in the forums but we selected a

263
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
smaller sample of cases that we found

264
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
interesting to show you know these ones

265
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
where the ones we

266
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
kind of validated some of what they were

267
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,120
showing that there was something

268
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
interesting

269
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
and different reasons what they were

270
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
offering so in some of them it was like

271
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
hey you know here's the access go take

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
for it uh i just compromised it here's

273
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
for you

274
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,279
you know the different ones

275
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,839
and this goes until 2021 and i recognize

276
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,920
where one year later so i didn't want to

277
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
forget that something more relevant

278
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
would be uh discussing the most

279
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,640
recent

280
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
and the point is that

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
one of the big changes that we've seen

282
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
with this activity is that it started

283
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
something that was says let's just go

284
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
and have fun let's go and find it let's

285
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
go and get reputation

286
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,880
and it has recently switched also into

287
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
something about uh let's go and share

288
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,839
some of my world views let's go and try

289
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
to defend the cause let's go and try to

290
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
support something and of course the

291
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,839
ukraine cases come up quite a lot we

292
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,080
have seen a lot of cases that are

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
on different sides a country against

294
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
country

295
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
and at the same time the the ones from

296
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
before that we're doing for example in

297
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
israel uh or iran or you know specific

298
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
areas that are normally targeted

299
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,959
they started

300
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,800
showing an optic so the next year when

301
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
we have our numbers are going to

302
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
continue going up well

303
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
they are already going up by now and

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
we're going to bring some very

305
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
interesting cases of this because again

306
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
some of them are very interesting uh

307
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
there have been actually some news

308
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
recently uh some attacks for example

309
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
particularly in iran on gas pumps that

310
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
was something in the news very

311
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,279
interesting

312
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,160
um

313
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
that could have been as simple as this

314
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
but there are also some that are

315
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
you know just claiming again uh

316
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,360
something that has nothing to do

317
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
so

318
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
knowing the background um i feel it's

319
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
important just to know about the trend

320
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,519
but i think the most interesting

321
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,320
actually is to go and take a look at uh

322
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,120
the stories right

323
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,079
so

324
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,440
i begin with the

325
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,880
important stories the relevant that the

326
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
ones that actually have you know like

327
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
have had an impact or at least sound a

328
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
bit concerning because you know just

329
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
just respect to those then i'll get to

330
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
the funny ones but uh this first one

331
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
actually happened

332
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,399
like uh two weeks ago i believe

333
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,880
it was uh an iranian steel facility

334
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
allegedly this actor actually this is

335
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
the original tweet where the actor came

336
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
out and pushed this is what we did

337
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
there's a full video showing like the

338
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
plants you know it explodes they claim

339
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
to be taking care of the individuals in

340
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
the plant and they share this as

341
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
evidence let's say it doesn't match

342
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,079
directly as evidence but that's that's

343
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,240
how they want to play it that it's one

344
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
of those machine interfaces

345
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
um what's interesting about this is at

346
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
this point it's it's a bit difficult to

347
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
tell if in fact how did they do it if it

348
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
actually is simple

349
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
for even if they are if this is a

350
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
legitimate actor if this falls into this

351
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
category but right now they are using

352
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
the same tactics that other of these

353
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,920
load sophistication actors and trying to

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,320
call attention in a very similar way

355
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
so this is one of the of the

356
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
first times that we see these attacks

357
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
having a real impact and including this

358
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
type of hacktivism or low sophistication

359
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,399
component

360
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
then a second one that was actually from

361
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,800
last year for this one we have already a

362
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
bit more information because it already

363
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
took place some some time ago

364
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
this one happened in florida i played a

365
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
small place called oldsmar

366
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,519
and uh it was actually reported directed

367
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
by authorities there they started doing

368
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,760
some some research and what happened is

369
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
that an actor just got access to the

370
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
machine interface that they use for

371
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
for basically for the water

372
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
and um apparently what they tried to do

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
was to modify the parameters in the

374
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
water of chemicals that they have

375
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
and uh well this actually can have an

376
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,480
impact also on an individual

377
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,920
the good thing the good news is that

378
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
obviously it's a water facility it's not

379
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
so simple it's not like you just click

380
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
here and everything changes normally

381
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
there are safety mechanisms you have you

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
would need an actor that actually goes

383
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
through the entire process of water

384
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
understands the different stops and how

385
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
you would you would go about it and

386
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
these guys instead just just went and

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
tried to modify so for the operator the

388
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
person there sitting on the other side

389
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,800
it was very easy to just sit down and

390
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
say like okay nope not right now

391
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
the interesting thing here also in terms

392
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
of impact and that's why these random

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
notes

394
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
uh it just

395
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
that's actually like a like a house

396
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
analysis it was like uh as funny as it

397
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
sounds my mother is a chemist and she

398
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
was very excited when she heard these

399
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
stories and she said i'm gonna make an

400
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
exercise for my students so this is how

401
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
you integrate in schools right it's like

402
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
a cyber attack comes and then what would

403
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
happen

404
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
and then

405
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
the task for the students would be to

406
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
actually calculate the ph level of the

407
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
water with this new addition

408
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,760
and actually well it should be around

409
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
seven the value went up to 13 if the

410
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,079
change would have happened

411
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,920
so this could be pretty destructive for

412
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
your body as you can imagine

413
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
if you really want to know what it does

414
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
to your body i would suggest

415
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
to basically just google it and i

416
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
promise you're going to have nightmares

417
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,079
it could be really horrible

418
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,560
so

419
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
we went google docking we went to look a

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
bit for for this some of these examples

421
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
of the the hmis and the first thing that

422
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,720
we found is very quickly this is a

423
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,399
i'm going to say real image from one of

424
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,880
the vendors third-party services

425
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
that make these

426
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
machine interfaces for this florida

427
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,120
plant

428
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
and basically well they had these images

429
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
of how their their machine interfaces

430
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
work they had all these documentation

431
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
information it

432
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,639
very likely was the same one that the

433
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
actors saw based on like i have it

434
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
marked somewhere around but i can see

435
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
from here uh but basically they have

436
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,680
there the specific chemical change that

437
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
that had happened so we believe that

438
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
might be the case we can't tell

439
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
um but yeah i mean like like beyond

440
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
beyond telling if this was directly the

441
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
hmi it just gives an idea of how you

442
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
know you can start gathering more

443
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
information based on like the attack

444
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,519
happens what comes next and try to to

445
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,680
find it what the actor might have known

446
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,440
before doing the the attack

447
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
and well yeah that's as much but

448
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,199
actually this uh one thing that i forgot

449
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,360
is that for this specific attack

450
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,760
it wasn't only scanning and finding but

451
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
actually they did compromise well

452
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
apparently reportedly they compromise

453
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
one endpoint and then they reuse exactly

454
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
the same password for accessing the

455
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
machine of the

456
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
of the person that that was accessing

457
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,560
these panels uh which normally you do it

458
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,639
via something that's called vnc

459
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
which i'm gonna mention later

460
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
then another case another big case is

461
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
this one for uh

462
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
israel this is actually um

463
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
an advisory that they place from from

464
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
the government from israel i think it

465
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
was also 2021 and what they were saying

466
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
is uh hey you know like be careful

467
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
there's some actor that's actually

468
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
trying to compromise by many of our

469
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
systems

470
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
uh we are not entirely sure what they

471
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,519
were but based on other news and other

472
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
things we found most likely they were

473
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
also water water related

474
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,880
and um

475
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
what was interesting of this case is

476
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
that it wasn't only actually finding the

477
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,279
device and clicking on the button but

478
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
actually it was finding the device uh

479
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,959
and then what they would go and find is

480
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
what we call a programmable

481
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,560
logical uh

482
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
controller plc

483
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,199
and then they would go and find this plc

484
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
and then they would interact with the

485
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,959
plc they are often connected to internet

486
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,040
not always but some of them and then

487
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
they would change what's called the the

488
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
la the logical the

489
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,240
busy with

490
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
ladder logic which is kind of like like

491
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,040
the programming that you use for for

492
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,199
that controller so they went and they

493
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
used the software to for this controller

494
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
they switched it and then you know that

495
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,279
that's how the attack happened what's

496
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,880
very interesting of an attack like this

497
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,959
is that actually the access is

498
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
unintended so the compromise yeah

499
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,000
there's a compromise but it's very

500
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
simple i'm pretty sure you've heard of

501
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
people compromising systems without

502
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,759
passwords many times

503
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,279
but what was interesting here is

504
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
actually that change in the in the plc

505
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
logic is something that we hadn't seen

506
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
uh unless it's from actually like a

507
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
state actor

508
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,839
so

509
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
basically the one of the points in here

510
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
is yeah it's we're seeing that people

511
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,120
are learning how to do this they are

512
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
learning about these attacks

513
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
and well the more they learn the more we

514
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,800
see them the more concerning they become

515
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,759
so

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
um well this is just the specific

517
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,759
techniques if you're into some people

518
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,760
love watching it just like the miter

519
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
version of

520
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
the techniques basically initial access

521
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
just connecting internet accessible plc

522
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
then they use the specific common ports

523
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
uh if anyone here is familiar with this

524
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,199
type of industrial applications there

525
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,319
are some ports that you're going to see

526
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,439
here that immediately you're going to

527
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,919
say 102. it's it's a

528
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,919
siemens products assignment blah blah

529
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,119
you're going to see multiple seats in

530
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,799
most it's anything from building

531
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,120
automation to a nuclear plant to a

532
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,600
energy facility to it's going to be

533
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
you know it's one of the most used and

534
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
another one from ge general electric

535
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
again you see these these vendors often

536
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
often mentioned in there

537
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,840
uh and well there's what i mentioned use

538
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
the software modify the logic and then

539
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
modify what what the

540
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,080
controller is actually doing

541
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,080
now this brings up

542
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,679
a big question about it and it's just

543
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,960
going to open the door actually to more

544
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
and more and more cases which is

545
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
uh to what extent can we call this well

546
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
there was a discussion of hacktivism

547
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
right like there's some activism

548
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
component does it mean it actually has

549
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
to be considered positive because there

550
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
is like this opinion ideology but then

551
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
what they are doing actually there's

552
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
like this

553
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,480
thin barrier where it's not anymore like

554
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
in the past about let's go and

555
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
compromise a website and make a message

556
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
but actually let's go and let's mess up

557
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,039
with something physical

558
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,480
so yeah that's one of the concerns that

559
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
we have but other guys that claim

560
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
themselves to be to follow us as you

561
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,200
know

562
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
activists are

563
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,720
have been doing this other uh

564
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
type of hacks these ones i can go

565
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
through them much quicker it's uh this

566
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
one actually is controls a dam like a

567
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
small dam

568
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
uh the other one that you see here is

569
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,880
actually for solar panels

570
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,679
uh

571
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
this is from different entirely

572
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
different groups and what they did

573
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,360
instead was to just go deploy the

574
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
scanners and then they sent us a bunch

575
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
of ip addresses they say all of these

576
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
systems are unprotected just go play

577
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
with them they share it in the in the

578
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
forum and then you know whomever wants

579
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
to go someplace with them as you can

580
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,679
tell there's

581
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,360
just like like

582
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,679
estimating what what those are you know

583
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,200
you can see there there's some water

584
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,799
there's a water tank

585
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
you know some of them might be gates

586
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,919
might be alarm systems might be building

587
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
automation might be anything some very

588
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,039
simple to more complex

589
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
and others are also doing their homework

590
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
so like the ones i showed a second ago

591
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
that they were you know making mistakes

592
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
uh these others actually are start i

593
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,360
started to share not only the the screen

594
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
or what they have access to but actually

595
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
doing some research on the process

596
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
itself so these two images ironically i

597
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
mean it's not as complicated as you

598
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,120
think to find them because literally

599
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
they got them from encyclopedia

600
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,039
britannica and they posted their like

601
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,799
their homework and then they posted the

602
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
panels that they found

603
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
uh some examples one interesting thing

604
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,320
here is that these are uh like like

605
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
directly the panels for management for

606
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
the for controllers instead of uh the

607
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
human machine interfaces that are more

608
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
more visual

609
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
and yeah i mean like it's just another

610
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
type of actor yet

611
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,000
and this is a fun one also this one is

612
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
other actors and what they do is they go

613
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
and share videos look at what i'm doing

614
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
look where i clicked i hope that they're

615
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,799
going to have a terrible time and this

616
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,039
one is for actually

617
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
they had like a long video where they

618
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
got access to systems of a big known

619
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,280
hotel in australia

620
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
and they started showing how they play

621
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,120
with temperature with their conditioning

622
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
with the water with but not who knows

623
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,280
you know maybe they had some angry

624
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,000
guests that day but i guess that's we

625
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
will never know

626
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
uh but yeah that shows one of one of the

627
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
direct impacts like like on a business

628
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
level

629
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
but so um

630
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,559
i mean like i promised i brought first

631
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,280
the

632
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
the bad cases the ones where where i say

633
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
yeah there can be an impact and then i'm

634
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
gonna go back to the ones where i say uh

635
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,640
it's nothing you know don't don't worry

636
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,360
but

637
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,559
i'm gonna get a bit more into the

638
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
opinions about that uh for now the only

639
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
thing i have to point out is that uh

640
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
thanks to this guy he actually allowed

641
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
us to use uh his image uh obviously for

642
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
non-profit reasons

643
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
but uh yeah it's just one of my

644
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
favorites

645
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,480
um

646
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,600
so

647
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
amateurs let's talk about the the the

648
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,679
funny cases that i was mentioning this

649
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
first one i already mentioned it is the

650
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
kitchen as i mentioned you get the gas

651
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,559
systems that actually are a kitchen but

652
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
it's our our favorite

653
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,880
then you go to the second one

654
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,240
the second one is actually one of my

655
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
favorite guys he's actually a latin

656
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,600
american

657
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
guy

658
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,559
fairly clear about

659
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
what they do and what they want to do

660
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
so actually this guy actually claims to

661
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
have an intelligence company and his

662
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
intelligence company is a website uh

663
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,679
basically where they offer dumps and

664
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
leaks and you know tons of uh of things

665
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
i don't know if they make money or not

666
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
or whatever but you know

667
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,159
uh what's interesting is that most of

668
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,440
the offerings from this person are

669
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
actually quite open you don't have to

670
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
even go like like really

671
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
you know into dark web forums or

672
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
anything often you can find it here's an

673
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
example just using some dorking we we

674
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
went and find this what this guy was was

675
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
sending we have this map that shows like

676
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,039
from all the different compromises that

677
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,320
come out

678
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
and the clarification of why i play this

679
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
this individual in here is because even

680
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,440
though i mean there is clearly like a

681
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
capability of doing different hacks and

682
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
what not

683
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,559
uh normally the estimation of the impact

684
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,720
or what it is is quite

685
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
different from reality

686
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,720
so whenever we see these uh

687
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
accounts posting something they might

688
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
say i had access to scada systems uh and

689
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
what they actually had access to is

690
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
maybe a sql database or maybe the

691
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
backend for websites and then you

692
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
actually go validate and you see that

693
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
actually you know the product that's

694
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,159
being sold has a very big difference

695
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,799
from what is being claimed yet very

696
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
prolific

697
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,159
this one is uh even cooler

698
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,520
this is

699
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,039
actually

700
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,320
um a specific group of actors they

701
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
shared this control they said it's uh

702
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,600
it's a control for a german train and it

703
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
was for a german but for a german model

704
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
train

705
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,440
so

706
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
it's very funny because i mean of course

707
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,200
to be fair to be entirely fair when you

708
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
look at the human machine interfaces

709
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
from a couple minutes ago they do look

710
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,799
like video games from the 80s right i

711
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,320
mean normally they are not made to be

712
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
beautiful they are made to be useful

713
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,440
they are made with an engineering

714
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
mindset that says this is how the

715
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,520
diagram looks it has to be useful you

716
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,880
have to understand the engineer that's

717
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
all

718
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
so you know you see this

719
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,280
i could see in some dimension it might

720
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
control train but actually if you see

721
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,320
the two small trains might have given a

722
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,559
hint what we do is just reverse image

723
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
lookup and then that's how we connect to

724
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
what it actually was

725
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,159
and then the final example of this is uh

726
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,159
this is the most the most one of the

727
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
newest ones that we we've seen

728
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,559
uh this actor is actually interested in

729
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,720
pull it's trying to push some political

730
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
messages not actually this is more

731
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,159
within a country this is something more

732
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,559
specific very interesting case

733
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,320
um and what they started doing is just

734
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
pulling all these ip addresses from

735
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,159
internet connected assets

736
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,720
and then they go they push them they

737
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
give you a list of what it is you know

738
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
like kind of like like looking it is

739
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
it's very interesting

740
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
but a couple of those were kind of funny

741
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
this one is the most interesting one

742
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
that it says it's a refinery

743
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
uh as you can see there i mean it has

744
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,679
the ip address i just blanked it for

745
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,559
obvious reasons mentions their port 5900

746
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,960
which is the bnc which are these

747
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
connections these remote connections for

748
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
the for viewing

749
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
and uh there

750
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,720
when we actually went to look what it

751
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
was and we started doing some research

752
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,320
we go into this website that is

753
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
basically a farming system so from our

754
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
refinery it's actually a feeder

755
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
uh i mean in this case we knew it was

756
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
for pigs but it could be for horses cows

757
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
you know in case you you're in in need

758
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,039
of one

759
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,760
um and yeah so those were examples of

760
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,919
where you know they have gone with some

761
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
some random funny funny choices

762
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
um

763
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
but yeah so

764
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
let's talk right now a bit about like

765
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
nailing down how to say like like your

766
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
own findings it's like okay i discuss a

767
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
lot of what they're doing how it works

768
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
uh as i mentioned this is super simple

769
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
so uh

770
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
like i can share some some of the simple

771
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
ideas basically what they are doing uh

772
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
in case you ever want to experiment and

773
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
just highlighting this experiment as

774
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
long as you do it in a non-harmful way

775
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,919
and you notify the individual might be

776
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,520
actually fairly useful from a security

777
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,000
perspective

778
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
so for this you know like super quick

779
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,279
walkthrough this is a five-minute

780
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
walkthrough that

781
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,799
that i brought up it just i went to look

782
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,440
for this um alert it happened in the

783
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
beginning of the when it was a ukraine

784
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,440
conflict i i don't know if it was tied

785
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,240
or something it's u.s government but

786
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
they share this and they say there are

787
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,480
ups devices it's basically what you use

788
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,159
when the power goes out you know it

789
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,320
comes it can be as simple as what you

790
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,760
have in your computer in your house but

791
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
it can be also as complex as what they

792
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,520
have in a engineering facility or

793
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,799
whatnot right

794
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
and basically um

795
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,559
well basically what this alert said is

796
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
like we found some connected to internet

797
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
there were some compromises someone

798
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,159
reported to us please disconnect them uh

799
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,120
you know

800
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
i highlight this solution because it's

801
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
great it's just like we found them so

802
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
please disconnect them solution it's an

803
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,760
easy solution but

804
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,679
um

805
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,279
so i mean if if you're interested in

806
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,279
following up on this for example just go

807
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,880
and check the first thing i would call

808
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,480
i'm like like the thought process would

809
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,520
be to actually look into ups

810
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,880
ups is something that you might be more

811
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
familiar with but would you go into the

812
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,240
engineering processes it can be super

813
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,320
specific so my suggestion is always

814
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,840
looking into that specific engineering

815
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,880
process

816
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
learning a bit about what it does like

817
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,000
in the first image if they had looked at

818
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
damper and then you feel what the damper

819
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,919
is then you see it's a docked then you

820
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,840
see the dock can be connected to

821
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,520
where it's used and that's how you start

822
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,679
connecting what they're actually doing

823
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,679
in this case uh the first things

824
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,919
immediately bring ups the most common

825
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,840
was apc so i decided to go to go for

826
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
that and in netherlands because we were

827
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,559
here

828
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,640
uh amherst ford is very close so i just

829
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,000
said okay let's see what they have in

830
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,360
amherst fort

831
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,480
um and then this is how how the actor

832
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
these these actors could have verified

833
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,440
uh by taking a couple minutes and

834
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
looking at all the banners and this is

835
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,799
also what helps you go and do more

836
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,120
interesting searches if you go

837
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,279
because all of these uh search engines

838
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,799
what they do is actually go and look

839
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,559
into the banners and then from there you

840
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
actually query and then from there you

841
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,679
actually start seeing what actually you

842
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,679
can have access to

843
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,960
so yeah in this case i mean you get the

844
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
model you get the firmware if you wanted

845
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
to check for vulnerabilities for example

846
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,720
you get an image what it is and in this

847
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
case it was from a small store

848
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
we're not going to bother them

849
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
but um yeah

850
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
if you see however there are other more

851
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,200
interesting as i said this is just a

852
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
very quick exercise just like let's show

853
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
you a bit like the logic really not not

854
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,440
much more than that

855
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
if you want to see other type of things

856
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
that are compromised this is for ip

857
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,279
cameras and i added 200 okay so that we

858
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,640
see all only the ones that we can

859
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
actually like reach out to they might

860
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
still have password but you can also add

861
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
other filters of course as long as

862
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
they're in the in the banners

863
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,679
and this is the amount of cameras that

864
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,000
were exposed now in in specifically

865
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
netherlands now the point is i highlight

866
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,000
this is 22 and before there's no data

867
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,039
this might be something about the

868
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
platform the provider it doesn't mean

869
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
that there were no cameras and suddenly

870
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,799
everyone added them in 2022

871
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:19,840
so

872
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
um

873
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,600
given that this is just like a very

874
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,559
simple

875
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,320
type of not really tutorial but you're

876
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,240
like like walking through the logic if

877
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
you want more then i can share some of

878
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
the hacktivist ones because those guys

879
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
actually do get more specific right

880
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,120
this is a specific one all of them say

881
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
the same that's also something

882
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,159
interesting so it's either they're like

883
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,760
sharing from one or learning from each

884
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,840
other and every time one learns the

885
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,919
other the other guys start catching up

886
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
so this first one what i had interesting

887
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
is just that actually it adds that

888
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,360
description of like let's look into the

889
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
process what it does and specifically

890
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
they show how to find this gas liquid

891
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
system using one of the platforms that i

892
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,120
was mentioning

893
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,399
and this one actually was interesting

894
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,399
because it was uh well

895
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,600
yeah probably

896
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,120
i know some people here might be able to

897
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
read this not me but it was specifically

898
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
from um in greek

899
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
and they were actually asking to go and

900
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,159
attack any turkish type of systems so

901
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,520
that's the reason why they're they're

902
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,760
sharing this

903
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
this is another one this one didn't have

904
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
a specific target but it was i thought

905
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
it was good to just enumerate it much

906
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,520
easier and basically as simple as

907
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
how they how they do it they share a

908
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,080
specific free service ultra bnc

909
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,679
you go to in this case they decide to

910
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
show that we could be showdown senses or

911
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,720
whatever

912
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
you go you add your query for what

913
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,679
you're searching for these guys

914
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,120
specifically tell you already for b and

915
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
c specifically for machine interfaces

916
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,039
that are connected uh that's why they

917
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,720
provide all the way the the ports in

918
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,520
there

919
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
and then uh copy the ips paste them in

920
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,120
ultrabnc and then you're going to see

921
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
all your hmis

922
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
that is

923
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
the easiest way that you can go and do

924
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,360
this this scans massively uh again

925
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
i would i would suggest that if you do

926
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
this just don't go and poke anything in

927
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,960
there uh it's better to just go and

928
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
notify um because yeah there's there's a

929
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,279
ton of a ton of vendors that are still

930
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,840
doing this

931
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
and then of course we have researchers

932
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,760
like beyond the the the tool how to

933
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,279
learn about this you can also just go

934
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,559
and look at some some of the research

935
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
that has been done

936
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
actually all of these platforms they

937
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
they were discussed for in control

938
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,640
systems world for prices 2010 11 blah

939
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,880
blah so right now actually everyone in

940
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
that group is already like super

941
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,919
familiar it's kind of like a daily type

942
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,360
of tooling

943
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,200
and well you can go directly to

944
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,960
platforms offer some of these guidance

945
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
they tell you what to look for how to

946
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,000
look for it

947
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
um you can go

948
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
for example this this

949
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
video that you have here is a video from

950
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,120
a researcher that just went and

951
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
automated the same process that that all

952
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,520
the researchers that the activists were

953
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,480
doing with um with ultra bnc

954
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
and then the last one is something that

955
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
really impressed me i just found it

956
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,000
recently but it's actually um a security

957
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,279
researcher

958
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
that published this

959
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
guidance a couple days ago and it's like

960
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
go and find all the vulnerable uh sites

961
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
of this country

962
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
so that's why i mentioned kind of like

963
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,039
like you know like the nuances between

964
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,000
research and activism

965
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
more in researchers these are actually

966
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,799
just

967
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,840
some

968
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,960
small group

969
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
i believe they were students it's it's a

970
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
bit unclear

971
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
but basically they just built this

972
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
script to go and find what's called tank

973
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,799
gorges

974
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,159
which is basically when you have for

975
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,399
example a gas tank or a water tank it

976
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
measures the amount of liquid you have

977
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,840
and it measures the temperature it

978
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,399
measures the pressure and it basically

979
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,840
you can also you know like change the

980
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
amounts that it has of different

981
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,559
different liquids

982
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,080
then all the tools we've shown them

983
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,279
quite a lot

984
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,080
and no tools the last the last uh tip

985
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,399
that i have

986
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,039
okay i'm not gonna do that

987
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,279
and then the last tip that they have is

988
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,440
uh yeah basically you can just literally

989
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
go to google and as long as you know

990
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
what to look for

991
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
this is a specific type of controllers

992
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
for example as long as you know what the

993
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
controllers are going to bring back it's

994
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,880
fairly easy to go and find them

995
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:08,720
so

996
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,960
to grab this up uh the

997
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,320
last thing that i want to bring i think

998
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,600
it's going to be a bit quicker than

999
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,080
expected um what i really wanted to

1000
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
bring in here is is the the discussion

1001
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,519
right like like the cases are super fun

1002
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,960
they are interesting it's good to see

1003
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
what's going on

1004
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
but the most important thing here is is

1005
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,200
the implications uh and this is actually

1006
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,720
interesting because in in the world of

1007
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,159
control systems

1008
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,000
most people

1009
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
saw this as i don't care it's not

1010
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,000
relevant i mean it's very you know it's

1011
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,760
difficult it's never going to grow

1012
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
and then it started growing and if we

1013
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
see it from an i.t perspective it's not

1014
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,600
a sexy topic because you know like the

1015
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,519
compromises are so simple

1016
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,200
that some people if they even want to

1017
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,320
talk about this would be like oh you

1018
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,240
know how do i talk about this it was an

1019
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,159
internet like yeah but they need to have

1020
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,080
it there because it's part of their

1021
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
process and assuming that it's going to

1022
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,440
keep on being there

1023
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,360
then what can we do about it if you have

1024
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,440
any ideas if you have any research for

1025
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,679
finding this for how to help the

1026
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
organizations mainly when they have less

1027
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,000
resourcing to go and protect the systems

1028
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,760
it would be actually something very

1029
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,240
impactful

1030
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,039
so the big question here was is this

1031
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,279
actually a risk uh you know for cyber

1032
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,880
physical systems for for for the

1033
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
applications for what we're using

1034
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
and then we have a couple of things in

1035
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,039
here and the first one is

1036
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,559
yes in the sense that it gives

1037
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
opportunities for people to learn about

1038
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
how to how to access these systems what

1039
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,279
we saw five years ago was much more

1040
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
simple that one we're seeing what you

1041
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
saw what we saw last week about the

1042
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,480
iranian steel facility what we saw in

1043
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,720
florida are cases that are getting a bit

1044
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,679
you know

1045
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
across the line into being funny to

1046
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,760
actually being something that you know

1047
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,360
is impactful

1048
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,039
the second thing is uh in terms of

1049
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,399
intrusions the more they are the more

1050
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,559
impactful just another thing we have to

1051
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,120
worry about no one wants that

1052
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,200
and then the third and last one is the

1053
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
publicity and this is actually my

1054
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,200
favorite thing in here uh in terms of

1055
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
discussion which is

1056
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
this encourages other actors to do it

1057
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,679
because no one is actually caring and no

1058
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,839
one's actually doing anything to stop it

1059
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,440
if you have a ransomware gang and they

1060
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,679
go and they deploy ransom and then you

1061
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,879
know the

1062
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,280
ex-government finds them goes and stops

1063
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,760
them that is one thing but if you go and

1064
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,359
poke into one of these systems no one's

1065
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,960
going to look for you no one's going to

1066
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,440
do anything at you they don't care

1067
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,280
so that is a big big point because if it

1068
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
becomes something that is not relevant

1069
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,839
then

1070
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,800
you know

1071
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,480
ironically it becomes relevant

1072
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
so

1073
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,800
someone is actually noticing this

1074
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,879
besides from the actual actors engaging

1075
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,399
in this we said from the activists and

1076
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,280
whatnot

1077
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,918
and it is actually government which is a

1078
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,520
very scary thing

1079
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,159
this image is israel is from a from an

1080
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,399
article that that also with with

1081
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,800
mandiant they were they were analyzing

1082
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,119
and it was a document that was leaked of

1083
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,560
um

1084
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,960
a specific plan

1085
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
attributed to possibly government of

1086
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,160
iran

1087
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
uh well not not specifically the

1088
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
government but it's believed that the

1089
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
idea that there were some relations and

1090
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,160
it seemed that it was a firm just doing

1091
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,079
some um

1092
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,920
as they say consulting and what they did

1093
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
is a full research of what you just saw

1094
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
presented right now

1095
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
and they were saying what can you do if

1096
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,800
you go and use these tools and what can

1097
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
you find that is exposed how can you go

1098
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,720
and attack it and this image actually is

1099
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,400
literally the same type of research what

1100
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,240
what has been argued on the research

1101
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
perspective is that for example if you

1102
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
go and modify some of the systems that

1103
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,280
define how much cargo there are in the

1104
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,359
sides of the of the ship then you can

1105
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,839
make a ship go to the side and

1106
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,960
eventually trip you know this is a

1107
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,800
research it has never happened but but

1108
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,480
that's the point that's a type of uh

1109
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,839
basically some people are taking this

1110
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,000
research very seriously and therefore it

1111
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,599
can become much more impactful

1112
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,320
but uh to close this the good news the

1113
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,680
good thing the bright side is you know

1114
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,520
to finish on a cozy note

1115
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
is that so far we haven't seen any big

1116
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,160
physical impact uh the closest we had is

1117
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,320
that case from from from a couple weeks

1118
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
ago so actually this slide was there

1119
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
before two weeks ago so now probably we

1120
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
have we don't know yet

1121
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,240
uh but most often if there is little

1122
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,839
risk of impact most often it has been

1123
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
just you know minor compromises i hope

1124
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,640
no one of you has lost your power or the

1125
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
light or anything because of this

1126
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
and at least we have some time to to

1127
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,640
start thinking about it and see

1128
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
what we can do about it and yeah i mean

1129
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
if anyone of you gets more interested

1130
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,839
please feel free to reach out we'll be

1131
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
super happy to have more more heads

1132
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,760
looking at this problem

1133
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,040
and that's all from my side thank you

1134
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,119
uh i hope you find this useful

1135
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,280
and yeah that's all for myself

1136
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
so we've got time for a few questions um

1137
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,280
does anyone have any questions

1138
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
i've got one actually um

1139
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,400
whose responsibility do you see it being

1140
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,119
to

1141
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,640
fix the problem do you see it as being

1142
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,280
the manufacturers or the people who

1143
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,119
deploy these different systems to secure

1144
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,160
them

1145
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,800
well there's uh many different responses

1146
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
to that actually

1147
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,839
first of all there are there is work

1148
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,920
that is being doing is being done by the

1149
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
manufacturers because before security

1150
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
for control systems was treated as

1151
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
something that

1152
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,680
you can't have access you can't have

1153
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
visibility to it so you don't need it

1154
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
and recently it's becoming something

1155
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,040
more of um

1156
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
you know you actually need to do it from

1157
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
design so there are some organizations

1158
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
trying to work right now on how to

1159
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
incorporate that in the descent process

1160
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
of engineering building different

1161
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
frameworks

1162
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
then it's also the user the problem is

1163
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,839
that oftentimes there are organizations

1164
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,200
that have no

1165
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
no real budget for security uh in which

1166
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,359
case you know if it's a very small

1167
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,800
organization they're not even going to

1168
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
think about this but it's definitely the

1169
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
responsibility and on the security side
