00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
it's still good still places still seats

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
available

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,840
right

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,399

pre-ordered merch please pick it up at

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
the merge shop over there

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
um because otherwise it would get sold

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
to somebody else who hasn't pre-ordered

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
i mean they are probably happy about it

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
but you won't

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
also

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
unfortunately there's no seating on the

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
sitting on the floor even at the back so

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
please find yourself

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,319
a chair there's plenty available

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,239
even up at the front with a good sight

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
of everyone

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
let me guess

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,000
to

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
apply sunscreen so that the rain is is

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,599
dropping off your body more easily

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,399
that's also a good idea

78
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,940

well in 2014

175
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
i was

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
24

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
i got my master's degree in

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
software engineering and i was already

179
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,080
working

180
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,120
right so i was not expecting the war

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,319
and suddenly my whole career afterwards

182
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
it was all related to the war

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
right so every young professional as

184
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,240
someone who works in software i didn't

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,879
have a chance to enjoy peaceful life

186
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
that's all

187
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
and

188
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
i didn't give

189
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
i'm not in here right now but i live in

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
cave in the capital of ukraine and since

191
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
2014

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
we got really a lot of

193
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,039
people moving from the east

194
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,919
parts of ukraine to kiev to capital

195
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,719
people rebuilding their lives

196
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
right and a lot of my colleagues are

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
from the east parts of ukraine

198
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,958
and that war in 2014 in fact it affected

199
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,360
everyone even if

200
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
the shelling was located in the east it

201
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
was felt everywhere everywhere across

202
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
ukraine

203
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
um what about

204
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
what about you personally um

205
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
would you be willing to share um

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
some examples from your personal life

207
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
how that affected you

208
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,279
i don't know how you feel about um

209
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
young woman but instead of buying

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
dresses and things like that i was

211
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
buying military equipment

212
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
because in 2014 we already have the

213
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,200
strong negative movement and i would buy

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
a lot of things i never thought i would

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,560
be buying and i got up to speed with

216
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,760
all this shooting with first aid with

217
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
anthony turns but what to do in case of

218
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
terrorist attacks and things like that

219
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
so i just you know um

220
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,240
personally i think

221
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
most part of my

222
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
conscious adult life is connected with

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,750
the war

224
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,240
[Music]

225
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,730
in one way or another

226
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,959
[Music]

227
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
right and i remember after a couple of

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,399
years living in ukraine i went to

229
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,200
um

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
little i guess and i seen fireworks

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,360
and i was super scared

232
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
and again i was living in kiev in the

233
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
capital so without all the challenges

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
but right now in 2022 i don't know if i

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
will be enjoying fireworks ever in my

236
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,640
life

237
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
like ever because

238
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,399
i don't like loud sounds there was a

239
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
thunderstorm here two days ago and it

240
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
was quite scary because of sounds so

241
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
yeah

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
personally i think our ingredients are

243
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,640
affected since 2014 and your night this

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,360
is

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,440
ninth year and right now it's uh five

246
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
months

247
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
and one day of the full-scale invasion

248
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
recalculates every day

249
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,600
thank you

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,880
um

251
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
the cyber

252
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,560
front was also not static for the past

253
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,839
nine years

254
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
cyber activities were there

255
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,279
from 2014 onwards so um i'd like the

256
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,320
panelists to check on

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
chime in on not petya black energy

258
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
all the other

259
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
activities that the

260
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
russian hackers were

261
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
conducting

262
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,720
if we could start by outlining what it

263
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
is i'm sure that nine years

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
is a long time for

265
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
for some of you some of you are around

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
18 here right so

267
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
you may not be aware of the attacks

268
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
maybe we can have a panelist that can

269
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
outline that

270
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
anastasia would be able to do that for

271
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,279
us

272
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,079
just a couple words about what not petya

273
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,719
is technically what's uh black energy

274
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,839
yeah these are one of the named

275
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,279
cyber attacks to the critical

276
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,519
infrastructure in ukraine and then over

277
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
the world

278
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
these are only ones i mean

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
i'm sure there are more of them but

280
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
these examples are well

281
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
studied and there are books about them

282
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
there are wikipedia articles basically

283
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
black energy and then later beta lots

284
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,320
pizza uh like um

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,959
critical infrastructure malware

286
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,000
kind of things that affected short uh

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
political infrastructure in ukraine

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
especially black energy we had some kind

289
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,160
of blackouts or brown out how they call

290
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
it and then um

291
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,519
database has affected

292
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,839
a lot of enterprise companies all around

293
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,959
the world

294
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,360
i think if you don't know about that i

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
really really recommend you reading

296
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
a book

297
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,720
about sandborn

298
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah yeah

299
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,560
so it's interesting how um

300
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
not petty initially masqueraded as a

301
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,440
ransomware right but it turned out to be

302
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
a government malware destructive malware

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,519
that they had no intention of collecting

304
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,959
any money from the victims they just

305
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,079
wanted to

306
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
damage certain sectors in ukraine

307
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
um

308
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
peter

309
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
may i ask you to tell us briefly uh

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839
about your life before the 24th of uh

311
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,160
february

312
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,180
how far do you want to go on that one

313
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,399
[Laughter]

314
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,800
yeah let me start first for where my

315
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
journey regarding ukraine's uh began um

316
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,720
i think it's already 2013 the end of

317
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
2013 beginning of 2014

318
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
where you see courageous young people

319
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
taking faith into their own hands and

320
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
go out for a protest against her

321
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
at that moment current president who has

322
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
to sign an association agreement with

323
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,519
the european union

324
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
i was touched by that

325
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,839
you see young people

326
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,440
fighting for something that we here in

327
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
the rest of europe take for granted and

328
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,120
that is freedom and that this

329
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
destination

330
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,639
that is

331
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,720
more or less fair leadership uh

332
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,839
democracy which wasn't the case back in

333
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
2014 in ukraine

334
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
so i was touched by that and

335
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
i started digging into what is going on

336
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,240
there because i have to be honest i knew

337
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,839
little about ukraine

338
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,519
only the fact that we had a foundation

339
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
in our small village that take foster

340
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
children over for the summer vacation

341
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
and stuff like that

342
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
but that's it that's all i knew about

343
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,040
ukraine

344
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,320
and then of course in 2014 uh a really

345
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,800
terrible disaster uh hit dutch society

346
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,720
as well uh 298 people died in a really

347
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,959
coward action of what i consider to be

348
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
uh yeah it's clear really clear that

349
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
russian army was

350
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
um behind this attack

351
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
um

352
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,199
and

353
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,440
yeah of course there is a race inside

354
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
you and then

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
you know already that there is a war

356
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
going on but now it comes really close

357
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,959
it's started getting innocent people and

358
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
that yeah are just flying over a country

359
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
so that's a fear the race and um yeah

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,320
then you see in 2015 2016

361
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
uh discussed it with chris as well and

362
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
an uprise of what i call a pro

363
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
russian narrative on what i think

364
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
this doesn't fit into dutch society you

365
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
see certain movements within dutch

366
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,480
society uh getting fueled up you see a

367
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,279
certain narrative getting into the media

368
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
and that's for me where i started to get

369
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
dig into this and get into dig into this

370
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,759
topic

371
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
what actors are involved how do

372
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
they hold up to each other and then in

373
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,079
2016 we had the referendum in the

374
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,680
netherlands about the association

375
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
agreement in ukraine

376
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
um yeah from that moment on uh i was

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
actively involved with a couple of other

378
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,800
people

379
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
gathering information about certain

380
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
things that happen here

381
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
and yeah and

382
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,360
till now i'm involved in that kind of uh

383
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
stuff and

384
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
um

385
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
yeah and since 2018 and that's where i

386
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,800
met on the social as well i'm attending

387
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,519
to the no namecon conference in ukraine

388
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
because i have a strong belief that

389
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
we should at

390
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
foremost and even back then

391
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
support ukraine on the pathway getting

392
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
into the european union and

393
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
from a cyber atmosphere i try to

394
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
be kind of like an ambassador or

395
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
whatever you want to call it uh but

396
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,759
intermediate air

397
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,560
and to to to make the community here and

398
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,399
they're aware of each other and of each

399
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,079
other capabilities

400
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
and yeah that's a short brief until then

401
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,920
yeah thank you thank you for that we'll

402
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
we'll certainly take a minute near the

403
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,440
end of the panel to talk about uh eu

404
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
ukraine corporation and nato

405
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,279
ukraine cooperation as well

406
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,800
but to

407
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,240
move on talking about the cyber front we

408
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
first need to answer a really simple

409
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,839
question honestly i'd like to ask you

410
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
the question so uh because you are the

411
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,839
best person to answer that how

412
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
digitalized is ukraine because many

413
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
people aren't aware do you have digital

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
services how advanced they are how long

415
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,919
have you had them

416
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,319
oh actually it's a good test uh for

417
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,559
ukrainians because many people

418
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,760
um

419
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
like you know since 2007

420
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
i guess ukrainians can go visa-free to

421
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
schengen area and many countries of

422
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,559
european union so they could they can

423
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,360
compare really easily and

424
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,760
a lot of feedback what they have and i

425
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
hear is that ukrainian digital services

426
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,679
are really really sophisticated compared

427
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,799
to some countries in european union so

428
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
we have everything this is like okay not

429
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
everything not maybe the level of

430
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
estonia but a lot of things are digital

431
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
uh we do have this dia application you

432
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
probably heard about that this is a mega

433
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
application of ukrainian government that

434
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,520
allows to have in one application your

435
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,400
id

436
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
like a passport id your driver license

437
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
your commit certificates

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
uh recently they started doing

439
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
e-voting kind of polls in this

440
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
application asking people

441
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
opinion on guns control and things like

442
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
that right so this is the main

443
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
application that allows you to

444
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,160
to move in ukraine without your id card

445
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
or without your passport because you

446
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,559
have a mobile app for that

447
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
um then we do have

448
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,799
all banks have uh their applications and

449
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,000
things like like venmo kinda things are

450
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
very popular so you can

451
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
send money to other people accounts in

452
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,919
in the blink of an eye right it takes

453
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,640
like seconds literally uh applications

454
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
like monobank allow you to get together

455
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,320
shake

456
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
your app and send money again it's it's

457
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
not like some kind of new things they're

458
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,039
just super

459
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,480
spread out

460
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,080
right in many many shops uh you can find

461
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
you can pay with a paypal

462
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,200
so i just use typically i use my apple

463
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
watch and this is all i need to pay for

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
something

465
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
all the tickets everything can be bought

466
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,120
online

467
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
so

468
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,120
typically you don't need to have you

469
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
know a lot of papers with you and i i

470
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,240
read this joke in twitter which is not a

471
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
joke

472
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
you know about aerated syrians

473
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,200
so when russia launch missiles

474
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,600
we receive an air raid syrian which is

475
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
which we call trivoga

476
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
trivago means like emergency some kind

477
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
of uh and there is a map digital map of

478
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
ukraine with regions and those regions

479
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,559
become like red

480
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,799
because the air raid syrians are owned

481
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
in this region so depending where

482
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,280
russians send their missiles to

483
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
different regions become red and yeah if

484
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
you watch the map you see it's changing

485
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,360
from red to

486
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
green again so

487
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
the the application for airaid syrians

488
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,960
was built on february 25th

489
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,400
it was available in all the app stores

490
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,159
uh and it's widely spread

491
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,559
and a couple of days later

492
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,440
the

493
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
delivery services like foods delivery

494
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
services got synchronized with this

495
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
application

496
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
so if you are

497
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
ordering food

498
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,039
from kfc for example

499
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,600
and there is a rate syrians ran in your

500
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,559
city

501
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,280
your delivery will be posed

502
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
during syrian and then depending on the

503
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
states either you will get money back or

504
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
their career will arise a little bit

505
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
later after air insurance so we are

506
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
talking about this kind of

507
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
digital life here

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,919
and of course uh when many services are

509
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,559
digitalized everything can be broken

510
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,440
right and this is why we're here

511
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
yeah but that is an amazing example not

512
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
only of the digitalization and using

513
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
technology to to actually

514
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,000
uh survive and and

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,720
uh try try your best to live normally

516
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
during such situation it's also a great

517
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,799
example of fast response so

518
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
one one day after after the missiles hit

519
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
you had the app that's

520
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
that's impressive

521
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
um chris i understand

522
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
that you were already busy helping

523
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
ukraine before the 24th of february can

524
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
you tell us more about that

525
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,159
uh certainly so part of my background is

526
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,320
i've dealt with uh

527
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,600
one too many nuclear cyber attacks

528
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,880
and

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,559
one of the things i was asked to do was

530
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,360
there was a fear that one of either

531
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
in production or decommissioned

532
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
nuclear facilities would get hit by a

533
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,039
cyber attack

534
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
uh one of which uh

535
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,799
uh in chernobyl uh this had happened

536
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,520
before someone was able to hack the

537
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
radiation sensor that showed online and

538
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,000
this was back in

539
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
2018

540
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,440
pushing a false reading up

541
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,919
so those types of things can cause panic

542
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,919
not only that but obviously if you're

543
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
hitting a in production

544
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,799
control system that's attached to a

545
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,080
nuclear facility so i ended up catching

546
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,400
the very last air france flight in on

547
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
the 20th uh all the rest of my flights

548
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,280
were canceled especially after the

549
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
airport was kind of destroyed

550
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
um so i got to

551
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
see some of the

552
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
cyber buildup and what was going on

553
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,600
so

554
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,760
a bunch of atm machines and banking

555
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,039
logins

556
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,320
didn't function the way they were

557
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
supposed to be

558
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,000
some were intermittent some were denied

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,120
service for a while

560
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
there were also hits against government

561
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
websites in ukraine

562
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,679
and

563
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
while they were getting hit uh when i

564
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
would hit refresh over and over again i

565
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
would also notice that a bunch of them

566
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,159
started switching to cloudflare very

567
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,679
very quickly

568
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,640
so by the 21st 22nd a bunch of

569
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
government sites were then on cloudflare

570
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
luckily

571
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,799
there was also a cyberattack in luhansk

572
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,360
against the water infrastructure

573
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
which the russians tried to turn around

574
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,200
and use against ukrainians saying look

575
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
at what they're doing to our people in

576
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,520
luhansk when it was absolutely untrue so

577
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
there were a lot of these like kind of

578
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
false flag kind of events but also

579
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,919
related to cyber attacks i mean why

580
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
would ukraine want to take out all the

581
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
water and luhans there's no reason for

582
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
it

583
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
um but you know media spends things

584
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,919
there were also uh interruptions in some

585
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
of the ukrainian apps

586
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,799
and that was starting to happen right

587
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,840
before the first bomb started to drop

588
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
one thing to understand is some of these

589
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,640
effects

590
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,600
if

591
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
you want to buy something how many of

592
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
you have cash on you right now can i

593
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
have a show of hands how many of you

594
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,039
have more than 200 euros on you cash

595
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,950
really i swear to god i won't rob you

596
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,920
[Laughter]

597
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
the reason i asked that is if you can

598
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,240
suddenly you can't take money out of an

599
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,559
atm machine or your google pay is

600
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,880
disrupted or your regular

601
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
way of paying is disrupted and you

602
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
suddenly have to flee

603
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
because there's shellings you can see

604
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
paratroopers in the sky you hear about

605
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,600
columns of tanks

606
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
you kind of need cash

607
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
especially when the russians were

608
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
starting to disrupt internet service

609
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
and you're hosed if you don't have a

610
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,279
bunch of cash right so it's a

611
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,600
psychological thing where people start

612
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,520
fearing what's going to happen if

613
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,159
something really does

614
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,200
so it's very upsetting

615
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
and it's something to think about

616
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
so these things started building up and

617
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,559
it was very funny where when some of the

618
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,919
cyber attacks started to hit as well as

619
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,600
one of the first

620
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
series of wiper attacks uh most

621
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
ukrainians in kiev that i spoke to were

622
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,559
like oh yeah it's all cyber we don't

623
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,320
expect our electricity to stay on

624
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,440
tonight because it was just expected

625
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,799
that there would be cyber attacks

626
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,960
against infrastructure

627
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
so that's how

628
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,880
normalized to a certain extent things

629
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
had become when it shouldn't have been

630
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,240
you know this is one of the problems

631
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,919
where this war has been going on for

632
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
quite some time and it's become so

633
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,400
normalized uh so um i ended up having a

634
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,159
very interesting experience i was in the

635
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,440
capitol uh at the hotel that most of the

636
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,279
international journalists were at the

637
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,039
intercontinental

638
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,919
so i got over beers lots of additional

639
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,000
information and and things of that

640
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,919
nature that i might not have gotten

641
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,200
elsewhere

642
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
and uh when on the 23rd

643
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,320
we had received a pentagon briefing uh

644
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,640
saying that the pentagon thought that

645
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,360
shelling would begin at 4 00 a.m

646
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
and of course that's the last thing you

647
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
want to hear when you're in a capital

648
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,200
city

649
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,320
uh

650
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
and you're hoping hey you know there's

651
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
just been a lot of media maybe it won't

652
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,480
happen maybe it's you know what have you

653
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,919
because nobody really wants to get

654
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,880
shelled

655
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
uh instead on the 24th at 4 am everybody

656
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
got woken up and i must add

657
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
since uh the build up from monday the

658
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,640
21st most people

659
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
really weren't sleeping

660
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,919
because things were already coming over

661
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,039
the east

662
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
so here you're surviving on no sleep

663
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
you're thinking oh i just want to get a

664
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,520
little sleep and then boom

665
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
and uh it's it's not a pleasant thing

666
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,440
you know how many of you have woken up

667
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,080
to a fire alarm

668
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
a few now imagine a fire alarm times a

669
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,600
million because

670
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
you've just heard uh shelling and you go

671
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
to look out your window and the sun's

672
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
starting to come up a little bit you can

673
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
already see columns of smoke

674
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,000
um

675
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
so this was just not a pleasant

676
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
experience uh so i hope i i set the

677
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,919
stage uh between me and anastasia of how

678
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,880
it was

679
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,159

morning what did you do can you walk us

689
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
through through your

690
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,840
time

691
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,240
then first of all i totally agree with

692
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,559
chris and news

693
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,279
were very disturbing for a couple of

694
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,000
days already right and you remember the

695
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
news about

696
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,559
that russians will attack in february 16

697
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
which didn't happen

698
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,640
so everyone was like relaxed for a day

699
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
but then again you started falling up

700
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,240
and yeah many people didn't have enough

701
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,919
sleep uh and we were like

702
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,039
it's it's some kind of very

703
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,799
anxious and disturbing

704
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,200
expectations of something you really

705
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,120
really really don't want to happen

706
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,880
and part of your

707
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,960
when the consciousness understand that

708
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,840
there are real risk but another part

709
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,799
really tries tries its best

710
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,880
not to think about it

711
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
you know what i mean

712
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,320
and

713
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,080
on february 23 i was working and i seen

714
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240

and i got back at home and i continued

716
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,159
working

717
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,880
uh because the news were pretty

718
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
disturbing so i didn't i wasn't feeling

719
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,600

723
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
and

724
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
i ended up like near 2 a.m or something

725
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480

728
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,640
i

729
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
um

730
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
i got into my pajamas

731
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
and i tried to sleep but i was scrolling

732
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,200
twitter i was really news

733
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
and it didn't actually help because at

734
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,480
some point they closed the um the air

735
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
um

736
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,600
the airplane space

737
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
above ukraine and this was a sign we

738
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,760

739
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,240
sign of disaster this is a sign of plane

this is a sign of shelling this is a

741
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,520
sign of missiles so after this news i

742
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
was like okay it looks like something

743
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,039
will happen

744
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,240
tonight

745
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,520
and i didn't catch any any sleep at all

746
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
on some point again i was reading news

747
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,240
and i seen this

748
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,159

749
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,039
and putting saying something something

750
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,200
and then my twitter feed

751
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,159
start saying that hey putin has declared

752
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,320

753
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
and i was like well maybe it's someone

754
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,720
overreacting

755
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,480
but then this news continued to you know

756
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,399
the same news continued to repeat and i

757
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,880
was like okay

758
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,799

and i got from the bed

762
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200

763
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
finish packing my bag

764
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
because my bag was already pre-packed

765
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,480
because for months months before

766
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,600

767
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,640
all ukrainian media they were sharing

768
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,679
the stories how to pack your panic bag

769
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,840
what do you need to have as a first aid

770
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,600
kit how to make sure that your shelters

771
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,039

772
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
water do you need and things like that

773
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,559
right so it was not like out of the blue

774
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,960
so i decided to finish up to finish back

775
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
in my beds

776
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,720

780
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
and first i was like well maybe it was

781
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159

783
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,399

784
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,120

785
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,679

in hours and the city was jammed and

806
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,320
then people who uh were trying to leave

807
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,039
later in the morning around eight or

808

809
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
could spend hours trying to get from the

810
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,200
city kiev is a huge city it has like

811
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
four million people

813
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,720
including all the agglomeration and it's

814
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
situated in two banks of the river so

815
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,120
people who are trying to escape from

816
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880

hours in traffic jams in case

818
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,559
right so i told my mom to go and it was

819
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,799
a wise decision

820
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,840
and then

821
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,960

849
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,679
people are driving away millions right

850
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
they wrote a gem as well and we were

851
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,199
trying to find roots not so jammed at

852
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,000
the same time we have this column of

853
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,520
cars we cannot just you know

854
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,199
drive away we need to stay as a group

855
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,839
so in many cases we

856
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
took safest route instead of the

857
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,679
quickest route

858
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,560
and one of this decision led us into

859
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,879
staying a traffic jam

860
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,440
for 12 hours

861
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
since nine in the evening

862
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
to nine in the morning on the next day

863
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
we slept in the cars in a field

864
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,599
end of february it was not very warm

865
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,680
let's put it this way

866
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,480
uh but then we successfully moved to two

867
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
locations we wanted to move and again

868
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,839
divided our groups and we start working

869
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,960
on february 25 because as a security

870
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,320
engineers we are involved into

871
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
supporting some kind of critical

872
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
infrastructure

873
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,359
and first-ever group was working on on

874
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,520
february 25th and they didn't have any

875
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,640
weekends

876
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
through march

877
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,520
our second group my group uh we went to

878
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,079
the mountains so ukraine is a huge

879
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,160
country and it has mountains republican

880
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
mountains we went to the carpathian

881
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
mountains we find some kind of

882
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,760
hotel we created we spent weekends

883
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
building up the infrastructure satellite

884
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,359
internet

885
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,839
all these you know internal rotors and

886
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,880
things we need and we on monday monday

887
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,960
february 28th we were working as well

888
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
and when i say working i don't

889
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
necessarily mean working on commercial

890
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
projects as a company which we continued

891
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
but also doing

892
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
working in terms of doing a lot of

893
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,480
um

894
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,960
sudden health

895
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
insecurity for other companies that

896
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,839
become target of cyber attacks

897
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,680
that needed to help with the data

898
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,880
security and then we were involved in

899
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
many

900
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,760
military related volunteering activities

901
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,839
and we stayed in this we are still in

902
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
this mode

903
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,040
right it just

904
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,359
we did everything correctly for the

905
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,839
first 24 hours

906
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,440
we ever created

907
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,599
almost everyone from cave and from

908
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,160
different cities as well we regrouped

909
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
we created second office on the west

910
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,359
part of ukraine

911
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,119
and we continued

912
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
our operations you know business as

913
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,680
usual plus missiles

914
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,000
thank you yes we would like to to to

915
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,640

916
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,000
operations what you can tell us what you

917
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
can tell the audience and the internet

918
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,720
in in a second uh but uh chris uh i

919
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,480
understand you were also

920
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,760
in kiev where anastasia was and just for

921
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
the context to get from kiev to the

922
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,520
western border of ukraine it's 500

923
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,599
kilometers it's not it's not super far

924
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,839
ukraine is a large country but 500

925
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,920
kilometers which you can usually

926
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,359
make in

927
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,599
in in some amount of hours right and as

928
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,480
anastasia mentioned uh her experience

929
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
was was in a traffic jam for for 12

930
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,040
hours and we here we heard why why why

931
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
that can be because the largest traffic

932
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,599
jams that i experienced in some of the

933
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,320
in

934
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
in some of the bad countries with bad

935
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,320
infrastructure are not 12 hours but in

936
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,160
war of course it's it's really hard

937
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,280
which is also why honest to say you

938
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,000
could can't join us here uh physically

939
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
today because traffic is still

940
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,440
quite unpredictable uh chris

941
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
how did your

942
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,119
mission

943
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,599
continue or changed after after it

944
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,359
became kinetic in kiev

945
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,760
uh well uh so

946
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,800
uh i we decided to

947
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,200
leave ukraine

948
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
and

949
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
we saw that the traffic jams were

950
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,480
building up we had waited for some other

951
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
people to evacuate but unfortunately

952
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
after loading them up they panicked took

953
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
all their luggage off and somehow

954
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,079
thought that they were going to hitch a

955
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,000
ride even though they were american and

956
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,680
did not speak ukrainian so i don't

957
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,440
actually know what happened to them but

958
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,599
it gave us time to uh grab eight

959
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,359
romanians who had no idea how to get

960
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
home because their employer uh wouldn't

961
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,839
answer their call when everything

962
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,480
happened uh so

963
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,640
it worked out and we decided to go a

964
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,520
southern route um and over

965
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,160
initially a bunch of farmers roads and

966
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,920
we actually got stuck in one of those

967
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,240
roads and mud but we're trying to avoid

968
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
the traffic jams and also

969
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,880
as as anastasia said take the safest

970
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
route not the shortest route we wanted

971
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,280
to

972
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
uh stay away from any sort of military

973
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
targets

974
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,480
the first time we were going to take a

975
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
break we had two vehicles a sprinter bus

976
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,240
and a car so we had 26 people with us

977
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
with kids i'm not used to kids they

978
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,839
never let you sleep um but

979
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,160
uh we were going to take a break uh

980
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,040
south of kiev and one of the uh next

981
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,680
sort of biggest cities and

982
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
uh i'd had a dutch friend

983
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,400
tracking me via gps and right when we're

984
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,720
about to pull in he goes don't go to

985
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,520
that town bombing is imminent and so we

986
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,760
immediately turned right and in less

987
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
than a minute they started shelling that

988
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,760
entire town

989
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,359
so we would have walked right into a

990
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,520
bunch of uh shelling

991
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,280
and we drove for about oh i want to say

992
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,119
22 hours

993
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,640
uh the first evening going through these

994
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,359
villages and so forth finding out that

995
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,440
the wagner group had actually planted

996
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,200
people in some of these villages trying

997
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
to set up checkpoints we found

998
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,280
propaganda leaflets and i even took a

999
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
picture of the truck that was dropping

1000
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,240
propaganda leaflets which was inviting

1001
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
the ukrainian people to welcome the

1002
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,839
russians with open arms

1003
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,880
um which i i think they underestimated

1004
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,760
uh the ukrainian people quite a bit

1005
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,240
and we ended up uh finding a hotel in

1006
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,000
the middle of nowhere not usually open

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,119
but far

1008
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,960
away from everything

1009
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,160
because we're hoping we wouldn't get

1010
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,319
bombed um

1011
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,640
and then trying to go over the border

1012
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,599
and

1013
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,359
uh we chose this seriet romanian border

1014
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,680
and when we got there the next day there

1015
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
was just a huge traffic jam i think

1016
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,839
there was something like nine kilometers

1017
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,400
of traffic just to uh get up to the

1018
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,359
border

1019
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,359
and the reasons for that i found out

1020
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,280
later uh

1021
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,480
on i think the next day uh was that the

1022
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
ukrainian border patrol had been hit by

1023
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,480
a wiper virus so it's important to

1024
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,200
remember is

1025
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
when you're trying to get over a border

1026
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,440
ukraine had an exit procedure like many

1027
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
countries do

1028
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,640
and they were also checking to make sure

1029
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,200
that you were eligible to leave if you

1030
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,920
weren't actively conscripted or not if

1031
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
you're medical personnel they wanted you

1032
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,800
to stay

1033
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,160
if you were going with your children

1034
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,599
they wanted to make sure that those

1035
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,599
children were actually yours which is

1036
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
kind of a good idea right

1037
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,520
but again if if you're fleeing not

1038
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,880
even though the ukrainian government

1039
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
like many governments say hey prepare do

1040
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
this do that

1041
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,920
well

1042
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,359
many people were hoping it wouldn't

1043
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,359
happen and some did not prepare so if

1044
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,800
suddenly your neighbor's house is on

1045
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,560
fire or part of your house has been

1046
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,119
blown apart you might not have that go

1047
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,640
bag with your children's birth

1048
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,280
certificates or your passport or things

1049
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
like that

1050
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,440
so obviously the ukrainian border patrol

1051
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,880
did not want to let anybody take

1052
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,319
children

1053
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,720
well because the wiper virus uh they

1054
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,359
were down to literally pencil and paper

1055
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,520
only letting one car through

1056
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,920
and so if you saw some of those pictures

1057
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
of uh kilometers and kilometers of

1058
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,079
traffic along some of the borders that's

1059
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,920
one of the reasons why it was slowed

1060
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,800
down

1061
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,040
and it caused a humanitarian crisis in

1062
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,200
and of itself at the border crossing

1063
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,880
that i was at

1064
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,520
one woman froze to death because she was

1065
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
there was a

1066
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,440
two petrol stations one on each side and

1067
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,760
she was waiting in a very long line to

1068
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,520
use the bathroom and it was very cold

1069
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
uh so she froze to death i mean we ended

1070
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
up sleeping in the sprinter van again

1071
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,520
the children did not let me sleep but

1072
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,839
they're wonderful children and uh

1073
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,280
because they had already restricted the

1074
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,960
sale of petrol

1075
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,400
uh when the war started um we could only

1076
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,960
keep uh the heated seats on

1077
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,680
for myself and misha we were trading off

1078
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
driving while everybody else tried to

1079
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,800
sleep in the back

1080
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,040
but we couldn't keep the heat on because

1081
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,520
we might not have enough fuel to make it

1082
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,079
if we had to stay any more days in that

1083
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,280
traffic jam

1084
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,079
so we were fighting to make sure we had

1085
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,839
just enough heat

1086
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,079
to stay awake and keep moving while

1087
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,079
everybody put together their jackets and

1088
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,920
slept in a big

1089
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,079
pile to try to keep warm

1090
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,200
because we didn't want to die of

1091
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,440
hypothermia

1092
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,400
so

1093
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,920
it was very striking um

1094
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,240
it might sound cool but in reality it's

1095
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,560
not i'm now the first person to discover

1096
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,800
a geneva convention violation through

1097
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,880
the use of cyber and that was at the

1098
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,720
ukrainian border patrol

1099
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,800
when i went public with what happened

1100
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,880
sounds cool but i've seen the human

1101
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,599
effects people had to try to walk across

1102
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,560
the border because they didn't have

1103
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,680
enough fuel

1104
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,400
there were mothers pushing babies there

1105
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,480
were people in wheelchairs or people

1106
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,440
barely walking through and it was cold

1107
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,240
it was snowy it was icy it was

1108
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,480
unpleasant and because they could only

1109
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,079
process one car at a time or one person

1110
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,880
at a time people lined up at the border

1111
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,960
luckily when he got close enough within

1112
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,040
half a kilometer they tried to give

1113
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,960
people tea but there was no place to

1114
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,160
sleep

1115
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,480
there was no place to keep warm

1116
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
and you were just standing there if you

1117
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,920
weren't in a car

1118
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
all because of malware a russian wiper

1119
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,240
virus

1120
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,319
thank you for for

1121
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,960
that sharing that experience with us

1122
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,760
peter what was the first thing that came

1123
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,240
into your mind when you heard about the

1124
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,319
missiles landing in ukraine uh what what

1125
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,440
do you think what do you feel

1126
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,839
um

1127
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,960
yeah you saw an uprise of activities

1128
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,599
going on for weeks

1129
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,640
but

1130
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
yeah i was bluntly naive to believe that

1131
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,040
putin wouldn't be that stupid to make

1132
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,520
such a move um so you keep in mind that

1133
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,160
yeah it wouldn't be that stupid although

1134
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,079
you see an uprise of troops on the

1135
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,000
border of belarus russia

1136
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
still remember the day before the 24th i

1137
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,359
had the positive covet 19

1138
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,280
result

1139
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,079
so i felt already really shitty like

1140
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,839
if something happens i'm born to the

1141
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,920
house because of restrictions

1142
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
uh and yeah indeed it happened um

1143
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,400
i saw it really quickly in the morning

1144
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
because i really slept well already for

1145
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,040
uh weeks

1146
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,720
so when the first message is coming in

1147
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,560
that they're bombing ukraine

1148
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,200
what you first do is start

1149
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,520
contacting people like an associate uh

1150
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
friends you know from the con

1151
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,839
french you know from ukraine

1152
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,839
how are their relatives doing

1153
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,640
and

1154
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,920
for me the the days after were like that

1155
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,720
uh contacting with everybody safe

1156
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
what is their position uh what

1157
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,040
information can i get from them to

1158
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
the country or even get to save a part

1159
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,160
of the country

1160
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,920
and yeah that was for me the the weeks

1161
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,880
after

1162
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,640
but at most it was disbelief how can

1163
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,000
and and

1164
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,079
in

1165
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,880
2022

1166
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,359
um such a world leader

1167
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,040
or could we not consider to be a blue

1168
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
dictator

1169
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
can make such an action and can

1170
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
affect so many lives

1171
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,880
for five million people are now

1172
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,400
displaced within europe

1173
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,040
in the netherlands 17 million that's one

1174
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,400
third of the

1175
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,280
and

1176
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,319
you can take other countries as well

1177
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,480
imagine yourself that and like honestly

1178
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
described as well that

1179
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,079
you get the message that your bombs

1180
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,599
dropping on your country and you have to

1181
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,560
grab

1182
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,319
as much as you can and you have to leave

1183
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,920
your house not knowing where you're

1184
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,800
going not knowing to a country if you

1185
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
can speak the language of

1186
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,440
um

1187
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
how the week's upcoming even months

1188
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,520
upcoming so my first concern in the

1189
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,800
weeks after war really uh about people

1190
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,440
um i got a request from uh professor

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
we did um

1194
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,160
then you get requests from people who

1195
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,960
are in the foster uh of in the in the

1198
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,119
so my weeks after the the war were

1199
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,680
really filled yeah like that

1200
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,760
people first

1201
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,960
okay

1202
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,280
um honest to see you um

1203
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,520
chris previously mentioned the attack on

1204
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
border patrol of course

1205
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,839
could you could you share the most

1206
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
prominent

1207
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,640
attacks

1208
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,800
that that you can share that the

1209
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,079
russians

1210
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,000
performed on the cyber infrastructure of

1211
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,960
ukraine and how did those attacks if at

1212
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,480
all changed over the time of five months

1213
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,480
yeah um

1214
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,880
to talk about this let's

1215
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,559
spend 30 seconds on my background

1216
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,800
i'm a security engineer and i work in

1217
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,119
data security company so we deal with

1218
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,880
cryptography

1219
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
we do have our own

1220
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,920
open source loan source solutions for

1221
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,520
data security for encryption

1222
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
and we often build

1223
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,480
um

1224
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,240
security solutions that involve

1225
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,680
different kind of encryption

1226
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,520
immunization technicians secret

1227
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,079
communication

1228
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,640
so

1229
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,720
our experience

1230
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,599
is related really a lot to companies

1231
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,599
whose data

1232
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,920
was a target of cyber attacks right

1233
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,440
um

1234
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,040
for the first the first months we seen

1235
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,559
crazy things

1236
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,960
how russians attacked

1237
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,520
non-military targets just simple

1238
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,079
commercial companies just because you

1239
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,319
know because they can't

1240
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,280
i remember a call that lasted nine hours

1241
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
together with our engineers and the

1242
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,000
engineers trying to do incident response

1243
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,920
trying to understand

1244
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,200
what was happened what data like how

1245
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,400
data was corrupted if there are backups

1246
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,960
what should we do how they should risk

1247
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,960
taps the infrastructure because we

1248
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,000
strongly advised you know

1249
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,040
to wipe the server and to set up a new

1250
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,680
one from spread

1251
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,079
we've seen attacks on and these are not

1252
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,920
miniature related companies these are

1253
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,160
not critical infrastructure companies

1254
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,280
these were companies with

1255
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,119
just funny names some names were

1256
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,559
related to some governmental

1257
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,359
services names so it feels like people

1258
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,760
who attack those companies didn't really

1259
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,640
understand

1260
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,920
[Music]

1261
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
what they are attacking and why they

1262
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,760
attacking it

1263
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,880
then we've seen companies that stopped

1264
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,680
operating in russia

1265
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,520
right and they were trying to protect

1266
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,200
the infrastructure they were trying to

1267
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,280
protect their data and their access from

1268
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,480
russia

1269
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,880
geography let's put it this way and

1270
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,280
they were protecting and they for

1271
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
example they have some servers physical

1272
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,920
servers in russia

1273
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
so their goals were to protect

1274
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,800
those servers or maybe to use it

1275
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,559
as they are already physically located

1276
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,480
in russia for some other purposes

1277
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,480
right then as i mentioned previously we

1278
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,800
do work with um some critical

1279
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,079
infrastructure with ot with operational

1280
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,160
with a with

1281
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,839
hardware

1282
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,839
telemetry kind of thing so secure

1283
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,880
telemetry and we spent really a lot of

1284
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,359
time for the first month is to in

1285
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,760
rebuilding

1286
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,000
some security layers some data

1287
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,960
protection layers of huge enterprise

1288
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,559
companies to make them more resilient

1289
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,319
for for cyber attacks and you might see

1290
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,680
that many ukrainian companies switched

1291
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,119
to a cloud

1292
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,240
so it this this first month as many

1293
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,760
companies did like emergency migrations

1294
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,480
they immigrated their infrastructure

1295
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,520
from

1296
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,960
physical servers located in ukraine

1297
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,319
to fully cloud solution and it of course

1298
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,359
brings all the security risks and all

1299
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,160
this zero trust approach we laugh a lot

1300
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,680
but

1301
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,559
under

1302
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,319
pressure

1303
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,079
missiles

1304
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,880
and the constant need to evacuate

1305
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,800
your family somewhere

1306
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,119
right

1307
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
um

1308
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,359
so regarding uh regarding the specific

1309
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,960
types of the attacks what what were the

1310
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,359
most prevalent cyber attack types that

1311
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,559
companies experienced in ukraine

1312
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,559
i can't say that this was sophisticated

1313
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,240
cyberattacks sometimes it was just a

1314
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,800
simple dose sometimes it was a simple

1315
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,240
malware

1316
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,640
wiping malware for example we've seen

1317
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,720
examples where um

1318
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
someone had access to companies

1319
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,760
infrastructure and then just wiped

1320
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,400
part of database you know it's

1321
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,720
nothing sophisticated

1322
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,640
sometimes it was yeah

1323
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,040
a lot of defaces

1324
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,000
and the face is typically masked other

1325
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,599
activities like data leakage you know

1326
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,520
so those were mostly destructive cyber

1327
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,839
attacks then um what do you think

1328
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:42,640
were

1329
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,520
main goals of the cyber part of the

1330
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,880
russian operation in ukraine

1331
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,640
uh i don't think that i am a correct

1332
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,640
person to ask this question because you

1333
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,960
want me to think how russian things and

1334
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,240
i

1335
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,559
don't want to do that

1336
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,359
that makes um even a matter of thinking

1337
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,400
and

1338
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,240
yes let's open up the question any other

1339
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,680
panelists want to take that

1340
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,599
when you're

1341
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,319
in more and things that you rely on are

1342
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,599
disrupted

1343
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,000
it also has a psychological effect on

1344
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,240
you because one thing to understand is

1345
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,839
nowadays

1346
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,200
cyber the use of digital technology

1347
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,240
has a huge psychological effect i heard

1348
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,079
one of my friends coined the phrase for

1349
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,559
misinformation disinformation mal

1350
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,240
information and propaganda as

1351
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,440
psychological malware because that it

1352
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,760
really is what it is right if you want

1353
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,359
to shake someone's

1354
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,079
spirit you try to affect them in some

1355
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,680
way you saw a lot of misinformation

1356
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,799
especially the first days

1357
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,680
around what you described as well

1358
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
the day that troops were surrendering

1359
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,280
that

1360
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
cities were already being taken

1361
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,599
and later on turned out to be all fake

1362
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,880
news so

1363
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,599
from that point of view

1364
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,640
they

1365
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,240
took a locker action into that and it

1366
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,520
was well prepared yeah

1367
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,760
for the counter-offensive this is

1368
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,160
one of the uh more interesting subtopics

1369
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,400
here and i hope

1370
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,559
some of the panels will be able to to to

1371
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,559
indicate something so

1372
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,040
from i'm i'm from latvia myself and

1373
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,119
where where i'm from we see that there

1374
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,200
are different hacker groups

1375
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,240
forming on both sides of of of of this

1376
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,040
war and doing different things uh but

1377
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,680
from your experience three of you um

1378
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,359
is anything happening

1379
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,040
how are they being organized and

1380
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,280
more importantly or or

1381
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,000
the peculiar question i have is how do

1382
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,520
ukrainians range from a legal

1383
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,720
perspective if at all this is an open

1384
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,680
question for the panel as well

1385
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,879
from legal perspective

1386
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,520
yeah i have mixed feelings about it

1387
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,880
because

1388
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,839
i am not aware

1389
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,359
and chris next to me knows more about

1390
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,480
that as well

1391
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,319
um that if we as vigilant civilians take

1392
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,160
actions into our own hands

1393
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,480
are disrupting operations that are

1394
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,880
already going on and organized by

1395
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,359
uh intelligence servers or by military

1396
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,799
so um

1397
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,480
i'm kind of like

1398
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,720
double into this on one hand i think he

1399
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,520
has disrupts everything regarding russia

1400
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
that is possible but on the other hand i

1401
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,559
also were aware of the fact that

1402
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,359
we have intelligence servers that might

1403
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,200
be in or might take actions already and

1404
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,319
then we are disrupting their work so

1405
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,480
yeah that's the double moral i have in

1406
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,359
this one well i'll tell you some good

1407
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,599
news when it comes to this part of we'll

1408
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,400
say hacktivism

1409
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,000
when it comes to trying to protect

1410
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,119
ukraine i was just in geneva

1411
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,720
at the u.n

1412
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,240
the week before last after remember

1413
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,160
where i travel sometimes i travel too

1414
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,920
much and as was pointed out from a

1415
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,960
high-ranking official from the u.n uh

1416
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,200
towards the russian minister of foreign

1417
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
affairs deputy director of information

1418
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,280
security who decided to show up and

1419
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,480
disrupt the conference

1420
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,040
and had shouted at some people because

1421
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,880
this is how it works it's because of

1422
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,119
russia that there is no actual

1423
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,119
international definition of what cyber

1424
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,599
warfare is and also russia fought the

1425
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,640
u.n

1426
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,040
on what many countries and people

1427
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,200
believe are what are referred to as

1428
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,400
international norms in cyberspace

1429
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,280
so

1430
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,240
it leaves this gray area open for people

1431
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,280
to actually try to help ukraine

1432
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,599
and try to disrupt russia all because

1433
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,240
russia wanted to be a bunch of

1434
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,160
i mean i mean bad people um so uh thanks

1435
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,640
russia in some ways

1436
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,440
the

1437
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,160
person from russia was not too thrilled

1438
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,119
by the u.n person from estonia and

1439
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,440
yelled at her and called her some names

1440
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,480
in russia

1441
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,680
and then left and caused an

1442
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
international incident but it's of their

1443
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,319
own making i too am um

1444
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,799
kind of torn because i also think about

1445
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,119
the safety aspect you know it's one

1446
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,440
thing to do face a website or a

1447
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,880
distributed denial of service

1448
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,760
it's another thing if it were to

1449
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,040
cause uh a loss of human life and we are

1450
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,440
definitely we have been at that point in

1451
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
cyber operations where you can actually

1452
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,720
do that so i too have mixed feelings i

1453
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,799
love the fact that uh the kremlin's

1454
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,119
website was completely defaced

1455
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,200
um but also

1456
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,760
uh hope that it doesn't affect uh

1457
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,079
civilians in russia because there are

1458
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,640
some people in russia uh who do not

1459
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,280
agree with this war and russia can use

1460
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,160
anything that could affect safety

1461
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,559
um in this respect as completely

1462
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,160
twisting it around

1463
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,240
and uh

1464
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,559
unfortunately affecting the hearts and

1465
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,319
minds of some of those people who

1466
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,520
support ukraine and russia

1467
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,240
is there anything to address this year

1468
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,040
yeah you know that starting from

1469
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,200
february 25th

1470
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,359
probably one of the first days of full

1471
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,799
scan invasion in ukraine we have a law

1472
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,440
that legally allows ukrainians to kill

1473
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,880
occupiers

1474
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,640
without any legal consequences

1475
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,119
there we go so

1476
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,559
do you accept ukrainian citizens they

1477
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,160
accept new citizens you can come become

1478
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,160
a citizen that's right for you i think

1479
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,240
that's that's one way to do it

1480
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,720
honestly saying citizen thing is very

1481
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,599
complicated in ukraine so many people

1482
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,520
who actually want to receive ukrainian

1483
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,119
citizens they

1484
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,599
it's very complicated to do

1485
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,799
for now maybe it will be easier so yeah

1486
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,000
so we are seeing a lot of information

1487
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,240
leaks especially in the the

1488
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,440
five months four months ago we've

1489
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,799
seen that

1490
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,799
information of russian officers is being

1491
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,960
leaked almost every month we also seen

1492
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,480
some leaks

1493
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,359
from the ukrainian side

1494
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,359
why and how do you think is that

1495
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,520
happening is that are those activists

1496
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,240
are those government officials

1497
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,720
government official hackers is there a

1498
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,200
difference in this war between those two

1499
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,520
groups

1500
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,839
open

1501
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,599
questions yeah let me

1502
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,079
jump in here i think that many people

1503
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,319
especially russians believe that ukraine

1504
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,920
has some centralized cyber security

1505
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,440
hierarchy

1506
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,920
and uh you remember one of the first

1507
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,280
days they

1508
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,000
hit the tv center in cave with missile

1509
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,440
so hitting

1510
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,000
assuming that we have if we hit tv

1511
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,200
center the tv will be down but alto e is

1512
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,440
digital satellite kind of thing you know

1513
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,680
so they just killed innocent people they

1514
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,520
didn't actually disrupt it operations

1515
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,079
maybe like for

1516
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,359
some hours so the thing that there is no

1517
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,839
one single

1518
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,240
centralized knowing all

1519
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,040
cyber security structure in ukraine

1520
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,960
there are tons

1521
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,440
dozens of groups

1522
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,079
that do something some of these groups

1523
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:26,839
are

1524
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,520
governmental and like created by

1525
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,400
government officials like i.t army for

1526
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,520
example

1527
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,280
the huge telegram channel 200 000 people

1528
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,079
right other groups are created by a

1529
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,119
military organization because military

1530
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,400
also has a structure so intelligence

1531
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,720
external internal intelligence some

1532
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,640
different kind of military organizations

1533
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,599
they have their own cyber units they can

1534
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,520
create their own groups for their own

1535
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,040
operations

1536
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,280
right and there are people who just work

1537
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,760
in the field there is security community

1538
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,599
there are many many people who want to

1539
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,359
feel involved

1540
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,960
who group together and do something

1541
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,920
so it's a huge distributed mesh kind of

1542
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,000
system which has both pros and cons

1543
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,640
it's very complicated to stop

1544
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,559
such structure because there is no

1545
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,119
single point of failure at the same time

1546
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,760
it's very complicated to control

1547
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,280
such structure

1548
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,920
so yeah and since

1549
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,680
end of february i believe that many

1550
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,599
foreigners who wanted to

1551
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,240
impact the situation they offered their

1552
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,280
help

1553
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,960
and some of them

1554
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,880
continue working on different operations

1555
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,400
right so we cannot say that this

1556
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,720
structure is purely ukrainian

1557
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,960
no it's not it's it's a mix of things

1558
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,760
and as in hacker movies

1559
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,400
uh often people don't know the names of

1560
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,200
other people they're working with

1561
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,520
they might know they might not know the

1562
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,559
end target they do some things

1563
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,200
and they feel that they have impact on

1564
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,960
the situation that they help in the

1565
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,559
country

1566
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,880
and they don't need any money they don't

1567
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,559
need any

1568
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,240
you know uh

1569
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,400
put they don't need putting their names

1570
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,880
onto this they just put their time and

1571
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,920
efforts and skills

1572
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,319
so i understand according to to my

1573
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,079
knowledge

1574
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,319
both in the occupied parts of ukraine

1575
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,559
and if and free parts of ukraine the

1576
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,280
internet is up and running

1577
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,920
not flawlessly but but well enough

1578
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,079
um open question once again to the whole

1579
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,559
panel why do you think that is

1580
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,480
how how does that work

1581
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,440
and

1582
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,799
why is it allowed to work

1583
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,480
why is the internet up why the internet

1584
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,240
yeah i i have my my own views on it uh

1585
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,079
one of the reasons why i think that the

1586
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,720
internet was kind of allowed to stay up

1587
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,240
to a certain extent

1588
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,440
is because uh russia kind of enjoyed the

1589
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,559
fact that uh people were documenting

1590
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,880
this war on social media this is the

1591
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,599
first war that's really been documented

1592
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,400
all over the place on social media so if

1593
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,480
you are sitting in moldova

1594
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,559
and you are fearing that something's

1595
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,920
going to happen

1596
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,520
and you are seeing what's happening just

1597
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,000
over the border and you're like you know

1598
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,160
maybe we should uh

1599
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,480
you know kind of fold uh when it comes

1600
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,880
to russia because we don't want uh

1601
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,039
what's happening in the ukraine and all

1602
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,440
the atrocities that happen here i think

1603
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,880
it was very much

1604
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,480
at least in my opinion part of the

1605
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,200
reason was the psychological effect on

1606
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,000
neighboring countries which also russia

1607
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,280
has

1608
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,520
either both threatened directly

1609
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,839
or has also launched various cyber

1610
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,319
attacks against

1611
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,599
any more comments on that part

1612
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,240
it's very easy to destroy infrastructure

1613
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,359
with

1614
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,599
missiles

1615
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,760
right couple of missiles in certain

1616
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,839
places and you can physically destroy

1617
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,160
part of infrastructure but it might be

1618
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,559
not so easy to destroy

1619
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,640
these kind of state

1620
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,359
infrastructures with cyber attacks

1621
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,960
yeah what i also think is um

1622
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,359
it it it's already since 2014 that this

1623
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,640
is going on

1624
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,400
and um

1625
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,960
if you look to ukraine situation um

1626
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,640
i can imagine myself that they were

1627
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,000
prepared for such an event coming so

1628
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,079
their infrastructure was already

1629
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,720
on a certain level prepared to such an

1630
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,720
innovation i think

1631
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,160
um

1632
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,359
so yeah that's

1633
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,960
what i consider to be the reason why

1634
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,880
it's still up and running there

1635
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,640
so uh four days ago

1636
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,520
the

1637
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,680
occupiers have uh started blocking

1638
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,720
google services in uhanx and

1639
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,079
donetsk

1640
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,039
uh any sort of that in relation to the

1641
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,799
the internet being available in general

1642
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:09,839
what's their goal there

1643
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,720
control the narrative

1644
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,599
russia also uh instituted fine against

1645
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,440
google in russia

1646
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,920
because it was serving up google news

1647
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,559
that the kremlin did not agree with

1648
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,480
so if you can control the flow of

1649
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,760
information

1650
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,839
and only uh push your agenda because

1651
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:31,200
there's no more free media uh inside

1652
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,720
russia there's none

1653
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,160
the last uh channel ended just after the

1654
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,520
start of the war

1655
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,079
so control the narrative there is this

1656
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,720
great paper that was written by

1657
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,640
a guy at dutch university i'm terrible

1658
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,319
with names can't remember it for the

1659
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,400
life of me but it is called the

1660
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,039
dictator's guide to the internet

1661
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,920
it's about 20 some 30 some pages

1662
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,119
uh double spaced and it is a playbook

1663
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,440
about 10 11 years old

1664
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,000
about how dictators can control the

1665
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,520
internet i highly recommend it it has a

1666
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,359
weird url but it really is uh that

1667
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,400
but the

1668
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,319
dictator's guide to the internet it's

1669
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,119
almost like a playbook of uh shutting

1670
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,119
down certain services controlling the

1671
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,920
media allowing your version of social

1672
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,160
media to stay up while blocking out

1673
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,039
other forms such as twitter or linkedin

1674
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,599
uh fun fact several years ago rush

1675
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,960
actually made linkedin illegal so to uh

1676
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,559
communicate with some of my friends who

1677
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,119
worked at kaspersky i had to set up a

1678
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,960
special email account just for

1679
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,119
communications because signal also

1680
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,839
didn't work and a few other things so it

1681
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,640
really follows that guide

1682
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,119
so those can be so some of the reasons

1683
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,799
to control that narrative

1684
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,359
yeah and it's easier to do when you have

1685
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:00,160
occupied the territory my point is that

1686
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,359
cyber attacks have limited scope

1687
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,920
on such huge infrastructure as internet

1688
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,160
as mobile network as critical

1689
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,680
infrastructure but when you have

1690
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,640
missiles or you you are physically on

1691
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,559
this territory you can do more things

1692
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,480
that's why i really like the initiative

1693
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,000
of squad 303 i presumably

1694
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,599
my co-fellas here on the table know them

1695
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,559
as well

1696
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,839
it wasn't it is a service where you can

1697
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:28,799
send

1698
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,839
people in russia information like you

1699
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,319
know what is going on and

1700
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,400
i did it as well and i had some really

1701
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,880
interesting conversations

1702
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,160
most of them swearing at me like yeah

1703
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,559
you're just a nazi culprit or whatever

1704
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,240
but i also had a couple of conversations

1705
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,880
where people actually said that yes

1706
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,119
we are aware of the situation and we are

1707
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,119
organizing ourselves and of course the

1708
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,000
true worthiness is hard to determine but

1709
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,119
yet still

1710
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,799
this little yeah

1711
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,880
i hope you have within russian society

1712
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,599
that

1713
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,920
uh some bright mind maybe uh take up

1714
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,599
some action against the current

1715
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,760
dictatorship going on there but that is

1716
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,240
a really nice action to

1717
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,319
start a conversation from human to human

1718
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,400
yeah and there's no lot of tech involved

1719
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,920
in that everyone can do it you can even

1720
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,560
ask your mom to do that and it generates

1721
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
automatically a message use google

1722
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,839
translate and try to get the yeah get

1723
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:24,719
them in

1724
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,319
in a conversation with them

1725
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,399
so that's

1726
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,960
now before we move to the final part of

1727
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,600
the panel when where we talk about what

1728
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,000
should happen next and how can we help

1729
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,198
further

1730
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,880
a question for this part of the panel

1731
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,279
on the cyber front do you think russians

1732
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,399
have achieved their goals so far

1733
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,519
no and they never will be

1734
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,520
yeah everyone agrees okay the

1735
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,040
easy and sweet answer and now you

1736
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,198
already see that that the the first

1737
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,080
stage of uh the reason why they started

1738
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,520
this war was a quick move towards kiev

1739
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,960
and um

1740
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,198
on everything they filled

1741
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,080
uh and and that has many military

1742
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,120
several reasons for that uh logistics uh

1743
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,319
corruption

1744
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,679
uh uh uh material um

1745
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,920
yeah the the the strongest of the

1746
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,198
ukrainian army because after 2014 after

1747
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,600
yanukovych completely ripped that army

1748
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,359
um the army was completely rebuilt and

1749
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,198
also according to

1750
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,359
modern standards i'm not going to

1751
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,399
address it

1752
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,640
but um

1753
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,759
yeah

1754
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,759
he made a fatal mistake that he could

1755
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,799
overrun and and you see that as well

1756
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,880
he was also misled

1757
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,719
you see ron putin a couple of

1758
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,719
intelligence officers were

1759
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,040
detained ended up uh

1760
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,120
being falling out of balconies and stuff

1761
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,719
like that

1762
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,960
that happens in russia sorry that

1763
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,800
happens in russia

1764
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,640
the russian tradition but

1765
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,560
on that you can indicate as well that

1766
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,560
putin was completely misled into this

1767
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,199
war but now he stepped in and now what

1768
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,159
you see i know in the past few months

1769
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,560
that destruction is his only goal

1770
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,199
destruct as much of ukraine as you can

1771
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,440
because his real fear is not

1772
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,760
uh ukraine as a country not ukraine as a

1773
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,760
member of the european union not ukraine

1774
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,000
as a nato member no the success of

1775
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,760
ukraine is putin's biggest fear because

1776
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,840
then russians see what happens to

1777
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,840
ukraine can also happen to us

1778
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,199
no i agree i mean definitely he

1779
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,719
underestimated

1780
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,120
ukrainian farmers picking up

1781
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,320
tanks and towing them away

1782
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,480
but also he was surrounded by a lot of

1783
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,400
yes men i mean if you're around putin

1784
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,760
you'd kind of be afraid of being around

1785
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,239
putin anyway uh and i think more people

1786
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,159
have died falling out of balconies who

1787
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,800
uh are government officials and of covet

1788
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,520
at this point um so i don't think it has

1789
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,400
achieved the goals that they intended uh

1790
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,440
they had intended for example to

1791
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,800
strike fear

1792
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,400
and to uh some countries as well

1793
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,760
and that hasn't quite worked out um in

1794
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,440
georgia uh there's uh one of these areas

1795
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,880
that's they kind of refer to as

1796
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,880
breakaway south otessa and uh just

1797
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,440
before new leader was voted in

1798
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,120
the now previous leaders said we're

1799
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,040
going to have a referendum and join

1800
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,199
russia and right before the referendum a

1801
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,640
new leader was voted in and they're like

1802
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,800
no we don't want to be part of russia

1803
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,640
we're we're fine the way we are

1804
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,040
um because you know what russia's not

1805
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,320
going to have our back russia's not

1806
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,560
going to be able to pay for stuff um

1807
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,960
they're they're hosed so

1808
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,280
this idea that certain you know russian

1809
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,880
enclaves or former soviet countries

1810
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,360
would kind of bow down to russia uh

1811
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,520
isn't happening and so i think that's

1812
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,320
also proof positive between that and the

1813
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,120
spirit of the ukrainians that is ongoing

1814
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,960
uh proves that russia has not reached

1815
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,600
its goals thank goodness they haven't

1816
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,520
chris you touched international aspects

1817
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,360
here so uh peter you would be a good

1818
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,360
person to um

1819
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,280
state your opinion on what do you think

1820
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,679
ukraine needs internationally moving

1821
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,080
forward

1822
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,360
um

1823
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,239
i was in levitt in the

1824
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,719
beginning of june um

1825
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,480
i met up of course nancy we're drunk

1826
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,600
um

1827
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,040
and

1828
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,960
i've spoken to the guy we handed over

1829
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,600
the medical gear mikhailov and asked me

1830
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,800
kyle as well what does ukraine beside

1831
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,400
weapons need

1832
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,320
after the war

1833
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,280
and

1834
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,440
plain answer was knowledge

1835
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,600
notice how you construct your society's

1836
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,920
knowledge how you construct your

1837
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,400
governmental organization uh

1838
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,800
knowledge on on how the rule of law in

1839
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,679
your country works

1840
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,600
and in order to make

1841
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,760
and i think we should

1842
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,960
yeah

1843
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,600
rebuild ukraine after this even stronger

1844
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
even better than before

1845
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,280
to make sure that such a brutal action

1846
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,199
never will be accepted by the free and

1847
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:14,000
liberal society in the western world

1848
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,440
we won't

1849
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,280
let this happen we promise ourselves

1850
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,920
after 45 this will never happen again

1851
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,480
and we should stick to that promise no

1852
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,920
matter what

1853
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,679
and um

1854
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,679
yeah from that perspective i think and

1855
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,600
especially for people here in the room

1856
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,120
um

1857
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,400
i think we should

1858
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
support ukraine

1859
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,920
with whatever we can

1860
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,320
whatever you can do to make this turn

1861
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,080
into a better outcome for ukraine do it

1862
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,120
so what

1863
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,320
what should

1864
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,280
ukraine do after they win the war

1865
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,360
make sure they never come again

1866
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,920
um yeah build a real

1867
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,840
freaking wall uh

1868
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,040
on the russian ukrainian border as high

1869
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,040
as it can uh

1870
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,159
because

1871
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,040
yeah

1872
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,239
they will come again and um and

1873
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,159
yeah become brazilian become stronger

1874
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,280
than ever before and with the help of of

1875
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,800
yeah all the the the civilized countries

1876
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,360
i think we can yeah

1877
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,440
get them reset the goal

1878
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,600
any more thoughts on that in the panel

1879
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
well i think a couple of other things

1880
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,360
are going to be required such as tech

1881
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,440
diplomacy i think this is a real good

1882
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,000
opportunity uh from the digital world to

1883
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,920
rebuild things uh to give you some

1884
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,320
background a lot of farming equipment uh

1885
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,360
is still made in belarus and that was

1886
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,480
one of the places that a lot of

1887
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,159
ukrainian farmers would buy their gear

1888
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,719
because it was less expensive than say

1889
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,040
a caterpillar tractor or something like

1890
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,120
that in the u.s

1891
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,480
so

1892
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,400
looking at

1893
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,960
cyber security portion definitely

1894
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,520
looking at the laws like you mentioned

1895
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,840
especially in regards to privacy

1896
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,600
because a lot of the

1897
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
data leaks have been done to try to get

1898
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,280
you know surveillance information on

1899
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,800
people

1900
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
looking at agricultural technology

1901
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,480
because a lot of the fields have been

1902
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,280
really badly burned and destroyed so

1903
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,199
they're going to have to be redone so

1904
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,120
more efficient agriculture is going to

1905
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,920
be needed uh ukraine has for a very long

1906
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,000
time been the bread basket of europe and

1907
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,120
now it's also the bread basket of africa

1908
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,880
and parts of asia now that's been

1909
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,080
disrupted so they'll need um

1910
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,560
much more modern farming techniques and

1911
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,199
a way to cut off uh farming supplies and

1912
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,040
agricultural supplies from belarus

1913
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,239
completely for the next season uh and it

1914
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,719
also gives this opportunity to

1915
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,080
uh even add more digitization where

1916
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,600
required

1917
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,000
because the russians will not stop i

1918
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,640
mean if you look back in history i

1919
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,360
remember when my grandmother uh and her

1920
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,360
family had to leave they had to live

1921
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,480
through a famine in the 1930s in ukraine

1922
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,280
and then when world war ii happened uh

1923
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,800
so they uh went to the u.s

1924
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
but since then uh

1925
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,800
we have a real opportunity

1926
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,600
to

1927
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,040
make ukraine

1928
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,320
a powerhouse and ukraine has for quite a

1929
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,480
few years already been used as a lower

1930
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,120
cost center for a lot of developers

1931
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,040
programmers and a lot of digital

1932
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,159
technology already so

1933
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,600
there's a good amount of knowledge in

1934
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,239
that realm there as well

1935
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,640
so i'm looking forward to

1936
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,480
helping uh with

1937
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,360
all of my friends anastasia

1938
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,480
peter

1939
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,000
uh everyone else making sure that

1940
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,080
ukraine is

1941
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,679
even better

1942
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,400
than we are right now in the netherlands

1943
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,360
uh because russia is never going to just

1944
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,320
stop at ukraine

1945
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,560
yeah i agree

1946
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,840
and i think that every extreme situation

1947
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,800
it

1948
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,840
requires some extreme efforts

1949
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,440
right and

1950
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,679
many people in ukraine in different

1951
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:08,880
industries

1952
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,960
including cyber security

1953
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,360
right now they gain

1954
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,840
very unique experience

1955
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,520
unfortunately

1956
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,320
but they gain a very unique experience

1957
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,239
that after the war

1958
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,840
can be used

1959
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,960
you know

1960
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,440
for better goals

1961
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,600
for for improvements for collaboration

1962
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,960
with different companies for

1963
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,960
collaboration with different countries

1964
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,120
to create something more valuable

1965
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,239
because

1966
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,120
what we see right now is a mix at least

1967
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,480
from my standpoint is it it's a mix

1968
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,520
of

1969
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,560
digital and real world and how it will

1970
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,280
all it all work together yeah right now

1971
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,360
it all works together in a military

1972
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,880
context for our victory but

1973
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,159
in few months and few years these can

1974
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,440
lead to

1975
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,360
you know normal

1976
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,239
normal usages peaceful time usages

1977
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,120
because unfortunately every war

1978
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,840
is has impulse

1979
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,440
to create something new some new

1980
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,400
technology to build something afterward

1981
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,719
right

1982
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,320
so my final question for

1983
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,960
all the panelists is

1984
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,960
what did you learn

1985
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,040
during these five months that can be

1986
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,120
applicable in peace time are there any

1987
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,120
best practices that you can share with

1988
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,280
us

1989
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,840
uh freedom is not for free

1990
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,679
i think the biggest mistake and the

1991
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,159
the nato slash western european

1992
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,760
countries made

1993
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,280
was that

1994
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,520
after the fall of the wall we thought

1995
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,840
that we could cut budgets on all and

1996
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
especially if it looked to not for the

1997
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,600
united states but especially the western

1998
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,280
european countries they

1999
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,760
cut it on budget for defense

2000
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,400
and we now see the impact we don't have

2001
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,080
a

2002
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,120
military answer to such a geopolitical

2003
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,600
situation

2004
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,000
that should be for what i consider to be

2005
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,040
the

2006
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,480
the western european countries the

2007
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,520
lessons learned invest in your defense

2008
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,080
systems invest in

2009
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,199
knowledgeable soldiers to react in such

2010
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,480
situations

2011
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,840
um

2012
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,920
and and that's why i say

2013
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,560
freedom is not for free

2014
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,120
yes you never hope you will have to use

2015
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,400
your military interaction but

2016
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,719
in such a situation you rather want to

2017
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,360
have them well trained well equipped to

2018
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,000
act on such brutal actions as

2019
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,280
this dictator is now showing over europe

2020
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,840
and

2021
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,400
um yeah what i learned as well

2022
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,040
is that um

2023
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,320
under pressure everything's become fluid

2024
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,600
we saw a lot of legislation because um

2025
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,280
for example ukrainians were allowed to

2026
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,360
travel into the european union to

2027
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,600
be a tourist

2028
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,400
and

2029
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,080
because of the situation and the urgent

2030
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,400
situation at paul's border

2031
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,199
we could arrange so quick so

2032
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,760
magnificent

2033
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,480
care for people that i think that if we

2034
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,400
really want

2035
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,440
stuff to happen it will happen

2036
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,600
as long as you you believe in the core

2037
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,360
values that you have and

2038
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,679
that's something i also learned that if

2039
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:36,080
you really want you can do it thank you

2040
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,679
chris

2041
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:38,800
well um

2042
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,719
i think some of the things that

2043
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,440
can be made better like peter i was also

2044
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,760
trying to help a lot of people evacuate

2045
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,120
especially some of the international

2046
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,400
students or elderly or handicapped or

2047
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,840
folks who are the most vulnerable who

2048
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,760
are unfortunately the most difficult to

2049
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,719
get out

2050
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,360
and i ran into a lot of governments and

2051
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,679
their embassies who gave such bad tech

2052
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:00,480
advice

2053
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,199
that they either got people killed or

2054
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,960
were about to get their own citizens

2055
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,400
killed

2056
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,600
and this is a problem around the world

2057
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,400
but shockingly uh quite frequent in the

2058
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,159
western world where they don't

2059
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,880
understand uh how to actually write

2060
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,679
policy and talk to technologists like us

2061
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,679
and if they do write policy it's not

2062
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,480
implementable uh so understanding things

2063
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,239
i remember when i was trying to get over

2064
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,600
the border with our convoy i was

2065
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,199
speaking with someone from the u.s state

2066
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,120
department and it turns out she didn't

2067
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,199
know how to use whatsapp when i was

2068
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,679
trying to send a list of passports an

2069
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,080
identification for another convoy filled

2070
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,239
with elderly people many of which had

2071
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,400
either dementia or

2072
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,320
diabetes and needed to make sure they

2073
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,639
had some sort of medication and carers

2074
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,040
can you imagine during a war

2075
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,639
somebody who works for us state

2076
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,320
department doesn't understand how to use

2077
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,520
whatsapp

2078
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,520
uh mind was blown i actually had to hang

2079
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,239
up with her because i was so angry

2080
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,239
so a lot of governments also have to

2081
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,880
understand that uh that psychological

2082
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,520
malware that i spoke about before

2083
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,600
why it's so important to build

2084
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,679
countermeasures and groups and actually

2085
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,080
take it seriously because we've seen

2086
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,520
even in the uk

2087
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,800
where brexit kind of was skewed a little

2088
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,880
bit and they're already finding links

2089
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,960
between russian money and so forth so

2090
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,800
these types of things need to be taken

2091
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,560
seriously and i think this is one thing

2092
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,320
that the uh war has taught us is if we

2093
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,719
are still standing in an analog shadow

2094
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,639
during a war that is also fought on the

2095
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,719
digital front we are going to fail

2096
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:35,920
miserably

2097
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,199
so i think that's one thing that should

2098
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,639
be learned

2099
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,960
right honestly

2100
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,840
well as um

2101
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,639
as a citizen i would say that

2102
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,080
i learned that citizenship is not on the

2103
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,040
rise but responsibilities

2104
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,600
right that's why i'm here in ukraine

2105
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,880
because as a citizen i have

2106
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,560
responsibility and i have unique skills

2107
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,679
and an opportunity

2108
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,480
as a person i learned that

2109
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,880
if i survive all of this i will be

2110
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,280
unstoppable

2111
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,120
i mean literally if i can do this crazy

2112
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,600
things i'm doing right now

2113
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,760
under constant stream of bad news

2114
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,239
physical missiles and calling my

2115
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,239
relatives to learn if they're still

2116
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,718
alive

2117
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,679
i can do anything

2118
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,679
as many ukrainians

2119
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,360
right now yeah we will probably need

2120
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,800
some break

2121
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,880
to you know to sleep

2122
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
to regain

2123
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,000
to like

2124
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,560
to feel less tired after the war

2125
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,960
after our victory but then

2126
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,719
they're gonna be unstoppable in anything

2127
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,000
thank you this is um inspirational

2128
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,880
