2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
hi everybody my name is sikha francos

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,960
i've been a developer for more than

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,520
seven years at the open stage foundation

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,519
and i'll be talking about democracy

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,840
eventually digitally transparent

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,519
question mark

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,320
so

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
just a short introduction this is the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
open state foundation team

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,800
um

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,239
there's a new person right there as you

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,440
can see um we're based in amsterdam um

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,960
and there are about a team of eight

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
people two three developers and some

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
people that work on lobbying

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
project management research and things

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
like that

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
um

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
open state foundation exists since 2012

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,199
where a merger of two other

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
organizations

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,480
had never stemmed the new voting which

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
tried to bridge the gap between politics

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
and public using digital tools

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
and hector government hector override

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
which was an organization that organized

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
many hackathons and events

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,400
to open up the government

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,880
so

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
where do what what do we focus on

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
there's many things in government and we

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
try to cover as much as possible

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
um we've

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
broken it up in some into some themes so

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,159
elections are really important to be as

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
transparent as possible you need to know

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
how and where you can vote you need to

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
know that the results are correct and

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,680
you know at this moment in the

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,240
netherlands we get the early results via

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
a media

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
company which is weird because the

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
government should just provide the

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,439
results so there's a lot of transparency

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,560
needed there

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
then you have the politicians that are

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
elected that will make a lot of

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,799
decisions

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,840
um

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,200
how do they

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
come to these decisions what decisions

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
are made

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,280
they should be all as public as possible

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,600
and with these decisions come a lot of

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
financing and money that that's being

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,799
spent

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
uh where is it being spent on does it is

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,280
it used correctly

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
and in the end you have like the results

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
so what society do we end up with

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,239
can we measure this can we

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
maybe reuse data that government

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,910
collects to perform its duties

65
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,640
[Music]

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
basically transparency has many many

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,879
advantages so um

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
with government you you can hold

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,239
government accountable which is really

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,360
important

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
uh you can have commercial uh reuse of

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
the data there's often more value in the

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
data set than you can imagine at the

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
start

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
and it makes makes things much more

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
efficient for example data sets that we

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
often publish

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
the biggest reuses are government

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,519
organizations themselves because

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,440
suddenly they can easily access the data

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
via an api or a nice search interface

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,599
so it would be just much easier if they

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
publish this data themselves in an open

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
and transparent way

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
so basically we do this

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
in two ways we try to accelerate the

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
opening up of all the data

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
and then we promote the reuse of these

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,760
data sets via hackathons and meetups and

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,159
events

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
enough about

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
open states

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
let's just get into the talk

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
don't read everything here just pick

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
pick some sentences this is an

96
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
old list that's been going around it's

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
called the 50 shades of no

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
um because it's really easy to not be

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,040
transparent and to not open up

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
and many of these reasons make sense i

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
mean that they

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
they can be like uh gut feelings to to

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
not open up because it's scary and

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,760
you're vulnerable but um many of them i

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
mean too expensive is at the top of the

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,920
list yeah it's gonna probably cost some

107
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
money so so it

108
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
you have to fix that

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
the thing is if there's like one reason

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
to to say no to open up

111
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
you can solve it but most of the times

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
there's a collection of no's

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
coming together and you know you see

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
that that a government stagnates and

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,519
doesn't

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
open up and and publish the data that

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
they

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
should publish

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
um so i'll be going through some

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
projects that we've done in the past

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
couple of years

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,079
and show you how we've

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
gotten a lot of no's and how we've

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
overcome them

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
um so let's start with open spending

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,360
this is a website openspending.com

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
where we publish all the budgets and

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,199
spending of local uh governments in the

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
netherlands so municipalities water

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,160
councils

131
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
which is fun to know that it's like the

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
oldest democratic institute in the

133
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,799
netherlands is managing water

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
processes provinces and

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
collaborations between municipalities

136
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
back in 2012 2013 we

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
we heard that

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,479
all these local governments um publish

139
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,800
their their spending and budgets in a

140
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
standardized format and

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
send it to the national government so

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
they could check if everything is okay

143
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
so we started asking uh like the the

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
statistics office in the netherlands cbs

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,039
central below for statistique

146
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
they collected all these

147
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
budgets and spending of all local

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,919
governments

149
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
could you just publish this could you

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
just you know put it on a website in an

151
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
api or whatever they were already

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
publishing a lot of data and they said

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,479
no

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,080
it's not our job

155
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,199
um

156
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,560
and they said

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
it's not ours we don't have

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
authorization from the data owner which

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
is true the

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,880
municipalities and local governments

161
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
were still the owner of these these

162
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,479
files

163
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
so they wouldn't publish it and what we

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
started doing was

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
just asking as an ngo as people part of

166
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
society can we have this file but

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
there's hundreds of these

168
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,560
of these local governments so you have

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,840
like 300 back in the days 370

170
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
municipalities and there's 12 provinces

171
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,039
and

172
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,520
hundreds of collaborations and

173
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
water councils so we've

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
emailed them and called them for years

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
and started to gather all these files

176
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
and put them on open spending.nl

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
so after a few years we had a good

178
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
collection like a third of all these

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,639
local municipal of local governments

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
were covered on our website and we had

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
them on a map so you could see these are

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
transparent and these are not

183
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,880
and this started a whole discussion uh

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,240
within this this um space of of local

185
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
governments because some would say why

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
isn't my local municipality on on this

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
website and how do we get there and then

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
someone would somebody else would say no

189
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,039
we don't give away this file but why

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,880
don't we give away this file

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,919
um

192
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
because all the other municipalities are

193
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
already on there

194
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
so this website created a lot of

195
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,639
pressure

196
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,960
on the local governments to finally say

197
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
okay maybe

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
this makes sense it's just budgets and

199
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
spending which should be open anyway

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
let's just

201
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
ask the statistics office to publish it

202
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,800
all and the statistics office finally

203
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
said okay now it is our job

204
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
so

205
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
we now since quite a few years have have

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
all the local governments covered for

207
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
like

208
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
there's 12 years of data and well it's a

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
big data set um

210
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
and we're really happy with this um i

211
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
think it's still

212
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
in the world

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
quite special to have a standardized

214
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,840
budget and spending of local governments

215
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
on

216
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
just yeah available

217
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,220
then again it could be better um

218
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,479
[Music]

219
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,120
we it's only high level data it's only

220
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
like how much has been spent on sports

221
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,759
or culture and maybe a bit more specific

222
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
than that but

223
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,919
in the end spending goes way down until

224
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
the receipt level the bonuses

225
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,039
um why not publish this i mean

226
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,080
just

227
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,599
to give a

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
short disclaimer open state foundation

229
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,319
is

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,840
likes transparency but we also like

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,800
privacy so we don't want you know

232
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,479
personal information to be published we

233
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,720
don't want state secrets to be published

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
but many information is just

235
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
easy to publish and there's there's no

236
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
reason not to do it

237
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
um so we're currently working with with

238
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,319
government to create a new standard to

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
publish even you know up to way more

240
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
levels deep uh

241
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
of budget and spending data

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
let's move to the next project that

243
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
we've done is called

244
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160
virus my stem locale or where is my

245
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,039
polling station

246
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
this is again a project where you think

247
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
doesn't government already do this

248
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,599
they they obviously

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
organize the elections so they know

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
where the polling stations are they

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
probably publish it online right and

252
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
they do but in the netherlands

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,240
municipalities organize all elections so

254
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
uh even the national elections or

255
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
european elections

256
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
and there's at this moment like 345

257
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
municipalities

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
and they

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
can be big municipalities small

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,640
municipalities and they have many ways

261
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
in which they publish their

262
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
voting stations

263
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
the best ones have like an interactive

264
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
map like we do

265
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
but many just publish a pdf with

266
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
addresses which isn't really

267
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
helpful if you quickly want to see what

268
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
what voting station you want to use

269
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
and it's not reusable the data so

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,959
we again asked

271
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,000
you know the

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
ministry and the municipalities can't

273
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
you just publish this

274
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
in a nice standardized way

275
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,760
as a big data set because we don't want

276
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,600
345 small data sets that differ we want

277
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,040
all the information

278
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
and we got the question

279
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
but who's going to use this

280
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
which is a fair question again so

281
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
the first year we did this was 2017 and

282
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
we manually

283
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
collected all the information of all the

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
municipalities which was well a lot of

285
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
work

286
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,880
and it was used by

287
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
nearly a million people so apparently

288
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
people do want this information and it's

289
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
useful and you can use it for analysis

290
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
after the elections

291
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
um so

292
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
they were convinced we this should be

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
maybe a project that is financed and we

294
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,399
got some financing to do this

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,480
but still

296
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
at this moment when we when we first

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
asked municipalities okay so this

298
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
website is necessary please publish your

299
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,079
voting stations on this website and we

300
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
created the standards to to do this in a

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
standardized way so other people could

302
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
reuse it

303
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,640
and exactly know what data to expect

304
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
50 of the municipalities

305
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
gave us their information

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
and we still had to collect the rest of

307
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
the 50 which was again a lot of work

308
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,720
um

309
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
and the rest the 50 that didn't publish

310
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
it would often say we've already

311
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
published the data it's already in a pdf

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
or we have our own screenshot of an of a

313
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
map or sometimes a nice interactive map

314
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
but many would

315
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
again it's it's a good it's a good

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
reason to say why should we duplicate

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
this data and this is again a technical

318
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,640
problem because well as many of you know

319
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
you don't want to duplicate data around

320
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
this gives a lot of issues

321
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
um

322
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
but we're not there yet and we're not at

323
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
the point where each municipality has

324
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
all its data available in a nice

325
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
standardized api that can be used you

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,480
know across all municipalities in in in

327
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
an easy ground job or anything

328
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,120
so we still need them to centrally

329
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
publish it to our website

330
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
um and by now 80 of the municipalities

331
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,519
do it

332
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
so that's that's already a big

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
improvement from the 50 that we started

334
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,720
at

335
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,079
um

336
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
another nice thing that you can do with

337
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
this data is uh now that you know the

338
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
exact locations of all the nearly ten

339
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,000
thousand polling stations in the

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
netherlands

341
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,519
when the election results are published

342
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
uh the location again of the of the

343
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
polling stations isn't shown but the

344
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
name is shown in the id of the of the

345
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
polling station so we can match

346
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
these and create amazing images which we

347
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
did together with the foxconns

348
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,079
for the last several years

349
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
so people can know how how do people

350
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
fold in this area

351
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,920
and this obviously wasn't possible if we

352
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
didn't get all this data standardized

353
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,800
and

354
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
available for the whole of the

355
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,319
netherlands

356
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
another

357
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
big topic that we've been working on for

358
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
10 years is the honda's register

359
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
the company register um the camera from

360
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
copenhall chamber of commerce in the

361
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
netherlands

362
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
um runs it

363
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
um but you have to pay so that's an

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
obstacle

365
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,519
uh that we wouldn't want there uh

366
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,120
i mean

367
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,079
this there's actually a lot of

368
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,279
external

369
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
uh companies that

370
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
invoke buy all this data and then sell

371
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
it as a subscription model for cheap but

372
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
then again you need a subscription or or

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,880
you just need to pay per view on each

374
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
company that you want the information on

375
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
so this is a huge obstacle on on a

376
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,399
public register

377
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
but it doesn't really feel public if if

378
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
you have these obstacles

379
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
um

380
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
so yes can we publish this and

381
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
the the what they say is it's too

382
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
expensive because once this is free and

383
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,639
then open

384
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,240
as open data

385
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
the chamber of commerce the kafika

386
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
uh probably loses about 40 or 50 million

387
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
in revenue each year which is a problem

388
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,160
for them because that's a big chunk of

389
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,279
their budget

390
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
um

391
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,360
so we would ask the manager the ministry

392
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,040
of economics which is

393
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
the the ministry that that

394
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,560
um

395
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
the kafika belongs to

396
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,320
um but the ministry so far also didn't

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,279
want

398
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,360
this changed and and it's in in a sense

399
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
it's easy they should just pay 40 or 50

400
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,639
million to the chamber of commerce

401
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,480
and then it can be opened

402
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,040
yes it's a lot of money but it's also a

403
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,399
lot of value that currently isn't

404
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,040
realized so how many people don't look

405
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
up information about the company and

406
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
make a wrong decision

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,040
um what kind of analyses could be done

408
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
with with this information that isn't

409
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
done at this moment what kind of fraud

410
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,199
or corruption is that could be protected

411
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
which is really hard to do because the

412
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
data isn't open

413
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
so yeah 40 50 million is a lot of money

414
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
but i guess there's probably more money

415
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,800
uh

416
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
lost at this moment because it isn't

417
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,399
open

418
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
and it can be open our neighbors in the

419
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
united kingdom have the company's house

420
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
and they just publish it they just

421
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,839
publish it all i mean this is google

422
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,399
you see the recent filings

423
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,880
view pdf and you you can view it it

424
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
feels so weird if you just have to pay

425
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,519
euros and do a transaction online in the

426
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,279
netherlands and here you can just click

427
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,959
it and search it and

428
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
um yeah so

429
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,079
it is possible it's just a choice and

430
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
a kind of political will that is

431
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
necessary in the netherlands for for it

432
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
to open up

433
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,519
um

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
a short slide that is related there's a

435
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
new register about companies that's the

436
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
ultimate beneficial ownership register

437
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,079
it's

438
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
mandated by the eu and

439
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,839
has come into action in past year um

440
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,240
but each country had their own choice in

441
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
how they implemented it and in the

442
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
netherlands again the

443
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,680
chamber of commerce the kafika managed

444
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
this manages this this register and

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
again they ask money for it

446
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
so i know a lot of people are annoyed

447
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
with having to fill in

448
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,399
that their uh

449
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
their ownership with their their company

450
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,759
or or their

451
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
organization they're part of

452
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
but i guess most of the value of this

453
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
data is again locked behind a paywall

454
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
um

455
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
moving on

456
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
the trader karma open data portal or the

457
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
house of representatives open data

458
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
portal in the netherlands

459
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
in 2012

460
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
the the the um

461
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
people at the house of representatives

462
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
the representatives

463
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
um voted to uh to open up all the

464
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
information that they they created

465
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
during their job so all the all the

466
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,279
amendments motions votings the questions

467
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,560
that are asked

468
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
um they said yeah we should just

469
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
digitally publish this all so people can

470
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,639
see this and and analyze it

471
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,079
um

472
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,040
but

473
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,320
it wasn't opened up in 2012 it was

474
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
opened up in 2016 so it took him four

475
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
years to to you know

476
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,240
get the it

477
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,560
working and and published this via an

478
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
api and and um

479
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
we were happy we were like okay it took

480
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,959
four years but now we can access it and

481
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,120
but then you apparently need to register

482
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
and you had your ip need white listed

483
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
before you could access it which is kind

484
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,000
of weird because why would you again

485
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
create obstacles for us to to access

486
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
this information

487
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,720
um

488
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,799
why they did this is because

489
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
the api was directly

490
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,839
linked to their their internal back-end

491
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
their internal database

492
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
so they thought well we must make sure

493
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,559
that not too many people access this

494
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,480
guess what many people access it and it

495
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
would cause their internal systems to

496
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
crash or slow down

497
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
so they closed it up in 2016.

498
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,600
and it took

499
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,919
six years i'm sorry i think you can see

500
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
it here but it took six years again

501
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,200
just last month they finally managed to

502
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
cache it in a cloud

503
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
and open up their api without obstacles

504
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
so yeah it took 10 years we're happy

505
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
with the end result but it took 10 years

506
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,640
which is insane and shows that there's

507
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,919
not a lot of

508
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
yeah political will or priority for this

509
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
information to be opened up

510
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,039
because it isn't that hard it's not like

511
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,640
a 10 year it project hard

512
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
another project of ours

513
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
lobbying so in 2018 um

514
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,039
the ministers ministers in the

515
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,000
netherlands decided to publish their

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
calendars there their meetings and

517
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
agendas which is a good idea

518
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
you could see

519
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
up front where they would be going and

520
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,160
and in the end you could analyze oh they

521
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
talk to these people and and and

522
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,799
well good idea and they publish it on

523
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
greg's override.now like the main

524
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,640
government website

525
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
last year a colleague of mine analyzed

526
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
this information

527
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,000
these are all the meetings per month in

528
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
the last couple of years

529
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,039
um

530
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,280
and we were looking at them we're like

531
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
some ministries obviously should have

532
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,840
more appointments than

533
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,960
this because

534
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,039
it would amount up to like a few

535
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,000
meetings

536
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
per week or something like that and that

537
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
wouldn't be a really productive minister

538
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
if that was true so obviously not all

539
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,840
the meetings were put online

540
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,640
um

541
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
in the last year you see that there's

542
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,520
again a spike so apparently our research

543
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
affected them to to you know more

544
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
proactively

545
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
uh publish their meetings on the website

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
um

547
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
but still

548
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,400
i'm confused with a site like this

549
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
the ministers most likely use

550
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
a calendar

551
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
tool maybe something from microsoft

552
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
maybe something from another vendor

553
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
these tools all use the icalendar

554
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
protocol and standard at the back end

555
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
and you know

556
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
this this can be easily shared online

557
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,679
and if you have a private meeting that

558
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,880
needs to be hidden you can make a

559
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
meeting hidden so why

560
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,679
do they ask their assistants to maybe

561
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
once a week put their information on a

562
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
website when they can just easily share

563
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,400
the calendar that they already have

564
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,559
so this is also a theme that i'll end

565
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
this talk with that

566
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
we should just keep it simple and use

567
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,039
open protocols which already exist

568
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
because many of these tasks aren't that

569
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,400
difficult and are already solved

570
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,080
related to this is the transparency

571
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,960
register in the european union so where

572
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
in the netherlands the ministers publish

573
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
their own

574
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
calendars

575
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,840
in the european union as a as a lobbyist

576
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,960
as someone that wants to talk to a

577
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
commissioner you first need to register

578
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
on their website which is interesting

579
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,600
there's like 12 000

580
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,960
people or companies registered

581
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,919
and you have

582
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,919
nice information because all these

583
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,600
companies or organizations have their

584
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,360
have an id so you can see how many times

585
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
they talked to a minister so in the end

586
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
i think it should be a combination of

587
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,559
both of these systems so just publish

588
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
the calendars

589
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
from your calendar tool

590
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
and also have some kind of id of all the

591
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
people that talk with with the the

592
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,110
ministers and commissioners

593
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,440
[Music]

594
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
a best example is

595
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,039
uh

596
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,039
the digital minister of taiwan audrey

597
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,159
tung

598
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,919
which is a prolific programmer by the

599
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,520
way and it's amazing that she's been a

600
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
minister for many years already and and

601
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,320
she's really pushing the transparency

602
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,039
uh yeah calls there

603
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
if you have an interview or a meeting

604
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,480
with audrey tong

605
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,400
it will be taped it will put will be put

606
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,520
on youtube so you're you're just having

607
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
a seat at the table you can hear

608
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
everything that's being said you can see

609
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
everything that's being said

610
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,919
um

611
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,520
yeah so

612
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
shout out to audrey tong and showing how

613
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,479
it should be done and what's possible

614
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
yeah

615
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,080
um

616
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
let's move on to freedom of information

617
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
requests uh in the netherlands it's

618
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
called that opability from the steer

619
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
which is the law that was just replaced

620
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
with the vet open overhead two months

621
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
ago

622
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
um

623
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
we did a research at the beginning of

624
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,320
this year together with uh partners of

625
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,200
ours

626
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
um and and take a look at the national

627
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
level how long it took for them to

628
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
publish

629
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
the documents requested by freedom of

630
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
information request

631
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,880
161 days

632
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
so that's like you're waiting half a

633
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,000
year

634
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
maybe even longer because this is an

635
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
average

636
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,679
um

637
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
four documents that you requested that

638
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
you have your legal right to

639
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,679
um these lines show the the uh the

640
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,320
maximum amount of days that legally they

641
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,600
have it's 56 with the old law and 42

642
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
days with the new law so yeah they're

643
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
gonna have

644
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,159
to work on on moving

645
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
their response time down

646
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
and i can understand why this is because

647
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
i talk to a lot of civil servants

648
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,360
and they say aha it's so annoying if

649
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
people ask this information i have to

650
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
look in in emo boxes of colleagues that

651
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,159
have left five years ago and i can't

652
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,760
even open the box and then i have to go

653
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
to all these network drives and

654
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,200
duplicate

655
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
documents and all these things so

656
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
obviously the information systems used

657
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
by the government aren't

658
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,080
equipped to quickly deal with freedom of

659
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,159
information requests

660
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
and there that's the big problem and

661
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,240
there's a good example of of

662
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,159
a country that can do it a lot faster as

663
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,960
you can see norway three days

664
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
how is this possible how can norway

665
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,240
it it just blows my mind so let's look

666
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
at norway we interviewed them

667
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
they have a great website that's called

668
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,240
a in i'm not sure if i pronounce it

669
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,919
correct which means something like

670
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
electronic insight transparency

671
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
and as you can see over here

672
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,840
64 million documents

673
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,960
and emails are directly searchable and

674
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
requestable via this website which is

675
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,120
great i mean the netherlands is working

676
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
on a website like this as well it has

677
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
like 200 000 documents and they're

678
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,360
having a big

679
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,980
big troubles with scaling this up

680
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,200
[Music]

681
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
i also love that that this is just like

682
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,080
a shopping cart so you can order

683
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
things which aren't directly accessible

684
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
on the system and it will go to your

685
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
shopping cart and you can just order as

686
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,720
much as you want because it's free

687
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,880
some documents are directly available

688
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,240
you can just open them up

689
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,440
here you see the shopping cart

690
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,679
and i've done this i've it they don't

691
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
restrict where you come from so i've

692
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
just requested many documents and with a

693
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,320
few days they sent you via email all the

694
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,039
documents and emails that that civil

695
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
servant sent it was

696
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
i was really amazed by how they do this

697
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
so how

698
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
does norway do this

699
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
well first of all they use a metadata

700
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,080
standard that's used across the

701
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,120
government

702
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
um obviously it's still working progress

703
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
it can be scaled up even even further

704
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
but they're a long way

705
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,480
um and it's it's it's a simple metadata

706
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
it's just you know what's the date of

707
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
this document

708
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,520
is there a subject or a title things

709
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
like this who's the owner

710
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,840
um but because it's standardized they

711
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
can publish it on their insane website

712
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,720
and make it searchable and requestable

713
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
and

714
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
then there's a culture of openness and

715
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
trust

716
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,320
the government in norway

717
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,600
trust society to you know

718
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
not know not be too

719
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,880
picky on

720
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
their their vulnerability by showing all

721
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
their information

722
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,440
um and

723
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
this is true i mean there's going to be

724
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
mistakes that's going to be

725
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
shown in this data and and

726
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,600
um

727
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,799
but by opening up all your information

728
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,960
you end up gaining trust and even if you

729
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
make mistakes

730
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,480
people will kind of accept it because

731
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,679
they know okay

732
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
obviously nobody is perfect government

733
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
can be perfect either so let's just um

734
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,799
maybe work with them and there's

735
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
probably scandals and things like this

736
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
and it could be better in norway also

737
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,679
but

738
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,120
it's it's a

739
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
positive circle where the government

740
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
trusts society and society trust

741
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,559
government and this is a big issue in

742
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,840
these days because

743
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,919
trust in government is i think going

744
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
down in many countries

745
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
so opening up

746
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
in norway has

747
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,279
reversed this trend or

748
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,799
made sure that this trend doesn't

749
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,279
doesn't happen there as much

750
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,360
then again transparency also has

751
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,000
priority so besides like a culture it's

752
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
also political will

753
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,440
if you get a freedom of information

754
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,600
request in norway you have to drop all

755
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
your other work and just handle the

756
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
request asap

757
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,559
um

758
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,440
even if if you if it takes too long or

759
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,679
if you don't open up everything

760
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,159
apparently they don't even

761
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,279
black out much of the of the documents

762
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
which is kind of seen as a as something

763
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
you don't do in norway whereas in the

764
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
netherlands

765
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,600
there's

766
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
many examples of documents that are

767
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,360
completely black because everything is

768
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,880
blacked out um but if if if citizen

769
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,320
isn't

770
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,520
uh happy with with the time uh it took

771
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
for this this information to be

772
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
published or the information that they

773
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,480
got they can file a complaint and this

774
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,880
complaint goes directly to the king

775
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
and every week the king

776
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,440
looks at these complaints and addresses

777
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,279
the ministers and saying

778
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,159
why why wasn't this information provided

779
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,960
so it's it's a way of

780
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
political will and courage in norway

781
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,440
which we in the netherlands at least can

782
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,159
can learn a lot from

783
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,120
um

784
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
so the final slides will be

785
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,919
more of a

786
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,039
yeah

787
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
thinking about where should we go what

788
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,360
what kind of inspiration do we need what

789
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,080
is possible what would make sense for

790
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
governments to work in the open because

791
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
at open state foundation we've focused a

792
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
lot on data sets but as you've seen with

793
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,840
these freedom of information

794
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,760
requests it's mainly also

795
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,440
documents and emails and text messages

796
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,279
which hold a lot of interest interesting

797
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,559
information about the functioning of

798
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,960
government

799
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
but this is a really messy kind of data

800
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,520
it's not a clean data set which you can

801
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,840
easily publish it it means that you have

802
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,960
to look at the yeah the structural

803
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
way that that government works and and

804
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,039
make sure that that's easily opened up

805
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
so inspiration number one gitlab

806
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,679
uh gitlab is is

807
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
quite well actually i'd say radically

808
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,919
transparent as a company it's just a

809
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
public company they create an open

810
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,640
source well git cloud platform obviously

811
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
and software platform

812
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
but they have a handbook which is is

813
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
well largely open you can just read

814
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,799
about all their internal

815
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,159
ways they work and decisions they make

816
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,279
they use

817
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
public trackers well let me just read

818
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,159
the quote

819
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,720
be open about as many things as possible

820
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
by making information public we can

821
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,960
reduce the threshold to contribution and

822
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
make collaboration easier

823
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
use public issue trackers public

824
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
projects and public repositories when

825
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,919
possible

826
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,039
so

827
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,559
because they codified this information

828
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,919
in their handbook and actively pursue it

829
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,000
they have a really open culture in quite

830
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
a large company by by now

831
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
another quote which i think is even more

832
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,760
interesting i'll read it

833
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,080
most companies become non-transparent

834
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
over time because they don't accept any

835
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,039
mistakes instead we should always err on

836
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
the side of transparency when there is a

837
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,480
choice to be made between caution or

838
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,279
inaction and transparency

839
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
and this this ties in great with the 50

840
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
shades of no list that i started with

841
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,159
because

842
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
if you don't actively

843
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,000
try to be transparent and open you

844
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,840
you feel the pain and the vulnerability

845
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
of being open and and

846
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,679
you'll close up again and and don't

847
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
publish anything anymore and

848
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
the default will be

849
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
non-transparency

850
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
um so gitlab

851
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,480
also like audrey tong publishes a lot of

852
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
stuff

853
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,120
on youtube

854
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
they they actively

855
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,919
ask their their um

856
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
people to you know

857
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
have like have their meetings live

858
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
streams on youtube and it's a company

859
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,919
that works mostly remote so

860
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,000
these their meetings are already online

861
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
and they just live stream them on

862
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
youtube and you can you can look them

863
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,679
back and it's insane there's like

864
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,840
thousands and thousands of videos and

865
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,120
many uh that are uploaded each day

866
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
yeah it's it's

867
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,039
great that they they are so transparent

868
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
and show that even a public company can

869
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,480
be this transparent

870
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
so a government which kind of has the

871
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,799
duty to be transparent

872
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,279
should be easily be able to do something

873
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,960
like this

874
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,679
another inspiration uh is of of course

875
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,519
you know successful open source projects

876
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,519
that work in the open for example linux

877
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,600
obviously i mean they do all their

878
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,320
communication via mailing lists it's

879
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,640
been doing this for 30 years

880
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,960
it's really successful

881
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,679
sure it's probably not perfect but

882
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,320
if if you know an organization like

883
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,880
linux can communicate this successfully

884
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
using just mailing lists

885
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,080
why can't government do this

886
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,519
and finally again back to my my favorite

887
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,519
minister in the world audrey tung in

888
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,360
taiwan

889
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
another example of her transparency is

890
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,360
that if you

891
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,080
ask

892
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,880
ask written questions by a email or ask

893
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,000
for a written interview she'll say

894
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,120
just post it on the forum

895
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,559
because i'll answer on the forum and

896
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
maybe other people can answer it as well

897
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,960
it's just so simple

898
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,200
why why shouldn't

899
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,519
information that is hidden in emails

900
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
just be open in a forum if you

901
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,840
communicate with government and well

902
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
audrey tong again is leading the way in

903
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
this

904
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
so to

905
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,399
finish up

906
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,880
keep it simple again question mark just

907
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
use open standards use open protocols

908
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,000
you use open source

909
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and just some crazy ideas i mean files

910
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
and documents at government why don't

911
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
they just use a public next cloud

912
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
instance how to hide the documents that

913
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
you don't want to publish or maybe

914
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,159
create an add-on that you can reject

915
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,320
some stuff but just start with next

916
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
cloud and i think you'll move along

917
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,360
really quickly with opening up

918
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
email again you know just use mailing

919
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,440
lists public mailing lists chats

920
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
jet isn't used as much in government i

921
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,279
think but if they use chat they use text

922
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,080
messages or whatsapp not good

923
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,158
maybe just use a public matrix instance

924
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,159
so in the end open government requires

925
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,320
courage from top down from ministers

926
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,399
it sounds really crazy that it's

927
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,320
something like courage that is necessary

928
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,880
but if the ministers don't show that

929
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,360
there's a political will to open up

930
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,600
it won't happen and norway is doing this

931
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,279
already quite well

932
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,880
then again you also need courage from

933
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
bottom up you need civil servants and i

934
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,080
know many of them that are already

935
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
working on this

936
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,000
that actively try to push the agenda of

937
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,519
opening up and publish publishing

938
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,960
information that isn't published at this

939
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,799
moment and asking questions why it isn't

940
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,000
possible and most important i think even

941
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
is pressure from society

942
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,919
i'd say that transparency

943
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,399
organizations aren't as

944
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,919
as

945
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,519
as well known or as visible or as maybe

946
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
as sexy as privacy organization for

947
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,120
privacy digital rights

948
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,080
but

949
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,519
i think that we always said open state

950
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,760
foundation is

951
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,000
government shouldn't know much about

952
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
citizens so that's what privacy

953
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,240
organizations do what we do is making

954
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,000
sure that citizens know much about the

955
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,519
government and you need both to to be

956
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,000
in a healthy healthy

957
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,519
just society

958
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,279
so support your local

959
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
local digital rights uh digital

960
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,760
transparency and open data ngo uk has

961
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,679
the great my society

962
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,440
uh germany and belgium have the open

963
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,719
knowledge foundation and they're also in

964
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,719
finland and many other chapters france

965
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,719
has a regards

966
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,040
access info in spain and also

967
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,359
they work at a lot of stuff in europe

968
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,440
open policy in italy well in every

969
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,760
country or region there there is an

970
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
organization working on this

971
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,320
but don't take it for granted sunlight

972
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,399
foundation used to be the biggest 50

973
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,800
people working there in 2012 they are

974
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,599
gone now since two years so

975
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,679
i mean this isn't because transparency

976
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
is solved in the us

977
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,280
it's kind of weird that especially in

978
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
the us sunlight foundation just died and

979
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,119
that's a shame so support your local ngo

980
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,159
that's it

981
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,480
thanks for listening

982
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,119
thank you very much we've got time for a

983
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,680
few questions um and if people could ask

984
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
questions at the microphone as someone

985
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
is and also seeing as we're competing

986
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,160
with the flamers and the music please

987
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
kiss the microphone almost kiss it and

988
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,599
be nice and clear

989
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,280
so yeah go ahead

990
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,800
thanks for the presentation um i i work

991
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
with some civil servants in a

992
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
municipality in the netherlands

993
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,520
and they are opening up to our place for

994
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,720
well open source and opening up etc

995
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,760
but i have the impression that when they

996
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,079
bring this up in their own organization

997
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,040
they meet it managers that give them the

998
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
50 shades of no

999
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,640
and then they are kind of

1000
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,440
helpless because they are not tax heavy

1001
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,160
i.t experts themselves so they don't

1002
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
have an adequate reply right

1003
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
do you have any resources

1004
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
that i could pass on that could help

1005
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,320
them like

1006
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,560
the the arguments that are really

1007
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
compelling that they could bring up

1008
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
internally and maybe

1009
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,960
a cookbook of solutions that might help

1010
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
the it manager that they would have to

1011
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,680
confront that's a good good question and

1012
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
it's difficult to to directly answer

1013
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
because i don't know the the the

1014
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,359
specific questions that are happening in

1015
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,680
this case but there's there's like i

1016
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,119
said 50 shades of no i think it's

1017
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,119
actually 46 but you know there's many

1018
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
reasons to say no

1019
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
and there's also many answers and like

1020
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
as i've shown with the projects that

1021
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,440
we've that were successful or partly

1022
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
successful or not successful

1023
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,599
it's it it takes like a specific

1024
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,680
approach in each case

1025
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
so i'd be happy to talk to you uh about

1026
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
some of the specifics

1027
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
that you that you run into and maybe

1028
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
have a look at that

1029
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,400
i can add one little thing to that

1030
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,880
sometimes one thing i found dealing with

1031
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
government is rather than asking for

1032
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
permission

1033
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
um ask for objections and if you ask for

1034
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,119
do you have any objections to publishing

1035
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,800
this information they have to give

1036
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
specific reasons

1037
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,119
and you can then go against those but

1038
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,160
maybe that maybe that's the first yeah

1039
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
that's also good but yeah then you

1040
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
exactly know what's wrong and

1041
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,000
work on that yeah yeah

1042
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
go sorry next question

1043
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,640
yeah i'm thinking about what you just

1044
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
said but uh

1045
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
oh sorry no

1046
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
oh you might need to take your mask off

1047
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,720
just to speak

1048
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
i think so yeah because i mean

1049
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
government doesn't have to reply to you

1050
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
actually so

1051
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
but that's something else so my question

1052
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,839
is because you mentioned norway and you

1053
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,640
mentioned uh taiwan i think

1054
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,640
but these seem like outliers i mean

1055
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
in my opinion

1056
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,480
my view i think what happens in the

1057
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,040
netherlands is actually pretty normal so

1058
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
are there other outliers or good

1059
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,480
examples

1060
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
well yeah that's true there

1061
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
are definitely outliers and it's i

1062
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
wouldn't i i'd say

1063
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
the open data and digital transparency

1064
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,599
movement is

1065
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,520
about 15 years old

1066
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
and the first

1067
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,560
well five to ten years was basically

1068
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,359
just telling what the idea of open data

1069
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,079
was and it took a lot of effort to get

1070
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,680
this this idea

1071
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,839
you know known across governments

1072
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,279
in the past seven years i'd say

1073
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,680
most people in government know about

1074
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,440
being digitally transparent and know the

1075
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,520
term open data so

1076
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,000
that is definitely progress and more

1077
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,720
data has been published

1078
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,320
so i think the trend is in the right

1079
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
direction

1080
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,160
but it could be much faster and

1081
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,960
these these outliers like norway and

1082
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,119
parts of taiwan because it's only audrey

1083
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,040
tong well taiwan is doing great at many

1084
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,359
places but audrey is it's also an idle

1085
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,960
outlier within taiwan um

1086
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
yeah

1087
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
yeah so your question is

1088
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,839
are there more outliers um

1089
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,839
yeah there there's good examples in many

1090
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,160
countries i mean the uk is doing great

1091
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,440
at some place

1092
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,000
in some cases in u.s as well

1093
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,160
um but it changes a lot over time um

1094
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,359
yeah

1095
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,400
i think it's going in the right

1096
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
direction but maybe we can talk

1097
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
afterwards as well and then

1098
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,119
discuss some more thanks

1099
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
examples you gave

1100
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,520
the

1101
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,000
company register kavika and uber

1102
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,400
register that is about

1103
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
individuals

1104
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
do you talk to bits of freedom about the

1105
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,240
privacy implications of what you're

1106
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
striving for because there definitely

1107
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
are privacy implications lots of

1108
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
independent workers here at camp know

1109
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,240
that they're you you get spammed to

1110
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,119
death once you're in the register yeah

1111
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,079
and uber is even worse with unforeseen

1112
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,680
consequences where people are actually

1113
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
leaving the netherlands because they're

1114
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,599
afraid of the well-being of their

1115
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,320
children and family yeah now those those

1116
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,599
are are

1117
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,520
valid valid criticisms

1118
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,560
um

1119
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
starting with the company register

1120
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
i mean every country has a company

1121
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,319
register so this is just

1122
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,319
a register that is necessary for a

1123
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,160
functioning economy um

1124
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,400
it is already a public register it's

1125
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
just made

1126
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,520
more public for people with a lot of

1127
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,880
money

1128
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,680
so

1129
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
to level the playing field i think it

1130
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
makes much more sense if

1131
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
the the pay wall is removed

1132
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,079
again there's in the netherlands

1133
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,599
specifically there's a lot of private

1134
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
information in this uh

1135
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,119
honda's history in the competition

1136
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,359
register i think they're trying to fix

1137
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,920
this slowly but surely uh to remove as

1138
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,960
much of this

1139
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,800
uh really personal information and just

1140
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,560
you know keep the the company

1141
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,400
information left uh leave that leave

1142
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,079
that information and make sure that

1143
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
that's available so

1144
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,400
your first question

1145
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
ubo registers

1146
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
um yes this is this is actually

1147
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,119
information about people that own parts

1148
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,040
of companies or organizations

1149
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,520
um

1150
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
it's still interesting to see that some

1151
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
countries in europe

1152
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,880
are much more open with this data and

1153
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,880
the the the yeah the fears of

1154
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,319
uh

1155
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,839
will these people be harassed or uh or

1156
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,359
things like this

1157
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,839
they don't seem to be a big problem and

1158
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
even if there is like a really

1159
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
legitimate concern about the person's

1160
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,680
person's safety

1161
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,200
some countries have like a clause that

1162
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
they could hide their information but

1163
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,040
they have to show that they're you know

1164
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
targeted explicitly

1165
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,720
so

1166
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,960
i'd rather say let's try to open up and

1167
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
see if it's a big problem in other

1168
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,079
countries it doesn't appear to be a big

1169
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,040
problem

1170
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,520
and it is a lot of really interesting

1171
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
information

1172
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,720
to know who actually owns a company or

1173
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,800
who actually owns multiple companies who

1174
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
is the person behind

1175
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,760
certain certain interests

1176
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,800
so yeah it's definitely

1177
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,560
something to balance

1178
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,280
but i'd say again let's try to be more

1179
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,440
open instead of closing up because

1180
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,839
that's the easy way to to do and it's

1181
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,599
it's it takes a lot more effort to open

1182
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,520
up and stay open

1183
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,319
thanks

1184
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,240
of course at first thanks for the talk

1185
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
and thanks for everything you said and i

1186
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
was just wondering about are there any

1187
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,960
uh do you have any tips or any

1188
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,400
steps to follow because what you say

1189
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
it's it's like information it's like

1190
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,319
awareness about transparency

1191
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,760
it's not the willingness to not be

1192
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,839
transparent it's mostly awareness and

1193
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,520
sometimes religious but most of the time

1194
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,720
just

1195
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,200
the effort it takes like you said are

1196
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,359
there any tips or anything civil

1197
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,680
servants could do to

1198
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,800
promote or of make poor people aware of

1199
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,520
transparency or any steps to follow to

1200
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,680
make sure that you work as transparent

1201
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,079
as possible yeah good good question well

1202
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,640
mainly what i ended with so so

1203
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,560
uh we have an international crowd here

1204
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,359
uh

1205
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,760
support your local digital transparency

1206
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,040
ngo uh or or sometimes they're regional

1207
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
but there's always uh an organization

1208
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,960
focusing on on a country or region

1209
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,319
you know subscribe to their mailing

1210
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,240
lists donate

1211
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,680
i mean i think open state foundation

1212
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
just has a handful of monthly donors

1213
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,920
which isn't a lot so

1214
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,359
more would be would be awesome

1215
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,119
and just spread awareness just talk to

1216
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,640
people um

1217
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,720
yeah um maybe

1218
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,880
you if you're a developer

1219
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,560
work together with these ngos because

1220
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,160
it's often a lot of technical stuff that

1221
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,680
needs to be done if you're not a

1222
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,599
developer freedom of information

1223
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
requests are really easy there's often

1224
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,560
even tools my society builds a great

1225
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,800
tool called what do they know and it's

1226
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,359
been ported to many countries

1227
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,760
and you it's just a click of a button to

1228
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,040
to request information and you know

1229
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,960
publish it put it

1230
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,160
on a

1231
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,960
on a website link to it on twitter or

1232
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
or muscledon or whatever and then you

1233
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,920
know

1234
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,319
try to open things up but uh yeah i

1235
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,680
think there are quite some steps to be

1236
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,960
taken so thanks

1237
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,040
