[Music]

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,119
anybody who speaks about banking or for

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,039
that matter and especially economists in

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
economics should put up a warm warning

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,720
like this um

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
i'm going to be talking you know

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
quite a bit about economics and economic

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
theory but

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,558
mostly disparity i'm afraid because a

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
lot of economic theory is well pretty

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,600
bad

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,960
and

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,559
i'm going to also advocate that one of

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,320
the reasons for it being bad is actually

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,680
that you know economics has been

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,239
avoiding the banking system

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,440
and so we're going to talk quite a lot

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,800
about the banking system where it comes

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,079
from and

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
hopefully at the end of this talk you

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,000
will have a better understanding of it

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
why it causes problems and at some level

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,879
how to at least anticipate them in your

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,120
personal life

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
but what ultimately you're seeing here

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,760
is what happens if you know a computer

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
network tech engineer gets really

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
interested in what is essentially a

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
medieval

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
network the banking system decides you

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
know because it actually was a rainy

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
weekend to sort of try to build a simple

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,439
simulation of the economic textbook so i

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
could understand it better this is

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
usually how i get myself into trouble

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
and discovered that actually the

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
economic textbook the standard example

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
can't actually work as shown

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
which is kind of interesting to find in

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
a textbook so you know then i got a bit

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
more interested in it and discovered how

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
it really worked and talked to quite a

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
lot of bankers who were surprisingly

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
helpful

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
and

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
built what is as far as i am aware

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
the first

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
banking simulation and economic

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
simulation that actually faithfully

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
implements the double-entry bookkeeping

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,200
protocol that the banking system uses so

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,799
believe me or don't believe me you know

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
but i do think i have a fair claim to

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
understanding how the system works just

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,799
because i built a working copy and you

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
are welcome to uh go to the public

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,720
version of it we do have a developmental

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
version that's quite a bit further

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
forward um get it working with the

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
latest version of java um download it

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
and play with it and i warn you now it's

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
research code so

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
you may need to email me if you need

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
some help doing any of that but several

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
long suffering classes at reykjavik

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
university have downloaded it run it and

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,599
found out just how easy it is to crash

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,840
the banking

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,120
system and it's at this point when i'm

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,200
talking at economics conferences i get

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
start getting very strange looks from

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,080
economists

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
um so we'll start talking a little bit

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
uh about how the banking system actually

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
works and

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
you know how we

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
reproduced it and why it keeps crashing

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
um and just to sort of you know

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
prequel it i guess

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
what we did with the system i called

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
fred needle once we got it up and

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
working and had implemented double entry

83
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,519
bookkeeping and you know could basically

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,400
have

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
multiple banks and look at the

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
transactions between them

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
was we isolated it so

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
the problem with any form of economic

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,319
simulation

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,720
is you need to create some kind of flow

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
of money around the system you know

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
banks create loans they create money in

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
the process we'll get to that in a

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
moment

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,720
but somebody then has to repay that loan

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
usually ask but you know companies take

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,760
out loans all the time as well so do

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
governments

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
um governments quite often don't repay

100
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
them that can be a problem

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
and

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
that money that you're using has to come

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
from somebody well it probably comes

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,360
from a company and that company has to

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,879
hopefully be selling something for a

106
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
profit to give you that money and so you

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
have to create these complicated loops

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
of monetary flows

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
and that's quite difficult to do and

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
still just figure out what is just the

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
banking systems behavior and what is the

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
economy's behavior

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,439
so

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
we isolated the banking system

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
very simply actually by just creating a

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,920
borrower who was paid a salary by the

117
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,200
bank

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
that matched the amount of money that

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
they needed to pay their debt in any

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,358
given simulation state and we just

121
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880
looked at that for for a couple of years

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,478
what we did was just look at how banks

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
behave if it's a completely closed

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
system not how it is in real life

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
and

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,280
you know borrowers are repaying their

127
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
debt and we played with different uh

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
regulatory frameworks and so on and saw

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
what happened

130
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
so

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
let's go back to where we began

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
the textbook

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
uh description of the banking system

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
still in the textbook still in wikipedia

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
and honestly wikipedia gets worse every

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,639
time i look at it

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
um originates with the british economist

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
john maynard keynes who is writing a

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
report to the british parliament in 1931

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
on the big banking crash that europe and

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
the united states is just experiencing

142
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
and he gives this rather convoluted

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
example and he makes a couple of

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
assumptions and one of the assumptions

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,400
he makes which turns out to be very

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
important

147
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,479
is that there is only one bank

148
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,360
so

149
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
that actually gets rid of a problem

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
which we'll talk about in a moment which

151
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
is you know how do you transfer money

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
between banks that's actually quite

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
tricky that's as soon as you have to

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
transfer money between banks you run

155
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
straight into consensus problems

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
and anybody who's done distributed

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
computing maybe you've heard of the

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
fisher consensus problem it is

159
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
impossible

160
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
in that situation to guarantee that any

161
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
two

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,120
asynchronously connected nodes can agree

163
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
on even a single bit value and the

164
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,520
single bit value in in question here is

165
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
your bank account and people generally

166
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
get very upset if that does not match

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
what they want it to

168
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,199
um so you know

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
that problem has to be solved so keynes

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
basically said don't worry about that

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
we'll just look at this you know money

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
creation thing that they do and you know

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,280
i'm trying to explain it to politicians

174
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
trust me i'm an expert

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
so 60 or 70 years later

176
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
um the textbook model of fractional

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
reserve banking is sort of appearing

178
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
like this

179
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
uh sometime in the 60s somebody in the

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
federal reserve thought it would be

181
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
better to take keynes's single bank

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
example and sort of split it out over a

183
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
whole bunch of banks

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,319
and basically hopefully to make it

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
clearer

186
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
and so what he's showing with this

187
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
example is the problem that everybody

188
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
sort of screams about with the banking

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
system the money out of thin air problem

190
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
you know banks create money which they

191
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
do they also destroy it this might

192
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
actually be a larger problem

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,280
and banks create money every time they

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,479
make a loan

195
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,440
so

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
somebody took the keynesian example

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
broke it out so that bank a made a loan

198
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
ended up in bank b bank b makes a loan

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
where the deposited money lends up in

200
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,919
bank c and so on and actually 20 years

201
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,840
later and on wikipedia not in the

202
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
textbooks a computer scientist came

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
along said oh yeah that's a recursive

204
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,039
equation

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,160
and it should stabilize to this and so

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
economic theory being misled essentially

207
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
fundamentally by the federal reserve and

208
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
john maynard keynes

209
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
is predominantly based on the assumption

210
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
that the money supply is stable

211
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
it might go through an initial expansion

212
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
series theory um phase but you know this

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
is back sometime in the 1700s 1800s

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,880
but now it's stable and so we can ignore

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
it you know we have a stable money

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
supply

217
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
we know that you know supply and demand

218
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
and market trading which we've based all

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
of our sort of systems on is a function

220
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
of the money supply i mean prices depend

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
on the amount of money you can pay for

222
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,560
something demand is expressed as money

223
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
and the supply but we're just going to

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
assume the money supply stable and that

225
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
will be fine and maybe if the money

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
supply was stable it would be

227
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
i don't know

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,479
we've actually run we can run

229
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,639
simulated economies with very stable

230
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
money supplies i'll talk about that in a

231
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
moment and we still have problems

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
so there's more going on with this than

233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
just the banking system for sure but

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
let's start with the thing that we can

235
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
easily focus on

236
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
how do we know the banking system isn't

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,120
stable well um keynes didn't or he kind

238
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
of did actually if you look at the

239
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
numbers in the back of the report he's

240
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,199
got about 10 years of economic data and

241
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
you can sort of see that it's changing

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
but they didn't really have statistics

243
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,919
in the way we have them now whereas now

244
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,519
you can go to pretty much every central

245
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
bank in the world and you will find

246
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,719
either an m2 or an m3 a money supply

247
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
series and for every single country it

248
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
will look something like that

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
continuously expanding but this is the

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
fun part expanding at different rates

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,040
this is a problem for the euro

252
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
um each banking system in each country

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,279
and sometimes in different parts of the

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
same country which also causes problems

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
it tends to expand its local money

256
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,519
supply its local lending supply at a

257
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,800
different rate

258
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
now

259
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,200
this is a very very slow system by human

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
standards it's glacial

261
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
all the interesting behavior in it is

262
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
actually linked to lending

263
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
and loans can be quite long you know a

264
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
typical loan period if you're buying a

265
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,720
house is you know 20 25 30 years go and

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,160
look at the annual reports of all the

267
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
companies these days they've all got you

268
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
know 30 40-year loans on their books

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
so

270
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
the behavior evolves over time with the

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
lending and that takes decades

272
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
so

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
a common theme in economics over the

274
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
years and something that cryptocurrency

275
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
latched onto

276
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
is that we would like to have you know

277
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
fixed

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
currencies that have the same value with

279
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,959
respect to each other

280
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,480
because this solves a lot of problems

281
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
you know if i'm running a restaurant and

282
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
i'm trying to import spices every month

283
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,839
and i'm trying to price my meals

284
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,440
accordingly well it'd be nice if those

285
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
prices stayed the same and of course

286
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
they don't because foreign exchange

287
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
happens and banking systems are

288
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
expanding the money supply at different

289
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
rates so you know there's always these

290
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,040
you know changes going on in foreign

291
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
currency

292
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040
so you know every so often basically

293
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
economists try they've tried with the

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
euro and they used to they used to be

295
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,079
trying with something called the bretton

296
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
woods accord to fix

297
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,360
currency uh relationships to each other

298
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
across the different currencies and this

299
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
is okay for about 10 15 20 years

300
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
depending on the expansion rates

301
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,959
but ultimately it's destined to break

302
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,320
and because you know they're all

303
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
expanding at different rates think of a

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
carpet think of a carpet where the

305
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
threads of different parts of the carpet

306
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,279
are expanding at a different rate that's

307
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
essentially what's happening when you're

308
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
looking at different banking systems

309
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,680
and this is the uk

310
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
the uk was a three times a decade

311
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,920
country you know and i tend to measure

312
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
it by how many times in a decade the

313
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
money supply uh increases the us up to

314
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
recently was a two times a decayed

315
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,399
country

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,519
um

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,360
stability is sort of like the two to

318
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
three value the germans are very stable

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
so the japanese they're down at like

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
1.25

321
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
the russians well uh they've had to

322
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
re-value the year the ruble i think

323
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
about six times last time i checked um

324
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
everybody else is somewhere in the

325
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
middle

326
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
um

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
it's quite interesting that from 2009

328
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,640
onwards uh the uk sort of stabilized and

329
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,959
then is increasing again

330
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,880
um i don't know what it means i don't

331
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
know if it was deliberate or not

332
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,760
but it's

333
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
changing something very fundamental in

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
the entire economy

335
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
all right so how does this actually

336
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,839
happen

337
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,360
well

338
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
these guys discovered statistical

339
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
multiplexing

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
they discovered it

341
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
essentially in the 14th century or so

342
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,839
banking is based on a very old

343
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,760
technology i would say protocol

344
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
basically called double entry

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,399
bookkeeping

346
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,480
and in computer science words double

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
entry bookkeeping is essentially a

348
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
single error correction detection

349
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,639
protocol

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,440
so

351
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
from the perspective of people who have

352
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
to run companies and want to sort of add

353
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
up all the numbers and make sure that

354
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
you know nobody's committed any fraud

355
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,399
and that they've bought about the right

356
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
number of things it's a nice simple way

357
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
to do that and correct any errors and

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
essentially the way it works is you take

359
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,079
two people you give each of them a book

360
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
and each transaction the company makes

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
whether if it sells something to

362
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
somebody if it buys something

363
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
both people write an entry in their

364
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
books at the end of the day they add up

365
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,720
the totals and hopefully they are the

366
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
same if they're not at least the problem

367
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
is localized

368
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
so the books are classified as assets or

369
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,720
liabilities and equity and the operation

370
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,040
is called a debit and a credit except

371
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
that the meaning of debit and the

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
meaning of credit mathematically changes

373
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
depending on which side you're on

374
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
the way to remember this if you care is

375
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
the right hand side is what you think it

376
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,440
is credit adds

377
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,600
and the left hand side isn't on the

378
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
left-hand side a debit ads and the

379
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
credits of tracks

380
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
and because that is done that way it

381
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,639
works it's actually quite a nice system

382
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,760
so

383
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
back in medieval times

384
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the goldsmiths basically sort of started

385
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
setting up and providing places to store

386
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
gold for the rich people let's face it

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
it wasn't a large number of people who

388
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,959
had gold in those days

389
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,480
and they were using double entry

390
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
bookkeeping to do this and so you would

391
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
turn up you would deposit your gold

392
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,440
and you would get

393
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
a single

394
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
basically a depositor account in there

395
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,160
and they would give you a chit

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
looked like this back in sweden in the

397
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,199
1700s

398
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,040
and that would basically say i have

399
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
a deposit of gold with this goalkeeper

400
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
now here's the thing with gold it's not

401
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
like a pawn shop

402
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
you're not going in there saying here's

403
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
my shirt i want my shirt back

404
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,399
you're just going in and saying i want a

405
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,079
certain quantity of gold back and i

406
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
don't really care you know whose gold it

407
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,279
was originally just as long as i get

408
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,800
that back right it's perfectly

409
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
reasonable

410
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
it's also the 1700s

411
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,760
it's 200 years before anyone is going to

412
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
invent police services so basically the

413
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
rich people realize quite quickly i

414
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,360
imagine that they are now going to a

415
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
well-known location taking out a heavy

416
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
uh valuable metal and trying to get a

417
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
way of anyone noticing

418
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
so very quickly uh people stop going to

419
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
the goldsmith and start just signing

420
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
these chits over to each other

421
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
so basically you know you would give it

422
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
to your friend it's yours and this very

423
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
rapidly evolves into being cash money

424
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
obviously that makes sense

425
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,480
and

426
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,839
meanwhile

427
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,440
the goldsmiths are kind of like okay

428
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,639
well we've got all this gold here and

429
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,399
nobody seems to be coming in for it

430
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,279
right

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
um

432
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
okay i mean you know let's be honest

433
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,040
about this they were probably the

434
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,839
hackers of their time

435
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
um you know what can we do well we can

436
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,760
make short-term loans right why not

437
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
nobody wants it

438
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
we'll just use our nice double-entry

439
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
bookkeeping technology we'll write 30 in

440
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
the loan ledger um and we'll charge some

441
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
interest on that so we get something for

442
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
ourselves we'll make a liability deposit

443
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
for them and we'll give them a cheat for

444
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
you know 30 more gold and as long as not

445
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
too many people come in on any given day

446
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
and want their gold back that's going to

447
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,839
work just fine and it does

448
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,040
actually um

449
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
the problem although it's not the

450
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,240
popular view of the problem the problem

451
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,279
that you know

452
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,560
a lot of people turn up and want their

453
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
gold is just actually not usually the

454
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
real problem that's going on

455
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,560
um i'll talk about in a moment but let

456
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,639
me just draw your attention to something

457
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
as soon as you've got this set up and it

458
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
emerges you know over about 30 or 40

459
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,000
years

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,079
you've basically got two forms of money

461
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
the sort of the physical kind that

462
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
everybody can relate to but in today's

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,880
terms on this side of the books

464
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,680
you've created virtual money

465
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,279
i mean it's actually a huge argument

466
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
with quite a few of the more obtuse

467
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,480
economists um you know is this money

468
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
even money well let's just say let's

469
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
just regard money as a token of exchange

470
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
nothing else store value forget it

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
as a token of exchange

472
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,759
absolutely this is money because what

473
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
happens very shortly after the chits get

474
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,480
invented is that the goldsmiths start

475
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
taking checks and basically you can just

476
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,639
write an instruction to the goldsmith

477
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,399
and say transfer my money to my friend

478
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
and you know it all happens on that side

479
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
of the book

480
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,720
um so you know it is being used as money

481
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
there's no question about that it

482
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
doesn't leave the goldsmith

483
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
and so you've now got two forms of money

484
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,199
in the economy one is virtual and one is

485
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,320
physical and about 300 years of complete

486
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,959
confusion for the economist

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
it's statistically multiplexing so it's

488
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
going to kind of work most of the time

489
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
but if too many people want their gold

490
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,160
at the same time it's a problem

491
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
now

492
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
the one final problem they have to solve

493
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
from a networking perspective for

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
basically what is if you just regard the

495
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
money transmission side of this a very

496
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,439
elegant

497
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
uh form of networking i would say

498
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,919
is they need to be able to transfer

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,880
deposits from one bank or goldsmith but

500
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
at this point of time they are now

501
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
becoming banks

502
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,799
to another

503
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,319
and of course when you do that you run

504
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,199
straight into consensus problems okay so

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
what the banks actually do is they

506
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
transfer cash

507
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,840
so they take the physical form of the

508
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,559
money and

509
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,039
they deduct that from your deposit they

510
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
deduct the cash and at least for a while

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
they physically send the cash over to

512
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
the other bank

513
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
this is why if you sort of see 1960s

514
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
1950s american criminal films they're

515
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
always robbing bank fans that's what the

516
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,720
bank fans are doing

517
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
over in the british empire

518
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
essentially you had a clearing

519
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
meeting the bank clerks would run around

520
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
to all the other banks with the checks

521
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
and things that they needed to balance

522
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,880
out bank clerks are energetic young men

523
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
they weren't stupid either

524
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
they quickly realized that what they

525
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,000
should do is all meet at a central

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
location

527
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
so the lombard street tavern the second

528
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
floor of which they would all meet up

529
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,240
there and they would basically all

530
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,679
balance out the clearing between each

531
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,480
other

532
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,960
and it took 50 years

533
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
for anybody apparently in management to

534
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
notice that all the clearing operations

535
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,039
were being done down the pub

536
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,240
and when they did they got their own

537
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
premises

538
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
so you've got checks you've got physical

539
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,919
cash being used as a transfer you've got

540
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,960
mechanisms to balance up you've got a

541
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
network and you've got something that's

542
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
actually very important for a modern

543
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
economy which is ways to transfer money

544
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,160
between people that you know are

545
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
relatively robust um and allow

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
commercial enterprise to occur

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
so what about all this lending

548
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
the the the thing that you know when

549
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,799
you're watching the youtube video the

550
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
vaguely anti-semitic tone usually starts

551
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,799
to come in on

552
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
um

553
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
it's it's an emergent you can see why

554
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,919
they did this i don't think there was

555
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,600
any conspiracy involved i mean it makes

556
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
it actually makes sense they sort of

557
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,440
stumbled over a way to create a network

558
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
but the problem was in some sense it's

559
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,280
embedded in the bookkeeping and you

560
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,160
really need to understand the

561
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
bookkeeping to appreciate what happens

562
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
when they create the money they

563
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
basically create a loan and they put the

564
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
sort of money in the deposit account

565
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
and when you repay the loan this is what

566
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,280
tends to get left out in a lot of cases

567
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
is you know what happens when you repay

568
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,360
it

569
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
hopefully you do

570
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
um well the capital the amount you

571
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
borrowed that is debited uh sorry

572
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
credited because it's on the left-hand

573
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,559
side and

574
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,039
that shrinks the amount you owe

575
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,280
and then your deposit account is also

576
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
debit uh debited

577
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
um and that shrinks the amount of money

578
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
that you have it also shrinks the total

579
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
amount of money in the whole system

580
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
so banks create money sure but they're

581
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
also destroying it all the time and

582
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,039
that's where the system can get a little

583
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,400
bit quantum

584
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
and then when you pay interest well that

585
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
just basically is a transfer from your

586
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,559
account to either the bank's account or

587
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
somebody else's account if it wasn't a

588
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
bank that lent you money in the first

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,159
place

590
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
so what goes wrong with this system

591
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
well what happens if you don't repay the

592
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
loan

593
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,320
that's this last one

594
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
the bookkeeping is straightforward you

595
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
credit the loan you write the loan off

596
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,080
hopefully there was some collateral with

597
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
that which you can take and sell and

598
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
recover your money as a bank but that

599
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
might not work so well

600
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,200
you

601
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,760
strictly then have to debit your profits

602
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
you basically write off that amount that

603
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
you owed that was owed to you you're not

604
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
going to get it back unless you can sell

605
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
the collateral so you deduct that from

606
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,280
your profits

607
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,640
okay

608
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
what happens if there aren't enough

609
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,200
profits

610
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,960
and also by the way you've just

611
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,480
destroyed some money because profits are

612
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,679
also money it's just the money that the

613
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,159
bank earned and what you're doing

614
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,159
well this is fundamentally what causes a

615
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,880
credit crisis

616
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
it's the economic consequence of an

617
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,480
interruption in the credit supply from

618
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
banks i mean it could be there are other

619
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,400
people in the economy lending

620
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,159
but it's only the banks who interact

621
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,640
directly with the money supply and so if

622
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
the banks stop lending and they stop

623
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
creating money

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
and the money supply starts shrinking

625
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,600
that has global and very unpleasant

626
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
economic consequences

627
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,520
so the expanded accounting equation

628
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
basically says that loan defaults are

629
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
treated as an expense

630
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
so you deduct it from income

631
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,880
and

632
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,400
you know if you've got a really big loss

633
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
then you're not going to be paying any

634
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,320
dividends and if that comes out negative

635
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,679
then you're going to start deducting

636
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
from equity well equity includes things

637
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,360
like

638
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
loss provisions and so on so maybe

639
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
that's not so bad

640
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
but fundamentally as soon as this

641
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
happens as soon as you can't cover your

642
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
losses with income

643
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
you start interacting with all the

644
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
controls that over time people have put

645
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,880
on this mechanism to stop it expanding

646
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
the money supply too fast

647
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,280
because we know what happens to about to

648
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
a country where the money supply

649
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
expands without any regulation it's

650
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
called the weimar republic the viola

651
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,039
hyper inflation the zimbabwean

652
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
hyperinflation the icelandic

653
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
hyperinflation of uh 1970's 1982.

654
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,200
um

655
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
it basically that's actually the

656
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
quickest and fastest way to destroy the

657
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
entire financial system that anyone's

658
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
comes up with and the social

659
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
consequences usually afterwards are

660
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
disastrous

661
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
okay so how bad can it be how much loan

662
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,679
defaults can the banking system absorb

663
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,200
in a year

664
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,039
well and that's the problem and the math

665
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,919
is very is surprisingly easy to do

666
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
so i don't know why this isn't pointed

667
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,640
out more often but it doesn't seem to be

668
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
banks profits are essentially take the

669
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
total amount of interest they can get on

670
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
their loans

671
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,799
take the total amount of interest they

672
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
have to pay on their savings accounts

673
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,159
so you know banks don't really make

674
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,600
profits in the way that a lot of

675
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,159
companies do they live on the spread

676
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,840
between lending and

677
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,679
savings so this can vary a little bit

678
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,400
but you know four percent is not an

679
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
unreasonable figure for how much on

680
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
average

681
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,440
a bank is making in terms of interest

682
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
generally banks you know they might

683
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
charge one person 10 percent uh because

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
they think it's a really risky loan they

685
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
might charge a company that's really

686
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
stable only three percent it also

687
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
depends on what the central banks are

688
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
doing the interest rate but they care

689
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,159
about the spread and the spread will be

690
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
about four percent

691
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
so

692
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,320
back of the envelope calculations assume

693
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
that three percent was going to cover

694
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,720
you know salaries dividends big bonuses

695
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
at the end of the year nice parties and

696
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
so on well you've got one percent

697
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
to cover your losses

698
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
uh the industry figure is 0.75

699
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
okay so we have a critical system

700
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
system that our entire economy depends

701
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,960
on

702
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
a system that if it uh breaks in any

703
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,799
particular way will destroy an entire

704
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,080
society and has done on several

705
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
locations

706
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
and its fault tolerance is about 0.75

707
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,919
percent every year

708
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,200
great

709
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,720
would not pass design class

710
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,919
it wouldn't but you know it never got

711
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
designed it got emerged

712
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
um you know humans being humans doing

713
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,880
what we do best try it and see

714
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
so uh you can depending on the country

715
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,720
look at sort of some of the evidence

716
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
behind this

717
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
now

718
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
i'll talk about this again at the end of

719
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,679
the talk but

720
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
a continuing problem which you see with

721
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
a lot of economic figures is they don't

722
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,360
factor in any of this money supply

723
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
expansion stuff right so this is the

724
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,039
chart for how much net write-offs u.s

725
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,159
banks have done over the last 30 years

726
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
and when you're looking at it you have

727
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
to kind of squint and go okay

728
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
30 years ago the total money supply was

729
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,960
about a sixth what it is now

730
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
right

731
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
that's the money supply uh back you know

732
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
in sort of 1986 it's just past the two

733
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
trillion value

734
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,039
and so as a proportion a

735
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,640
two billion dollar write-off level is

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
actually a much higher percentage of the

737
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
total money supply back in the 1980s uh

738
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,039
than it will be the following uh decade

739
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
and especially uh now

740
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,440
but you can see that you know these uh

741
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
basically the the driving mechanism of a

742
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,559
recession

743
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,520
is these losses you know being very low

744
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
and then suddenly increasing above the

745
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
point that the banks can absorb them now

746
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,919
it depends a little bit on how bad the

747
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
situation is what your central bank will

748
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,120
do

749
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
in the 1980s what i've

750
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,559
saw somebody say at an economics

751
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
conference one time was basically

752
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
everybody knew everybody being the

753
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,919
central banks around the world that the

754
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
entire u.s system was insolvent i mean

755
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,000
it's a bit of an exaggeration but it was

756
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
kind of what was going on they'd made a

757
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,679
lot of loans to south america and the

758
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
south american government

759
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
defaulted on it and actually

760
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,200
government's defaulting on back loans is

761
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
historically been one of the big issues

762
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,279
with this system um because you know you

763
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,559
can't do anything about that when you're

764
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,840
banking you can you can beat up the

765
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
little guy but you know there's not a

766
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
lot you can do with charles ii

767
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
um

768
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,799
so uh basically everybody sort of

769
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,559
ignored that made whatever tolerances

770
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,159
they could and eventually the system got

771
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,840
to the point where it could drain out

772
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,320
the losses from the system and it was

773
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,520
pretty stable for the 1990s and then the

774
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
internet bubble happens

775
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
um and something else happens which is

776
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
called loan securitization i'll talk

777
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
about that in a moment and that causes a

778
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,240
huge wave of defaults in sort of the

779
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
2000s now

780
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
loan defaults are what we would call a

781
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
lagging indicator well that's what the

782
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,799
economist would call it i would call it

783
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,320
a latency problem

784
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,559
somebody defaults on the loan they stop

785
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,440
paying

786
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,279
their interest they probably stop paying

787
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,039
the capital as well the bank doesn't

788
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,440
just then and they write it off

789
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,039
in fact if the bank can't afford to

790
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,880
write it off without hitting its bank

791
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
capital it's going to keep that loan on

792
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,279
its books this is the so-called zombie

793
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,159
bank phenomena where a bank has a lot of

794
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,400
bad debt it's making a little bit of

795
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
money on the interest perhaps and it

796
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
can't make any new loans because the

797
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
rules won't let it

798
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
common in japan in the 1990s and also in

799
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,320
italy now

800
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,360
um so the banks will sort of bleed off

801
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
these excess periods and that's why you

802
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
see this sort of net write-off thing

803
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,080
actually lagging the main event of the

804
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,720
recession as well so in 2008 the credit

805
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
markets froze in 2008 but the write-offs

806
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
didn't really peak until a couple of

807
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,440
years later

808
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
so one of the problems in the entire

809
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,080
system is latency and various um

810
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,799
accompanies for that so

811
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
to understand what the central banks are

812
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,440
going to do in any given situation

813
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
um basically

814
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
they will act to protect the banking

815
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
system

816
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,799
and rule zero is money must not shrink

817
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
rule one is that debts must be repaid

818
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,880
because if they are not repaid the money

819
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,520
supply will shrink and rule two which is

820
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
what the politicians have told them is

821
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
inflation should be less than two

822
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
percent a year

823
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,679
only they don't really have any way to

824
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,440
do that but you know we'll we'll ignore

825
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,279
that problem for a moment

826
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
why must the money supply not shrink

827
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,200
well because the last time it shrunk in

828
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
a big way it destroyed the entire world

829
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
not exaggerating there you can draw a

830
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
straight line between the u.s banking

831
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,520
system essentially collapsing and the

832
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,080
money supply in the u.s shrinks by a

833
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
third in the great depression now you'll

834
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
still see economists saying no no it

835
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
didn't really it was the fed's fault

836
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
actually no it wasn't um when economists

837
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
say the money supply didn't shrink in

838
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,399
the great depression what they're

839
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,559
talking about is that asset money the

840
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,159
semaphore money the cash money that

841
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
actually does stay the same

842
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,480
it's the liability money that shrinks as

843
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
bank after bank in the great depression

844
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
went bankrupt and was just wiped out the

845
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,200
money supply progressively shrunk

846
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,760
well in a market-based economy prices

847
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,679
can adjust in that situation prices will

848
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
go down salaries will go down that is

849
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
painful but it is an adjustment

850
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
what doesn't adjust is the critical

851
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
thing what doesn't adjust is debt we

852
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,039
have no good way

853
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,320
to adjust

854
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
debt repayments especially from the

855
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,240
banking perspective because the banks

856
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
are stuck there right if they change the

857
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,320
value of the loan outstanding they've

858
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,480
also shrunk the money supply so they're

859
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,399
stuck with this and

860
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,279
so

861
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,159
as the 1930s progressed more and more

862
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,600
banks failed

863
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,120
more and more companies were unable to

864
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
repay their debts more and more banks

865
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
failed because of that and the entire

866
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,520
system basically reaches bottom in 1933

867
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,840
when roosevelt intervenes revalues the

868
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,320
value of gold and kind of kicks the

869
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
banking system off again it was probably

870
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,679
about to be

871
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,600
do it by itself anyway i mean the system

872
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,679
is somewhat resilient but the social

873
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,840
consequences are enormous

874
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
one of the social consequences was that

875
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,080
during the 1920s the new york banks had

876
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,320
made a lot of loans to germany to help

877
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,679
the germans recover the weimar

878
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,880
government then

879
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
and in 1929 they called them all back

880
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,960
because you can do that sometimes in the

881
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,039
system you just say repay me now all

882
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,919
right

883
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,279
of course they couldn't so the german

884
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,440
banks failed then there's a cascade

885
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,000
problem in germany hitler's performance

886
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,679
this uh the voting for hitler is

887
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,600
actually going down a little bit in 28

888
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,799
but by 1932 33

889
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,679
with the german economy collapsing again

890
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,600
the second time in 10 years essentially

891
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,640
um

892
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,559
right-wing progressivism seems like a

893
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,480
good choice

894
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,559
and the rest as they say is history

895
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,840
okay so

896
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
it's not a very stable system it's got

897
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
terrible fault tolerance just for the

898
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,799
record

899
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,640
is it possible to have a stable banking

900
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
system well

901
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
yes we can run a simulated stable

902
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
banking system under very peculiar

903
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
conditions which would never exist in

904
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,039
the real world

905
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
um

906
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,240
all account transfers have to occur

907
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,519
within the same bank that's an

908
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
interesting one

909
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,399
if there are unbalanced flows between

910
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,760
the banks

911
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,679
that creates what we call liquidity

912
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
problems you know one bank has doesn't

913
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,279
have enough asset cash to

914
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,200
pay their depositors and another bank

915
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,559
has too much

916
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
and actually loans will do this all by

917
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,640
themselves

918
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
i'll show you in a moment

919
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,120
loan defaults have to stay below the

920
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
magic profits and expenses uh thing or

921
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,240
that might be possible if bank was very

922
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
very conservative about its lending and

923
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,519
this tends to be how banks do behave

924
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,360
well run at once anyway

925
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
and it's also why banks have

926
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,279
progressively become far keener on

927
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,960
lending on property

928
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
which you know has a value as a

929
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
collateral that tends to retain itself

930
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,039
than for the original reason they were

931
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,399
set up which was lending to people to

932
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,000
create businesses which is also a

933
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,679
problem

934
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,039
and if you want to control the money

935
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,240
supply if you want to have a completely

936
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
stable money supply that is actually

937
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,559
possible you just have to have a strict

938
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,039
asset cash reserve requirement

939
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,880
uh and you have to apply it to all the

940
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
deposit liability accounts and not just

941
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
some of them and if you look at you know

942
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,240
the american banking system for example

943
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,039
it has a 10 reserve account requirement

944
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,039
but only on certain kinds of deposit

945
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,679
account so you know there's that

946
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,519
but it is possible and it can be done so

947
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,120
that raises another interesting question

948
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,480
should the money supply actually be

949
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,159
constant

950
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,679
it's a good question

951
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,720
um

952
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
economists and i actually kind of sort

953
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,799
of agree with them think not they think

954
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,880
that there's some value in having a low

955
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
rate of inflation not a high one that's

956
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,159
problematic we're about to find out how

957
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,600
problematic but

958
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
um a low one

959
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
kind of eases the invisible constraints

960
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,320
on people repaying their loans

961
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,919
collateral being perhaps a little worth

962
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,200
a little bit more every year so if

963
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
there's a loan default to the bank it's

964
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
not quite as serious

965
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
um

966
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
and it also means funnily enough that

967
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,279
there's actually more new lending

968
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
so if you look at the amount of new

969
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
lending you can have you know new loans

970
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
assuming you've got you've regulated the

971
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,080
system to not expand too fast can i ever

972
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
come from somebody repaying a loan so

973
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,519
the bank's got a little bit more lending

974
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,360
they can do to somebody else

975
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
or it can come from the expansion of the

976
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
monetary money supply and if you look at

977
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
the numbers actually

978
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,840
you know for especially short loans and

979
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
a reasonable monetary expansion rate the

980
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
us is about seven percent a year or at

981
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,799
least it was um you know

982
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,559
more new lending is going to come from

983
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,720
monetary expansion than it is from

984
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,799
people repaying their loans and if you

985
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,880
need new lending well that's something

986
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
to consider

987
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,840
why might you need new lending

988
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,039
well as i said there are a lot of

989
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,559
problems with banking some of them are

990
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,120
economic some of them are systemic one

991
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,679
of the economic problems is this

992
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
you know very small rates of default can

993
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,519
break the whole system

994
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,840
who's a big borrower from amongst other

995
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
people the banking system well in the

996
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,519
u.s power companies

997
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,360
power companies are building big power

998
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,039
plants and

999
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,960
these have to be financed over 30 or 40

1000
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
years so there's a lot of lending to the

1001
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,919
power industry

1002
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,240
the coal power industry and some of the

1003
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,879
nuclear power industry as well now

1004
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,119
it would be very sensible to switch all

1005
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,639
that lending and more over to uh natural

1006
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
forms of power generation silicon

1007
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
especially but also wave and so on and

1008
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
to do that now

1009
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,320
and i think people would except that you

1010
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,839
know it would crash the banking system

1011
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,520
it really would you know there's more

1012
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
than enough debt in those power

1013
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
companies to take out the finance the

1014
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,399
banking system um in a big way

1015
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,679
and

1016
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,119
the interesting part is that might just

1017
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
happen anyway i mean the improvements in

1018
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
uh solar cells

1019
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
are accelerating at such a rate that

1020
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
this might just happen you know without

1021
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,599
anybody

1022
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
you know trying to get involved or try

1023
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,800
to stop it i hope they don't try to stop

1024
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
it but you know

1025
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,159
so there is this element too to banking

1026
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,839
that sometimes the banking system goes

1027
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,000
wrong the regulations fail or something

1028
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
bad happens and sometimes the economy

1029
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
goes wrong you know something happens in

1030
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,200
the economy like you know

1031
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
solar cells or in the 1920s it was

1032
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
basically the invention of the combine

1033
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,520
harvester

1034
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,400
speeds up that part of the economy it

1035
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,640
doesn't necessarily need lending anymore

1036
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
and the whole system gets out of whack

1037
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,480
again so you know we don't know really

1038
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
enough about that side of things but

1039
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,599
it's definitely a factor there in

1040
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
history

1041
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
and we see this a bit in the great

1042
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,839
recession in 2008

1043
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,640
um what caused the

1044
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,400
previous crash because we're now into

1045
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
another one

1046
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,599
so

1047
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,200
another element of the history of the

1048
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
system the long one i could give a whole

1049
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
lecture on this is how do we control it

1050
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,240
and

1051
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
first people try to control the

1052
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
expansion rate to stop you know the

1053
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,400
money supply expanding too much this was

1054
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,560
done naturally by depending on the price

1055
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,680
of gold um which it works up to a point

1056
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
but actually every time somebody writes

1057
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
a check and uses that virtual money on

1058
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,880
the right-hand side uh they influence

1059
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
the price of gold without the sort of

1060
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
gold itself being involved and so if you

1061
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,079
look at the figures for the gold

1062
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,680
standards they've sort of been two

1063
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
periods when we use gold that way you

1064
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
actually see a slow steady expansion in

1065
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,440
the money supply even in this period

1066
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
where a lot of people would have you

1067
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
believe that it's stable it wasn't but

1068
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,079
it wasn't expanding that fast so it kind

1069
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,839
of worked for a while

1070
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,280
um

1071
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,040
after the collapse of the second gold

1072
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,560
standard which was the bretton woods

1073
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,880
fixed currency exchange scheme

1074
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
and fundamentally it collapses because

1075
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,800
everybody's buying oil from arabia huge

1076
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
amounts of money are piling up there

1077
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
there isn't a good way for it to come

1078
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,800
back

1079
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,720
all the banking systems are sort of

1080
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
expanding at different rates

1081
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
and eventually it became possible to

1082
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,400
arbitrage the price of gold between

1083
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,880
london and the us and that lasted for

1084
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
about three days before nixon was told

1085
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,560
to pull the us out of the bretton woods

1086
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,839
scheme

1087
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,680
for the next 10 years the system kind of

1088
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,200
freewheels which causes a lot of

1089
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,760
countries immense problems and iceland

1090
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
in particular has a hyper inflation

1091
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,599
because of that

1092
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,520
and then the basel capital controls

1093
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,240
emerge in the 1980s and basil capital

1094
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,480
effectively shifts regulation from the

1095
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,760
reserve requirement on the left to the

1096
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
uh capital

1097
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,119
uh on the right and capital is a few

1098
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,160
things

1099
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
unfortunately one of the things capital

1100
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
can be is some forms of debt but mostly

1101
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,720
it's things like loss provisions and the

1102
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,040
initial injection of cash that allows

1103
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,000
the bank to be a bank in the first place

1104
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
so okay that's fine it actually works

1105
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
quite well as a regulatory framework

1106
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,160
problem was

1107
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
way back in the 1930s and said it's a

1108
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
very slow system so sometimes the causes

1109
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
of problems are really removed from the

1110
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
sort of final denominator as it were um

1111
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
the us is a great depression measure

1112
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,280
brought in something called loan

1113
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
securitization

1114
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,520
loan securitization is basically allows

1115
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
a bank to take a loan that is made

1116
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,640
create some money with and just sell it

1117
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,560
to somebody else i mean it's a decent

1118
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,320
investment alone you know a treasury is

1119
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
alone so

1120
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
fannie and freddie mae did this for

1121
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,240
decades at a very slow level it didn't

1122
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,920
do anything particularly bad it probably

1123
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,599
helped the economy it slightly increased

1124
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,680
the total amount of debt available

1125
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,320
and then computerization comes in in the

1126
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,480
1980s and 1990s and it suddenly becomes

1127
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
possible to do it on large scale

1128
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,800
and salmon brothers is actually the sort

1129
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
of company that kicks this off

1130
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,200
and suddenly there is a lot more debt in

1131
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
the system because up till that point

1132
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,160
with traditional fractional reserve

1133
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,520
banking

1134
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,920
without it really being explicit there

1135
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
was always this one-to-one relationship

1136
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
between the amount of debt and the

1137
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,839
amount of money

1138
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,599
and loan securitization broke that

1139
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,560
completely and suddenly you had a lot

1140
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
more lending and you know a certain

1141
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,400
amount of money

1142
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,560
think of it as a water system okay

1143
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
you've got pipes the pipes are loans

1144
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
money's flowing around them you increase

1145
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,960
the total number of pipes but you leave

1146
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
the amount of water alone that's what

1147
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
loan securitization is and suddenly the

1148
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
pressure starts going down and at some

1149
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,599
point in the system there isn't any

1150
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,280
water flowing at all

1151
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,520
and that's where the loan defaults start

1152
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,720
and basically that was the 2008 crash it

1153
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,078
takes a while to build up

1154
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,599
because fundamentally debt is an

1155
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,839
asymmetric network flow

1156
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,000
by asymmetric we mean that more is going

1157
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,920
in one way than another and this is

1158
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,680
where you know i came in as a network

1159
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
engineer and goes okay that's

1160
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
interesting because you know in computer

1161
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
networks when we have that going on it

1162
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,079
usually causes quite a lot of problems

1163
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,240
and it does in banking networks as well

1164
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,599
um

1165
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
the loan securitization broke some sort

1166
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,440
of things that the banks were doing

1167
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
without even really you know telling

1168
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,160
anyone

1169
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,079
one of the things banks do is try to

1170
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
keep all these money flows on their

1171
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,599
books they would rather there wasn't any

1172
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,760
interbank you know flows you know they

1173
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,480
want their lenders to basically

1174
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,200
um be basically perhaps working for a

1175
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
company that's also borrowing from them

1176
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
and so all of this money just stays on

1177
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
the right hand side

1178
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
no cash involved everybody's happy all

1179
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,960
right

1180
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,480
and they will make decisions accordingly

1181
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
so quite often you'll be told you know

1182
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,320
if you want to borrow from a bank you

1183
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,599
need to have your account you need to

1184
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
have your salary paid into us and that's

1185
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,359
that's why

1186
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,720
okay

1187
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,800
loan securitization just let them sell

1188
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
these loans willy-nilly across the

1189
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,040
system so set up all these cross-bank

1190
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,960
flows and

1191
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
after a while you know what happens

1192
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,079
basically if you know you've got your

1193
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,040
borrower here and they take their loan

1194
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
over to some other bank well they're

1195
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,480
paying back more than you originally

1196
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,520
gave them

1197
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,640
and

1198
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,680
bank three starts losing its cash

1199
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
you know without bank free of any

1200
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,560
control over this

1201
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,319
bank three is seeing a continuous flow

1202
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,160
of money bank back to bank two basically

1203
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
the interest rate

1204
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,520
uh this is one of the ways that interest

1205
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
rates affect the banking system which is

1206
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
not acknowledged um

1207
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,359
the higher the banking s the the higher

1208
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,480
the interest rate the faster that

1209
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,400
process will naturally be

1210
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,079
um so it could be about to get

1211
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,240
interesting

1212
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,960
and what you also saw in this period and

1213
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,200
this may not be that visible i apologize

1214
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,599
um banks started taking loans from other

1215
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,280
people so they would also borrow and

1216
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,720
re-lend

1217
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,200
and that doesn't make the banking system

1218
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
any stabler

1219
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,400
so uh cut a long story short

1220
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,240
the united states printed a whole bunch

1221
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,200
of money

1222
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,960
used it to buy the bad debt on the

1223
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,160
banking books put it aside kept it away

1224
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,319
and actually did manage to more or less

1225
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
recover the system uh

1226
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,319
so and this is we're showing we're

1227
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,440
showing here is m0 and m0 is the asset

1228
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,960
the physical cache that we keep talking

1229
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,960
about m2 is the deposit account and you

1230
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,119
know you can see this jumping up and

1231
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,880
down like a yoyo

1232
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,480
but the m2 up until reload do recently

1233
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
was pretty stable expanding but stable

1234
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
so what happens in 2020 why do we

1235
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
currently have inflation what aren't the

1236
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,720
central banks

1237
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,240
really wanting to admit in public

1238
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,520
although if you read the right articles

1239
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,550
in the financial times they do admit it

1240
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,319
[Music]

1241
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,960
in 2020 with the entire world basically

1242
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
going let's shut down the economy which

1243
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
is not something that's ever been

1244
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,960
designed to do um

1245
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
essentially it was obvious to everybody

1246
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,480
that within a month or two the entire

1247
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,760
banking system would collapse because

1248
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,599
nobody had any salaries to pay their

1249
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,480
debt

1250
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
so without anyone you know even almost

1251
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,400
discussing it the

1252
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,720
uh american bank basically printed two

1253
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,160
trillion dollars and handed out to

1254
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,119
everybody

1255
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,160
and unlike um the great recession you

1256
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,240
know the previous time

1257
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,880
when you give money to everybody in the

1258
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,720
system the way they did that's a direct

1259
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,319
injection into the banking system and

1260
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,000
the banking system then starts to expand

1261
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,040
that quite quickly even under credit uh

1262
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,359
capital reserves and you can see here

1263
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,359
that you know whereas it was a sort of

1264
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,440
two times a decade system

1265
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,280
now it's expanding a bit faster and the

1266
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,359
second expansion isn't really the

1267
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,040
government so much this is the banking

1268
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,640
system getting going and making more

1269
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,040
lending and more money

1270
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,359
so that is today's problem now whether

1271
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,280
it's stabilizing or whether it's going

1272
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,119
to continue expanding i don't know the

1273
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,440
eu looks the same most countries are

1274
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,280
starting to look the same we are

1275
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,720
probably looking at a period of you know

1276
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,319
increased inflation

1277
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,800
and increasing interest rates probably

1278
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,119
isn't going to help that much with that

1279
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,720
to actually stop this you need to

1280
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,359
intervene with the lending itself and

1281
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,359
sort of tell the banks okay you need to

1282
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,599
basically be i would just put rules on i

1283
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,760
would i would say okay you can lend to

1284
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
new forms of energy you can lend to

1285
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,880
somebody who's never bought a house

1286
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,960
before that person over there who wants

1287
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,040
to refinance their home and buy a

1288
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,200
mercedes or something well tough luck

1289
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
but you know that's just me

1290
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,720
all right

1291
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,640
that was the crash course on banking i

1292
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,140
probably confused everyone

1293
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:50,160
[Applause]

1294
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,839
how can we get involved with this

1295
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,040
because

1296
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,520
i can tell you now

1297
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
economists

1298
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,720
honestly i'll skip through all this

1299
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,560
sorry if you want to see it it's uh it's

1300
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,759
interesting but we're out of time

1301
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,119
economic models and they have them are

1302
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,079
terrible i mean it's beyond uh

1303
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,160
pre-copernican um

1304
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
we are talking you know the best way to

1305
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,760
describe existing economic models is

1306
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,280
they are trying to fit a very short

1307
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,480
ruler to a very long curve and it's even

1308
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,760
worse than that because there's a whole

1309
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
sort of set of papers basically called

1310
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,760
calibration

1311
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,680
which is you know how to get your model

1312
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,280
to you know fit the data that you're

1313
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,160
getting

1314
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,599
and yeah if you take a short ruler and

1315
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,040
you've got a system that's sort of doing

1316
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,280
this you can fit it it's actually more

1317
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
doing this to be honest but anyway um

1318
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
you can get it to fit the data for a

1319
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,119
certain amount of time and then you know

1320
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,800
it stops

1321
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,240
they're not going to get out of this on

1322
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,839
their own they really aren't they're

1323
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,880
trapped in basically textbooks that are

1324
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
presenting them with false falsehoods

1325
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,720
about how the whole system works

1326
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,680
a very complicated system and no tools

1327
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,359
to analyze it properly

1328
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,160
so

1329
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,079
i feel quite strongly that we sort of as

1330
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,599
computer scientists as network

1331
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,960
specialists as programmers and it is

1332
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,319
quite fun actually to build economic

1333
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,880
simulations and crash the banking system

1334
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,640
um need to basically provide them with

1335
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,000
tools and there's a huge amount of work

1336
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,520
to be done and if you want to be sort of

1337
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,040
you know talk to me about how perhaps we

1338
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,720
start organizing this please catch me

1339
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,359
after the talk

1340
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,880
by all means play with fred needle if

1341
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,400
you want if it doesn't work for you call

1342
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,680
me i'll

1343
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
get you up and started

1344
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,079
it is free for non-commercial use and if

1345
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,119
you want to do something commercial

1346
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,839
we'll figure out some

1347
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,079
way other than that um

1348
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
one thing we could all do

1349
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
and i would advise you to do it just

1350
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,640
personally

1351
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,000
figure out for the country you're living

1352
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,839
in what your monetary expansion rate is

1353
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,440
is it two times is it three times four

1354
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
times whatever

1355
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,200
and then start a movement to correct all

1356
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,319
financial numbers for expansion in m3

1357
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,160
and especially government debt because

1358
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,720
there's this constant thing of oh my god

1359
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,480
the right-wing people say the government

1360
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,640
is spending more and more and it is

1361
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,920
because there's more and more money in

1362
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,359
the system every year and so they get

1363
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,880
more and more tax income because of that

1364
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,160
they're fairly hooked into the whole

1365
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
cycle and yes they're spending more but

1366
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
prices are going up and you know if you

1367
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,240
actually look for example at how much

1368
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,599
the us government

1369
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,359
is receiving as a percentage of the

1370
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,839
total money supply it's getting smaller

1371
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,839
every year

1372
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
and i could give a separate talk on why

1373
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
that is and it's essentially because

1374
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,960
money is piling up in the financial

1375
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,880
system and can't escape into the other

1376
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,079
system so we get more and more rich

1377
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,000
people well actually we get fewer and

1378
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,240
fewer but they're more rich

1379
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,119
and

1380
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,079
you know

1381
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,599
the government's getting actually less

1382
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,280
money to spend every year as proportion

1383
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,800
of the total money supply and nobody's

1384
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
really sort of thinking things through

1385
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,599
in that level

1386
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,920
there is a fair amount of correction of

1387
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,319
you know they will correct for inflation

1388
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,680
well that's fine

1389
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,359
but you know

1390
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,880
the figure of inflation is we're

1391
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,319
producing more and more every year as

1392
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,920
well so it's a bit of a misleading

1393
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,520
statistic

1394
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,280
it's a function of both the amount of

1395
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,000
stuff and the money supply so i think

1396
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,520
just correcting by the money supply is

1397
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,800
the way to go

1398
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,079
um

1399
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,319
or were they correct by gdp and yes

1400
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,640
that's another slew of problems so

1401
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,400
at any rate if you would like to be

1402
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,599
involved in a sort of open source

1403
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,680
movement to try to develop economic

1404
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,960
models that are actually based on real

1405
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,920
economies and not fantasies

1406
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,280
get me after the

1407
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,560
talk thank you very much for listening

1408
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,680
if anybody has questions please move to

1409
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
the mic one question per person few

1410
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,160
minutes left um what so what are

1411
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,359
generally the differences between

1412
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,200
threadneedle and this minsky software

1413
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,799
that steve keane talks about a lot

1414
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,079
the basic difference is i use double

1415
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,720
entry bookkeeping

1416
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,559
there are several models minsky is one

1417
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,400
of them that are based on sort of the

1418
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
balance sheet view

1419
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
and that's the level above

1420
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
and that would be great and i think it

1421
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,599
would work well it does actually it's

1422
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
better than just anything else the

1423
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,079
problem is that there are some things

1424
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,319
that can quite important things that can

1425
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,000
be different at the double entry

1426
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
bookkeeping level but the same at the

1427
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,760
accounting level and we ran into this in

1428
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
iceland funnily enough um

1429
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,480
negatively amortized loans which is a

1430
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,319
form of loan where the capital grows

1431
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,800
rather than shrinks

1432
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,319
the double entry bookkeeping there

1433
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,680
really matters in terms of how the

1434
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
system behaves and yet the accounting

1435
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,079
view simply doesn't catch it

1436
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,280
double entry bookkeeping is

1437
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,880
uncontrovertible it's a protocol it's

1438
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,200
just like tcpip we can audit it we can

1439
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
be sure of it it's the atomic level of

1440
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,559
banking system i would strongly

1441
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,160
recommend we go with that

1442
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
but yeah that's between me and keen i

1443
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
guess

1444
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
hey

1445
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,839
i get the impression that most of the

1446
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,839
problems you discussed here are entirely

1447
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,680
a function of the fractional reserve

1448
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,040
system where

1449
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,520
banks loan money they don't actually

1450
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,920
have and that if you would require them

1451
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,240
to only loan when did they actually have

1452
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,559
most most of it would go away is that

1453
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,040
true and if so why is this system

1454
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,520
necessary well um

1455
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,960
it's a good very good question about the

1456
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
necessity um you would get a different

1457
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,119
set of problems is the evidence we have

1458
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,559
from simulation

1459
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,720
why is the system necessary well it's

1460
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,559
really really hard and the crypto people

1461
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,119
have been discovering this to scale to

1462
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,400
the planet

1463
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,240
right to have a monetary transfer system

1464
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,319
that allows you to go into you know from

1465
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,079
iceland and go into an atm in tokyo and

1466
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,200
take up money is no small achievement

1467
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,520
and the system you've just described

1468
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,000
probably wouldn't be able to do that

1469
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
um and i'll you know it's hard to prove

1470
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,280
these sort of things but i will point

1471
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,359
out that crypto essentially reinvented

1472
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,440
fractional reserve banking

1473
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,960
right they did you look at teva for

1474
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,760
example it's got loans on the asset side

1475
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,680
um and they did this very very quickly

1476
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,119
so it's actually an interesting question

1477
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,720
is can you stop people reinventing

1478
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,640
fractional reserve banking right because

1479
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,240
it's statistical multiplexing and

1480
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,839
actually most networks when you get into

1481
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,240
them you know your isp it basically

1482
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,640
takes a 10 gigabit per second line and

1483
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,640
it sells it to 100 people one gigabit

1484
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,720
per second each that is a form of

1485
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,079
fraction reserve banking or statistical

1486
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,160
multiplexing it works until everybody

1487
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,359
wants to stream the same thing at the

1488
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,839
same

1489
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,040
time so if you can design a network

1490
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
system that scales that meets fishing

1491
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,200
consensus problems and that separates

1492
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,040
completely money and banking i think

1493
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,119
everybody would be a lot happier but

1494
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,400
until we can do that we're stuck with it

1495
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,559
cryptocurrencies exist and assume that

1496
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,200
bitcoin can scale to b money which you

1497
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,960
currently can't but assume that it gets

1498
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,200
there what effect does that have on the

1499
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,040
existing banking system

1500
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,520
um i think that would probably replace

1501
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,839
the banking system but let me point out

1502
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,119
um

1503
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,480
and i've published a paper on this

1504
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,599
although i couldn't get into a journal

1505
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,960
because they wanted me to solve the

1506
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,040
problem it is provably impossible for

1507
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,960
bitcoin to scale to

1508
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,760
that kind of level it's based on a full

1509
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,319
mesh network and the scaling properties

1510
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,559
of a formation network are order n

1511
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,280
brackets n minus one number of nodes

1512
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,960
you can't scale bitcoin to anything

1513
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,359
close to what would be required and

1514
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,720
that's why people have reinvented

1515
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,000
fractional reserve banking with it you

1516
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,559
know it at some level it's a really

1517
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,079
elegant solution

1518
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,280
and then you look at all the problems

1519
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,960
that come with it and you go oh my god

1520
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,920
uh on a scale of one to ten how badly

1521
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,720
our solar panel leasing companies gonna

1522
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,640
screw us over

1523
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,119
i have no idea um

1524
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,640
honestly i'm sorry i don't know anything

1525
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,680
about that

1526
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,800
um

1527
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,400
but it's gonna screw us over a lot more

1528
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,760
if we don't do something about global

1529
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,760
warming

1530
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,960
all right

1531
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,579
