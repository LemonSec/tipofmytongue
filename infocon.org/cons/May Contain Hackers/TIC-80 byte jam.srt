1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,600
so welcome everyone uh it's very nice to

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,820
see that so many people show up now

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,439
tonight

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,720
um I'm not in the real deal machine I'm

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,340
interested in new machines and it's kind

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,980
of new for me also and one of the first

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,500
things I saw was uh this kind of event

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,440
and it's called a live coding and I can

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,680
bike gem and by GEM is a friendly get

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,980
together and just make some nice coats

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,739
and see what's uh what's going to happen

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,960
so with this pretense please give a big

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,239
round of applause for tick 80 bite damn

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,019
yeah

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,480
now I'm gonna give the world to honestly

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,640
because he's better with take 80 and

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,379
stuff so here you go

19
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,260
well I'm also not a real demo sooner

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,180
even though I have participated a couple

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,680
of times and

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,220
mostly lost but sometimes one in this

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,560
case I'm a scene consumer but I do know

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,960
a tiny bit of tech 18 so I can try and

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
explain what the coders are doing

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,600
[Music]

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,159
so

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,140
let's see is everybody ready is the

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,180
referee ready no

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,920
the referee is not yet ready

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,200
[Music]

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,880
what are you seeing

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,259
[Music]

34
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,470
oh

35
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,799
[Music]

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,399
so for people new to the tech 80 the

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,040
tech 80 is a fantasy console a fantasy

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,640
console is not a proper real console

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,159
that you might know like a Commodore 64

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
and MSX a Nas a Sega Dreamcast whatever

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,600
those are real consoles a fantasy

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,939
console is a New Concept made

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,280
specifically for time constraint coding

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,160
and bite size constraint coding the

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,780
whole idea is that you take a modern CPU

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,840
and still apply some limits to it

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,300
because demo scene started becoming

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,180
boring everybody can make nice awesome

49
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,640
stuff with all the power of a modern

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,819
computer so it was decided to make

51
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,640
fantasy consoles someone decided I don't

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,879
know who the tick 80 is one of the more

53
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,860
modern fantasy consoles and it has the

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,739
option of coding in Lua in JavaScript

55
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,099
scripts in many other languages

56
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,340
but in this case I guess they're all

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,879
going to be coding in Lua

58
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
and you have a tiny screen resolution I

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,220
forgot the screen size

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,360
anybody knows

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,340
[Music]

62
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,940
nope

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,099
240 by

64
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,200
by

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,260
136 pixels so that's a tiny resolution

66
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,800
you have a small bit of memory which I

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
also forgot how much

68
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,019
it's complicated okay let's keep it at

69
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,200
that

70
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,080
and the whole idea is that

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,360
[Music]

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
um

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,799
people get a time limit in this case 40

74
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
minutes and also a size limit normally

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,599
that's calculated in bytes

76
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,299
265 bytes 128 bytes this time we're

77
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,640
going for

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
64k

79
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,860
so that's a lot of typing in 40 minutes

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,640
yeah

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,860
I don't think anybody's Gonna Fill the

82
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,140
size limit

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,099
um

84
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,920
let's see we're still waiting for the

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
networking stuff to be set up correctly

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,180
super Rogue is doing an awesome job

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,160
there

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,659
[Music]

89
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,510
and blinner is doing some hat bobbing

90
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:22,520
[Music]

91
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,199
luckily we have a good DJ

92
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,930
IO

93
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,340
[Music]

94
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,320
would be interesting if we had people

95
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,699
here on the field that know something

96
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,100
about computers they might be able to

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,370
help

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,379
[Music]

99
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,840
you got it you have the green lights

100
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,989
[Music]

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,520

[Music]

103
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,000
yes we have some people on the screen

[Music]

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,759
so as you can see uh

106
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,699
glenry is on the

107
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,560
left side while sitting on the right

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,680
side Lynn is on the right side sitting

109
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,940
on the left side

110
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,360
I think we are almost ready Let's have a

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
look at the referee

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
are we ready

113
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,650
almost

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:52,100
[Music]

115
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,460
so the DJ can start whenever he wants

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,230
oh

117
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:19,069

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,800
thank you

125
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,139
[Music]

126
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,759
yeah ready

127
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,979
Get Set Let's Go

128
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,080
there is no subject this time so it's

129
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
all creativity

130
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,220
as you might be able to see it says

131
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,199
function tick

132
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,560
and that is the main function of a tick

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,120
80. every clock every screen refresh so

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,599
60 times or 50 times a second this

135
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,940
function gets called and whatever is in

136
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,180
there will be

137
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,660
shown on the screen

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,960
and if we look at blenry's screen on the

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,300
left we see that he is making some

140
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,880
shortcuts instead of maths in

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,300
ETC it's just sin caused by square root

142
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,759
all that kind of stuff makes it a lot

143
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,340
easier and less time consuming to type

144
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,819
and also in case of a size constraint oh

145
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,720
we're at 509 bytes apparently

146
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,259
um in case of a size constraint version

147
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,500
this actually does matter

148
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,020
[Music]

149
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,198

[Music]

151
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,139
is going to be drawing some lines

152
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,259
and blendry is going to be drawing some

153
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,979
triangles

154
00:08:34,919 --> 00:09:02,179
[Music]

155
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
am I gonna be controversial when I'm

156
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,800
saying there's a Camelot

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,830
steps that Lynn is drawing

158
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,420
[Music]

159
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,750
[Laughter]

160
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,880
I'm terrible with names even names of

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
effects so you can tell me anything it

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,920
is

163
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:41,279
[Music]

164
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,800
if this relaxing life coding is making

165
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,740
you want to join in

166
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,980
you should visit demozoo.org

167
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,019
it has a nice list of upcoming

168
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,240
competitions

169
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,960
that are going to be a lot more frantic

170
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:07,160
[Music]

171
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,140
I think blenary is making a camp field

172
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,320
with trees or something

173
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,670

Lua is a very easy language to get into

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,260
it also has a lot of stupid quirks

I'm unfortunately all out of Lua rulers

pellet in the tick 80 has the colors in

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,120
a sane order

380
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,550

flowing rainbows there

402
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,519
that's starting to look really nice

403
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,700
and it also looks like iOS getting ready

404
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,260
to get some music going again

405
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,840

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,099
well since IO is teasing me I'll tell

424
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,079
these Souls what's up

425
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,740
the demo scene was first started in the

426
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,240
early 80s in the cracker scene because

427
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,339
all those cracked software you have to

428
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,040
present your cracker group and make some

429
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,260
advertisement for yourself

430
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,839
and how best to do that by showing your

431
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,540
coding skills your graphic skills your

432
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,339
music skills

433
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:30,240
and those intros well

434
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
at some point in time turn out into

435
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,800
Bigger Productions

436
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,640
full demos multi-disc demos

437
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,920
and with the passing of time and

438
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,200
different platforms

439
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,020
there came the PC with tons of

440
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,300
graphics cards and everything became

441
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,900
boring

442
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,460
luckily fantasy consoles were invented

443
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,540
to make it less boring by adding

444
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,660
new constraints because constraints

445
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,810
breed creativity

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,420

459

460
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,000

468
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,180
instead of the

469
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,900
40 minutes that we are now using usually

470
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,380
it's 15 minutes so can you imagine this

471

thank you

527
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,000

528
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,240
photorealistic 8-bit MCH 2021 postcards

533
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,859
ing If This Were a size constraint

534
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,260
competition people would be stressing

535
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,640
out because the dark bar below is red

536
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,819
which means they're way oversized

537
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,099
unfortunately well fortunately both are

538
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,720
almost 1K

539
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,300
which is a nice

540
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,099
Target to aim for probably

541
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:43,980
perfect score

542
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,339
[Music]

543
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:51,599
what would be the perfect score well

544
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,220
that completely depends on the

545
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,560
competition in this case the perfect

546
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,380
score is whatever we think is the

547
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,420
Perfect Score so probably one three

548
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,060
three seven or something

549
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,800
um in normal size constraint

550
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,460
competitions it's usually 265 bytes

551
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,800
um 56 256 bites

552
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,200

what is also bad is not bringing back

drop off the headphones before leaving

even these monitor speakers will be

coders start your fingers

683
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,480
this time we are not swapped so it's

guest man that's actually on the right

685
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,559
and he wants a theme so whoever walks up

686
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,480
to the microphone first

687
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,319

the A10 somebody can explain it better

755
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:47,339
than me because it's a tangent thingy

which is when you take a sign and a

cosine and do some tangenty things

hundreds upon hundreds of demo parties

01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:15,060
every year some are dedicated to a

843
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:19,620
single platform for example in March

844
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,020
I've recall correctly next year there

845
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:26,159
will be X 2023 which is a Commodore 64

846
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,300
only party so only people 40 plus are

847
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,719
allowed

848
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,370
sorry Lynn

[Laughter]

850
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,520
there are some Amiga oriented parties

851
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,060
for example I forgot

852
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,940
um Atari oriented parties like outline

853
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,219
where nobody gives a that's Atari

854
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,500
oriented and just puts in demos on any

855
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,540
platform imaginable

856
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:59,580
there are big events like evoke

857
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,620
um

858
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,199
revision that even has a satellite party

859
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,699
on a mountain

860
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:09,300
that is boozembly where there's just

861
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,500
alcohol being drank and Happy Hardcore

862
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,320
techno music being played on

863
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,460
technically completely Amiga mod

864
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:25,620
there's Nova and the where is Nova

865
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,719
Nova in the UK

866
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,120
so there you can only use BS something

867
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,120
something plugs for your computer which

868
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,060
is completely impractical in a European

869
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,820
Union where everybody uses shuko

870
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,340
but other than that luckily they do have

871
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:45,480
230 volts or plus minus some volts

872
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:50,340
50 hertz so that's pretty much okay

873
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,560

874
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,500

[Music]

881
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,780
and over the years I've seen that most

882
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,420
of the fun demo entries are actually in

883
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,020
size constraint competitions first there

884
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:37,679
was the 64k 4K but nowadays 1K up to and

885
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,420
I don't want to distract super Rogue

886
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,260
while it's doing some very hardcore moth

887
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,900
what is the smallest competition we have

888
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,400
at lovebite

889
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,140
this is 60 bucks

890
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,960
16 bite competitions so literally 16

891
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,000
characters and 8 byte showcases so I

892
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,320
mean my name is longer than 16 bytes

893
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,659
my birth date is longer than 8 bytes

01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,060
and yes you can demo it's gonna say in

01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,500
here I forgot to mention field effects

896
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,480
which is the demo party that happens at

897
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,280
EMF camp

898
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,260

899
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,360
if anybody has shout outs for more

900
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,699

901
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,960
or any other interruptions of any kind

902
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,780
we are also past the halfway mark of

905
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,040

super Rogue has a wobbly eyed unicorn

908
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,020
it's only wobbly eyed because of the

they are expensive and we want to do

screen you give it a color

928
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,280
and that gives you a nice background

929
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,960
color for example

930
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,719

you might notice that demo scene is like

naming variables in terrible ways that's

986
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,940
mostly because of size constraint coding

1012
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,540
well the art tangent basically

1013
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:31,199
calculates the angle between the X and Y

1014
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:35,880
so give it X and Y and it makes the or

1015
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,440
it calculates the training of the uh

1016
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,060
angle of the triangle

1017
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:45,080
so the straight parts of a

1018
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:49,560
H 90 degree triangle thank you so

1019
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,659
basically you can usually get the

1020
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:55,199
direction if you know two points

1021
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,920
that is very handy yes that's also all I

1022
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,080
do with architecture for the rest

1023
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,900
probably all the useful things but I

1024
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,739
just see it as X and Y two degrees or

1025
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:10,679
gradients thank you that is very helpful

1026
