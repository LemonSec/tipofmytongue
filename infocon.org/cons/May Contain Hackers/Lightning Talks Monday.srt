[Music]

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,920
is there anything else

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
i don't think so so it's time for me to

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
introduce our speaker who is going to

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,039
present on a subject that i really need

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
when i'm studying french vocabulary

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,799
because it's amazing give a big applause

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,360
thanks for the intro

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
um all right everything seems to be

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,239
mostly in order except the i have slides

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,640
can i get

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,280
slides i i see them on the monitor but

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
not on there yet

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
can you see can you see slides

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,239
okay okay yeah it's just like the talk

16
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,520
name right now uh okay so

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,399
uh

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
i'm going to talk about anki which you

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
some of you might know it's a program

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,760
which i use for

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,320
remembering all sorts of things and i

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
found it really useful for like geeking

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
out about

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
about like like making the spec spectrum

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
of things that i'm interested in geeking

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
out about much bigger so like uh

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,680
uh here's a couple of things which i can

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
do with anki which i found useful

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,759
so um

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
i went back like i went back to my

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
university uh education and i like went

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,079
through a couple of these first year

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,560
lessons where you learn like oh like 50

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
crms about an analytical geometry or

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,200
something or uh

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
or let's say mathematical analysis and

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,119
now i can like remember the proofs for

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
them uh like i'm never going to again

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
forget miley micron

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
or you can remember oh one one eight

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
nine nine nine eight eight one nine nine

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,439
uh

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,170
one one nine seven two five three

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,640
[Music]

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,600
nine one

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
whatever um yeah you can i can like

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
resize my eye band from memory you can

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
use it to memorize the nato phonetic

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
alphabet uh when i went to switzerland i

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
used this to learn german from basically

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
knowing nothing to being at like b1 b2

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
level in about a year

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
um i use this to memorize people's names

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
so if i have a picture of you somewhere

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
online i basically assume that i have

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,680
permission to put it into my anki and to

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
like use that to remember your face and

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
your name i use it to remember keyboard

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
shortcuts remember like when i read the

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
paper i use it to remember what the

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
paper was about what were the basic

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
methods um

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,840
like other random things like i'm not at

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
all like a science person

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
or like medical science person but like

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
i usually to memorize like a bit about

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
the human body like the names of like

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
major brain regions

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
so how anki works

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
so anki and space deposition in general

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
works based on a thing called the

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
spacing effect

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
uh basically the spacing effect

74
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,480
is

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
has been studied since the like

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,879
beginning of the

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,519
19th no 20th century

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
uh and it it's an effect where uh if you

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
if you have one hour of uh time that

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
you're willing to invest into learning

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
something

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,000
then the thing that you absolutely do

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
not want to do is spend that spend one

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
whole hour at in one chunk learning the

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
thing because then like you're going to

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
put a lot of information into your head

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,159
and then you're going to forget it in

88
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,280
two hours

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,640
uh so

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
uh turns out that

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,360
uh it's much better if you spend say

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
like five minutes studying it at first

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
then like you come back an hour later

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
and you again study it for five minutes

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
then you come again like two hours later

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,640
then you come a day later and so on

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
so that means that you can like invest

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
this time into learning much more

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,599
efficiently and the reason this works

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,400
is that uh every time you're remembering

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
the thing again after a certain time has

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
passed since you last recalled it you

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
have to think a little bit to remember

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,319
it because like you don't have it

105
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
immediately in your mind and what you're

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,760
doing there is like you know thinking

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
for like maybe five ten seconds what is

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,799
the thing

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,599
and then you're doing uh active recall

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
and active recall is the thing which

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
reinforces memories which makes things

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
go from shorter memory to longer term

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
memory

114
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,759
uh so space repetition is a the is an

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,120
algorithm

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
like in a very simple sense which uses

117
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
this spacing effect to let you learn

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
things fast and uh

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
the thing that you do is like super

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
simple you just uh try to do something

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
that some kind of skill or recalling

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
something that you that you're trying to

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
learn

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
and

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
you just see that you did it correctly

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
and if you did it correctly you wait a

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
bit longer until you try it again

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,680
if you didn't do it correctly you do it

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
again after a shorter interval

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
basically like it's typically it's done

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,240
like exponentially so like next interval

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
either like is multiplied by a constant

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,640
or divided by a constant

134
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,039
[Music]

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,560
so anki is a open source tool uh which

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,039
is used to to make these flashcards

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
so a flashcard is a thing where you

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
uh you you have kind of a question

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
which for in this case is like try to

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
remember what is the integral of the

141
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,199
logarithm of t

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
dt and uh then you try to remember to

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
answer you press show answer and if you

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
remembered it correctly you then you

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
then write like how easy or hard it was

146
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,039
for you to remember

147
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
and uh so this is just like a software

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,759
implementation of this

149
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,840
algorithm um

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
let's see uh right so

151
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,440
uh

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
anki has a lot of nice things it's a

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,240
multi-platform it's also on android

154
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
it has a synchronization server which is

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
not open source

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,800
but there are a couple of open source

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
ones there's syntax highlighting there's

158
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
lots of pre-made cards which for lots of

159
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
subjects especially people like medicine

160
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,400
students you have to memorize a lot of

161
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
stuff they make a lot of cards there's

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
cards for every like major language

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
there are stacks that you can add on

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
your notes and uh the the cards that you

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
create in anki are html plus javascript

166
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
so you can script them you can make them

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
potentially interactive

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
and also it has an active developer

169
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
community uh there's a here's a couple

170
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
of examples of stuff that i uh like to

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
do with anki this is one addon where

172
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
this is an add-on which is useful for

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
memorizing things which you can

174
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
represent as images so this is this is

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
the map of all these annoying tiny

176
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
islands in the

177
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
caribbean

178
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
and like um and this is an svg where

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
there's uh the name of the island and uh

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
you can like overlap these things over

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
it and then uh

182
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
the then then like the opposite side of

183
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
the card shows you the actual name of

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
the thing and this is useful especially

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
for like anatomy like whatever can be

186
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
represented as an image or like this is

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
like a some kind of neural network

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
thingy

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
um it also supports latex so you can

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
very very nicely use it for mathematics

191
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
for like definitions uh theorems

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
uh also i made a thing called permute

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
disclose and i use it to memorize things

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,639
which i confuse so for example like uh i

195
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
used to not be able to remember like

196
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
what type of radiation is alpha beta

197
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,720
gamma and uh this is a card where every

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
time you you see the card it will

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
randomly permute these rows so on every

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,639
permutation you will see a different

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
order of them and you have to remember

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,919
which one is which so like under the

203
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
under this they're the answer that this

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
asks for is like that gamma radiation

205
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
consists of

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
uh

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,039
of photons and beta consists of

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,479
electrons or procedures and alpha

209
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,639
accounts of helium nuclei

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
or like i can use it to like memorize

211
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
like which type of pasta is which which

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,479
is a very useful skill

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,759
yes

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,199
so uh

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,080
i've heard a lot of people use at least

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
like trying anki but

217
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
some people have problems like actually

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
putting it into practice and there's

219
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,360
there's a couple of tips which are good

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
to follow uh one of them is uh

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
one of them is using these closed

222
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
deletions

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
a close deletion

224
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,680
is a thing where you have some text and

225
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
you remove a bit of the text and you ask

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
to complete the middle that's a very

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
useful way to phrase these questions

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
then uh

229
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,720
it's good to treat your collection as

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
like a work of love to like refactories

231
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
to like go through it make sure that

232
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
like everything is phrased like the

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
optimal way

234
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
that like every card is asking for

235
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
exactly one fact to recall and not like

236
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
asking you to recall like you don't want

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
to have a card where the front says

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
aristotle and the back says like 50

239
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,279
facts about aristotle because then if

240
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
you see the word aristotle you you can't

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
recall all the 50 things at once you

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,958
want to have like 50 cards for each

243
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,720
individual thing

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
um it's also good when you're reviewing

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
cards it's good to notice where there

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
are problems like if you're if you're

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
noticing oh i always keep confusing

248
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
these two words

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
then it's good to notice that and like

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
note it down in anki and later go over

251
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,160
it and try to fix it in some fashion

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
then right i talked about redundancy and

253
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,200
atomicity and

254
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
anki is really nice for like

255
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
gamification purposes like it's a thing

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
which i do in all of these this like

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
that time when i'm like waiting in a

258
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
queue standing in public transit or like

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
sitting on the toilet uh and that means

260
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
that like over a day if i have a bad day

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
i might review maybe like five cards if

262
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
i have a good day if i'm like flying on

263
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
an airplane if i have like 10 hours to

264
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,320
spare i will review maybe like a

265
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
thousand even

266
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
uh here's a bunch of links um all of

267
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
these links are in my slides which uh

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
which are not linked here but you can

269
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,399
find them on the wiki

270
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
uh there's like a there's like a bunch

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
of documentation recommended plugins

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,320
and

273
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
that's the end of the content and i can

274
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
also show you a demo

275
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,480
uh how much time do we have

276
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
enough okay

277
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,360
okay so uh this is uh my anki setup this

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
is this is like uh the main window

279
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
and uh

280
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
um

281
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,959
if i click on all i i just it contains

282
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,640
even like stuff that i don't want to

283
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
necessarily show publicly like like

284
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
people that i know who probably wouldn't

285
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
want their faces to be public

286
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
uh but like uh here uh let's see if i

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
can make this bit bigger

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
um

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
i'm gonna hope that you guys can see

290
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
this like this is the card where it asks

291
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
me uh to overwrite working copies read

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,640
me with the content of of the readme

293
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,399
on the master branch and here's the

294
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,399
command line saying git

295
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
question mark source master with bmd and

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
this is asking me to remember the word

297
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,880
restore

298
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,279
so i press space and it shows me the

299
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
correct answer and then i uh rate that i

300
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
remember this like good this was good

301
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,320
and then here i have a little bit of

302
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
python like this is asking me for like

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,360
daytime the date of uh 20 whatever

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,000
whatever like the constructor daytime

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
days today actually yeah

306
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
um this is like this is the thing which

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
i like learned about like earlier on

308
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
this uh camp that there is a term called

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
the process window

310
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,519
that's like a range of acceptable

311
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
parameters

312
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
for some process

313
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
or

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
like here i have some like random thing

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,040
about stocks

316
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
um this is the thing where um where i

317
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,399
have

318
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
where like you know the terms meteorite

319
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
meteor meteoroid asteroid

320
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
like this these all are subtly different

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,920
and

322
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
just like yesterday i added a card where

323
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
i decided i want to remember which one

324
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
is which

325
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
um

326
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
or like i use it to memorize also like

327
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
country flex this is armenia this is i

328
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
think latvia

329
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
yeah

330
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,200
um or like capitals uh this is tirana

331
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,760
um this is santiago

332
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
uh this is

333
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
i think venezuela north carolina

334
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
colombia

335
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
uh 2016 uh

336
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,279
this is like alias is for oh my csh

337
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
this is super useful especially for like

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,959
getting better at using your computer

339
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
and using whatever tools you have

340
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
because often tools will have keyboard

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
shortcuts and uh it's good to memorize

342
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,680
them because then you're like way faster

343
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
um okay i think i think that's about

344
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
like all like all the interesting stuff

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
that i can show

346
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,240
shall we have questions

347
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,880
[Applause]

348
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,680
if

349
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
if there are any questions

350
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,160
there are mics in the path in the middle

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,480
no okay then another big applause

352
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
so for the next speaker i was a little

353
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
confused at his subject because the

354
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
title was

355
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
how to survive 100 meters underwater and

356
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
i was thinking about programming but

357
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
it's super cool it's about scuba diving

358
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
and how to survive it

359
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
and the technical aspects of it so i

360
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
can't wait to see what he's going to

361
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,518
tell and give a big applause

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,560
spinning ball of death of course

363
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,720
so for the past few years uh

364
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,279
uh i've been uh scuba diving quite a bit

365
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,160
uh a few years ago i went on vacation to

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,639
thailand uh because my manager said okay

367
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,000
you really need to have uh some vacation

368
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
and i was working too much and after i

369
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
booked everything like a few weeks

370
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
before

371
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,160
i thought okay what am i actually going

372
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
to do there

373
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
and yeah i happen to go scuba diving and

374
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
i got addicted

375
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
now uh just before kovit i decided let's

376
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
spend a lot of money and buy some

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,079
technical diving gear because if you've

378
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,639
ever scuba dived uh then you got your

379
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
certification from petty ssi or one of

380
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,839
the other

381
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,880
certifications and in that standard

382
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
course which is usually a few days you

383
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
learn okay don't go deeper than 30

384
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
meters because that's dangerous

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
and you don't know how to deal with that

386
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,959
etc

387
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,920
so

388
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
everything beyond that is pretty much

389
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
called technical diving and that is what

390
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
i've been doing for the past few years

391
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
um now and it seems that a lot of people

392
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
that dive have some relation to i.t and

393
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
i was talking to some people around here

394
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
and i was like okay i made a cool dive

395
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,519
last march in thailand

396
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
i

397
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,120
did a dive in a cave to 100 meter depth

398
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
it's called the song hong cave

399
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
and these are some photos here with me

400
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,360
and the equipment that i went down with

401
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
i'm not sure if you still see something

402
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,599
but okay

403
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,639
so

404
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
what you see here uh is what the bottles

405
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
uh that uh or the tanks that i had on my

406
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
back and additional tanks that you need

407
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,480
for decompression and such

408
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
so to be perfectly clear right i'm not

409
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
the scuba instructor i don't have the

410
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
intention to ever becoming one

411
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,920
because i don't really like uh that part

412
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,880
of the

413
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,000
diving and it's too commercial for my uh

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
taste

415
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
um but don't try this at home i i assume

416
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,839
that you don't have 100 meter uh the

417
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,160
pool but seriously

418
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
if you'd like to do this very cool i'd

419
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
be happy to give some tips but you do

420
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
need your

421
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
training and

422
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
your certifications and such

423
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,639
plus

424
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,880
if you do any certifications or theory

425
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
around it the first line is okay this is

426
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
dangerous you take a lot of risks know

427
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
what you're getting yourself into

428
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
now um

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,199
this is a a log what you can see

430
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,519
where i did the dive

431
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,959
so i'm not sure if you can read the

432
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
details but it took me about 25 minutes

433
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,199
to go down

434
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,079
because in a cave in that case you don't

435
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,600
go straight down because there's

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
actually rock beneath you

437
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,480
and it took me about 25 minutes to get

438
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
to 100 meter

439
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
now i could spend very long time there

440
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
two minutes

441
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
and then i had to go back up so i it

442
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
took me 25 minutes to go down to 100

443
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,720
meter i spent there two minutes looking

444
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,399
at uh

445
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
people that put all their tags on the

446
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
line like uh

447
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
showing hey i've been here and then we

448
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,360
went back up

449
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
and i had

450
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,639
over 90 minutes of decompression

451
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,399
now if you're not familiar with scuba

452
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,120
diving and what ld compression is so if

453
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
you do these deep dives

454
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
you uh

455
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,679
you breathe air and if you breed air

456
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,280
here uh we breed about 21 oxygen and 79

457
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,839
nitrogen and some other little gases but

458
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
that's about it

459
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,839
if you go underwater the pressure

460
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,799
increases and the molecules get closer

461
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,959
to each other and you basically uh

462
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,760
breathe more of that same gas

463
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,559
now

464
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
with oxygen that is not necessarily a

465
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,960
problem because your body takes care of

466
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,160
it and that's fine

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,760
the problem here is with nitrogen or

468
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
if you go very deeper you add some

469
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
helium

470
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
that gets into your tissues and

471
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
under heavy pressure that's a kind of

472
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,919
okay but if you go back up it expands

473
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
now uh what you want to prevent there is

474
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
that uh um there will become bubbles in

475
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
your tissues

476
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,080
because those bubbles can get

477
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,799
in

478
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,720
between nerves and

479
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
in your back in your spine you can get

480
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,240
paralyzed or you can even die

481
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,200
in the worst case scenario

482
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,440
now the other problem is what kind of

483
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,160
gases do you actually breathe so i made

484
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,960
a list of uh how it would look like if i

485
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,480
would go down with

486
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
the same uh mixture of gases that we

487
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
breathe here

488
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
now you have something called the

489
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,440
partial pressure and together you see

490
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
that it's a hundred percent um so

491
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
uh that doubles uh or

492
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
a ten meter that doubles and then

493
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,360
increases at same steps every ten meters

494
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,400
there are two problems here um one is at

495
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
some point you get narcotic um

496
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,640
and that is

497
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
because of the night virgin

498
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
and

499
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
uh that gives you a happy feeling uh

500
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,799
maybe even stoned which is cool but not

501
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
so cool if you're 100 meters underwater

502
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,400
and you don't know what to do anymore

503
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
um so what you do to prevent that is

504
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
that you replace part of the nitrogen by

505
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,559
helium which is a lighter gas and

506
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
doesn't cause

507
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,120
those same effects it does have other

508
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
effects such as

509
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,840
a very high

510
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,799
voice which is kind of cool but

511
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
it has benefits for that as well the

512
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
downside of helium is that it's crazy

513
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
expensive so if you are like okay i want

514
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
to do that technical diving make sure

515
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,720
you bring a fat wallet because it's very

516
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
expensive um

517
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,600
to give you some insight for these dives

518
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
that i made in thailand were three deep

519
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
dives it costed me about a thousand

520
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
euros of gases alone

521
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,039
so uh and that's apart from everything

522
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
else

523
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,039
now the other problem is uh the oxygen

524
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,559
at some point oxygen gets poisonous and

525
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,640
we typically indicate that on the

526
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
partial pressure of the oxygen

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
and

528
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,039
in diving in general the partial

529
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
pressure of 1.4

530
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
that is the limit that you go to

531
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,400
or that you can have and that means that

532
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
at 1.4

533
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,400
you don't get convulsions yet

534
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
but anything higher if you have a high

535
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
workload so if you're swimming if you're

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,320
doing stuff

537
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,159
uh it could happen um and uh getting

538
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
convulsions here and dropping on the

539
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,799
floor

540
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
kind of okay

541
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
we can handle that if you black out

542
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
underwater and you stop reading or

543
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
whatever

544
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,080
yeah that's not so cool anymore so um

545
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
what you do

546
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,799
for these deep dives is that you

547
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
actually decrease the uh the oxygen

548
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,919
because uh what you do is um

549
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,039
say on these deep dives what i did i had

550
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,840
13 of oxygen

551
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
and that means that i can't breathe here

552
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
yeah you can take one or two breath but

553
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
at some point you will pass out uh you

554
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
won't die immediately but uh that also

555
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,799
means that uh you can only breed it uh

556
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
when the po2 gets high enough for your

557
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,760
brain and oxy uh the oxygen to be

558
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
processed

559
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
so

560
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
um

561
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,159
yeah

562
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
that means that you have to carefully uh

563
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
plan everything uh when you're going

564
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,400
down on

565
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
such a

566
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,400
such a trip

567
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,919
now they're great tools for doing that

568
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
subsurface is one of them

569
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,159
it's an open source tool it was

570
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,799
originally designed and designed by lena

571
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,679
still falls who also was or is a scuba

572
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,050
diver um

573
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,480
[Music]

574
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
but um yeah so

575
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
what i did here i made a quick example

576
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,919
how i would plan a dive to a 100 meter

577
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,520
so

578
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,200
what you are seeing here is that i'm

579
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
having a double 12 as they call it which

580
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
means there are two tanks on your back

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,679
12 liter

582
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,720
and i have three additional tanks with

583
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
a decompression gases

584
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
because you want on your way back all

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
that gas is still in your tissues you

586
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,640
want to increase the oxygen

587
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,440
at a proper depth to make sure that you

588
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
breathe less of the inert gases like

589
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
helium and

590
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
nitrogen and to make sure that it goes

591
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
out of your tissues and then at some

592
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
point you can surface

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,830
um

594
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,320
[Music]

595
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,120
yeah

596
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
so um what you see here uh for example

597
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,320
if uh people can read it is that uh i go

598
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,720
down uh on my 50 oxygen now i do that

599
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
for the reason is that on the surface i

600
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,960
cannot actually breathe the

601
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
mix that i had in my back tanks i only

602
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
had 13 of oxygen

603
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,640
so at some point i switch to what i have

604
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
for my gas and then i can go deeper

605
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
um now at that point i am at 100 meters

606
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,760
and

607
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
then i can go up now how do i decide

608
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
when i want to go back up so

609
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
if you are diving in caves or doing deep

610
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,640
technical dives there's the golden rule

611
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,360
of the one-third of gas so the idea is

612
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
that in your planning you always assume

613
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,840
that you want to surface with one-third

614
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
of your gas because if something goes

615
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
wrong

616
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
that means that you still have

617
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
sufficient gas left

618
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,159
to

619
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
come back to the surface

620
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,880
so

621
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
in your entire planning you

622
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,559
basically do that

623
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,720
now there's one other uh switch that you

624
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
see a bit later on when i go up uh that

625
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
is actually also uh with helium combined

626
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,559
um

627
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
and there's something called isobaric

628
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,120
counter diffusion i have no idea who

629
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
came up with that term but

630
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,440
um if you switch very

631
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
quickly to a

632
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
between helium and nitrogen

633
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,320
there could be side effects uh you can

634
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,720
get dizzy and whatnot and what i said

635
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,279
earlier if you get dizzy here that's all

636
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,360
okay

637
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
being that on the water not such a good

638
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
idea

639
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
what you see in the rest of the planning

640
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
at some point i go to 50

641
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,039
that's typically at 21 meters depth and

642
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,799
then at 6 meters depth you switch to 100

643
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,400
oxygen which means that at that 6 meters

644
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,919
you are at

645
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,919
po2 of 1.6 and you might think earlier

646
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,000
didn't you say like okay

647
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,559
you have a maximum of 1.4

648
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
that is correct but the exception is for

649
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
decompression where the assumption is

650
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,520
you are pretty much still in the water

651
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
so you don't have much activity no high

652
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
workload

653
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
and as you can see after much time of

654
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
being still in the water

655
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
you can finally surface

656
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
so yeah

657
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
pretty much that is how you could

658
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
survive

659
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,720
but as i said at the beginning a lot of

660
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,440
planning training exercise comes into

661
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
that

662
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,919
so

663
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,880
yeah that's pretty much it

664
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,720
so

665
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
um obviously you can ask questions but i

666
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
had a question as well so how long does

667
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,760
a dive like this typically take

668
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
so uh that depends on the

669
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
decompression but in this case the one

670
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
that i did was

671
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
just over two two and a half hours wow

672
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,320
okay

673

the next speaker

678
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
he introduced himself and i asked what

679
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
he was going to talk about and he said

680
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,640
mosaic and i was like wow that's amazing

681
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,919
stones that's something i'm not a

682
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
programmer i can understand and it was

683
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,799
software but that actually made me more

684
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,320
excited because now i can learn about

685
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,880
something i had no idea about so i'm

686
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,360
here to introduce you to papine and he's

687
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,280
going to tell you about mosaic

688
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,120
[Applause]

689
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
i bought thomas laptop and i'm not sure

691
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,520
[Music]

692
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
uh it's uh i don't know it's his laptop

693
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
guy with the beard there

694
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,000
it's uh

695
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
oh my god

696
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
i can use any any random laptop that has

697
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,159
a web browser but

698
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,960
this one

699
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,559
no

700
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
i don't know maybe or is honey press

701
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,360
harder yeah okay

702
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
nasty

703
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,840
oh yeah so it's doing something

704
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
but it changed the screen resolution so

705
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,640
it detected it at least

706
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
does anyone have a laptop with hdmi they

707
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
can borrow

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,918
a laptop with hdmi

709
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,840
i kind of wanted to show the

710
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
thing like i can use any web any laptop

711
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
with like a web browser and hdmi um

712
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,039
i mean i can just tell about it but it's

713
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
kind of boring

714
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
okay

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
maybe test

716
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,799
oh there's someone

717
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,960
okay so there are a couple people

718
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,760
solving the issue

719
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,320
that's a great idea so

720
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
um we're going to swap around some

721
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,279
things

722
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,279
so the next speaker let's see

723
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,600
is

724
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
richard and he is going to tell about a

725
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,880
subject i think is so cool it's called a

726
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,960
furby who here has heard of the furby

727
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
me too i had one when i was uh when i

728
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,679
was a little bit smaller and then my

729
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,080
little brother dropped it off the stairs

730
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,799
so it broke down but my dad he actually

731
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,120
opened it up so he took all the skin off

732
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,880
and looked at the mechanics for him it

733
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,760
was cool for me nightmare material but

734
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
richard here is going to tell you a lot

735
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
about his furby and all the cool things

736
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,520
that it can do so give a big applause

737
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,040
for richard

738
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,720
[Applause]

739
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
i don't have a mic but i'm going to talk

740
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
about furby and i have to improvise too

741
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,919
because there's a quick change in

742
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,360
speaker slides you hold mic

743
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,039
okay

744
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,840
and do we have a stage for my co-speaker

745
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,480
furby you can grab a chair for me

746
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,520
thank you

747
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
okay

748
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
and i'm going to share a presentation

749
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,840
and

750
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
so actually i'm going to talk a bit

751
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
about what i'm doing here uh i'm talking

752
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
about uh furby

753
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
oops

754
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
screen sharing

755
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,039
there is yeah

756
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,000
okay cool so i have furby here

757
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
and i'm going to put him on the chair

758
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
because he's very important

759
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
oh that doesn't work

760
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,240
all right um

761
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,039
i'm afraid if you can't see it that well

762
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,760
if

763
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,039
if they do demo we'll figure it out

764
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,000
later so i'm talking about furby furby

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,559
is a 90s tool that

766
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,200
can talk and speak

767
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,960
you might remember it but i'm going to

768
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,519
upgrade it

769
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,120
why does not click

770
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,159
okay so we have the old school furby the

771
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,679
old school furby had very limited

772
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,440
commands this had a few commands could

773
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
you say a few words it could do a few

774
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
movements it's very basic there have

775
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,480
been newer furbys since the 90s

776
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
but i really like this one because this

777
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,480
is the one i used to have

778
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,840
i'm trying to upgrade with a bit more

779
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,960
intelligence

780
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,679
so

781
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,120
the goal is that i'm going to have a

782
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,399
real live pet it can talk it can walk it

783
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,559
can maybe sing for me and i can talk to

784
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,399
it it will talk back it can control the

785
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,080
house

786
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,679
it can have expressions because it

787
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,279
already has a motor in there for doing

788
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,480
that

789
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,840
but the problem is it also has to be

790
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
fully private so i can run it at my home

791
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,919
without exposing any data to the cloud

792
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,399
or to google or to the amazon people

793
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,200
um

794
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,960
so i'm going to talk about how the furby

795
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,039
works so there's a really nice patent

796
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
that's online it'll show you all the

797
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,559
details and how the internal components

798
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
are which help me to create this

799
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,480
presentation

800
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
in the furby we have a speaker

801
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
we have fur and i'm going to talk about

802
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
the details here

803
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
in here in the furby there will be a

804
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,679
motor that has a worm wheel that drives

805
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,440
a little cog that controls all the

806
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,080
components with one motor so the eyes

807
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,320
the ears the mouth it's all connected to

808
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
one engine

809
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
um

810
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,880
so i'm going to see how i can make this

811
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,960
all work i'm going to put a raspberry pi

812
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
in there it's drw works pretty well with

813
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
fins inside

814
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
it has powerful enough to run on a

815
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,399
docker container and then can maybe use

816
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,880
it to use it as a wayward trigger or

817
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,200
relay speech to text to another server

818
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
if you want to see these components i

819
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
lift system here i also have it all on

820
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,080
github

821
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,640
so to make space for the raspberry pi

822
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,000
i removed

823
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
a little piece on the bottom so

824
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
it i cut it off with a cell

825
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,200
very gently

826
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,720
and now it fits really well with

827
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
raspberry pi and

828
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,279
a speaker hat

829
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,559
so

830
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,960
now it can do some dancing

831
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,960
so

832
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
yeah so

833
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,159
there's some music and i wanted to share

834
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,559
the music so it's now dancing but this

835
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
is one motor the motor is continuously

836
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,559
spinning which is beautiful and it looks

837
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,880
cool but i really want to have control

838
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,120
of one single expression i want to say

839
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,679
eyes open mouth closed eye ears up ears

840
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
down so to do this

841
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,960
um

842
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
there so we have a positioning of

843
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,679
components inside the furby in the furby

844
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
there's a wheel the wheel this is what

845
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,279
i'm talking about earlier is drive by

846
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,600
the motor it has a little wheel that is

847
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,960
connected to a

848
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,600
slide and the position of the hook from

849
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
the eyes is in one slide there's another

850
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,720
wheel for another gear another part

851
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
and the pin will slide through the wheel

852
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,039
and the position of the wheel will tell

853
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,079
how the eyes will look

854
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,359
to do this

855
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,520
we have a little wheel here

856
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,000
this wheel turns there's a little gap in

857
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,119
the wheel

858
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,119
and

859
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,440
when we have a light sensor in here it's

860
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,719
positioned

861
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
right here on the bottom there's a light

862
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
and then there's a sensor the wheel

863
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,719
turns and then there's a gap in the

864
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
wheel right there

865
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,239
that every time the light

866
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,480
is shining through the wheel we can

867
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,760
count it as a

868
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
pulse

869
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
and by this we can

870
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,760
very accurately

871
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,159
position all the engine parts and all

872
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,199
the

873
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
expressions and body parts with this one

874
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,199
wheel

875
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,560
so

876
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
these are all the settings that i have

877
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
but to demonstrate it i brought my furby

878
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,560
but i think i'm going to do a video here

879
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,880
i'm going to start here by doing the

880
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,040
calibration sequence i'm turning the

881
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,760
wheel full clock cycle to know when it

882
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,160
hits the button because every time the

883
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,320
wheel makes one full turn it presses a

884
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,280
button

885
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,520
now it says calibrated

886
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,599
the furby is now ready to go

887
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,280
so it starts at like

888
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,280
i press it down years up gears down

889
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
so i'm still trying to make a

890
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
combination of the expressions in here

891
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,920
and i can say okay

892
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
i want you now to sing a happy song for

893
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,520
me and it will go do that expression or

894
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
it will look disappointed at me or will

895
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,520
be bored

896
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,240
so now demonstrating every sequence

897
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,040
of this wheel

898
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
so it's going

899
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,079
uh as you can see i can really have full

900
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,520
control of where it stops and where it

901
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,759
goes

902
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,760
yeah it's it's really happy to see it

903
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,280
now

904
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,960
the furby clock works as follows if

905
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
the eyes are

906
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,520
let's say open and ears are high and i

907
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,119
want to go to here

908
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,640
i first have to go through all these

909
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,400
steps but i can probably toggle

910
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,599
somewhere with the expression here in

911
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,839
between or an expression in between here

912
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
this way i can really make an expression

913
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,160
that's a complete set

914
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,079
but like i said before

915
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
the whole thing should be private

916
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,640
so there's implementations of alexa that

917
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,359
you can install on your pi and you can

918
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
relay your whole house to alexa but this

919
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,599
is too easy and i don't want to do that

920
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,320
so i use raspy which is an open source

921
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,800
alexa program you can configure it and

922
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
run it on the pervy connect it to mqtt

923
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
we do the same thing on the biggest

924
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
server i have at the home

925
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,359
via pdp 11 and we connect it to a home

926
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,240
assistant and then you can relate mqtt

927
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,960
commands to home assistant

928
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
and then control the u lights and then

929
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,599
the utilize consecutively when you for

930
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,280
instance walk into a room

931
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,200
the motion sensor triggers

932
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
it sends an mqtt event

933
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,560
then the mqtt event will publish a rest

934
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,280
call to the furby to make an expression

935
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,240
and to also do some text to speech

936
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,479
so

937
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,400
this is how it works

938
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,320
i need to get some breath okay

939
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,119
with raspy you can do custom wayward

940
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,359
detection that means that if i now say

941
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,119
hey furby it will tell me hi back

942
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,359
so

943
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,450
hey furby

944
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:39,920
[Laughter]

945
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
i don't know if you heard that but very

946
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
people singing

947
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,079
when i said hey furby so

948
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,920
with raspy you can make your own wake

949
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,359
words set up

950
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,640
there's probably a tool that's not part

951
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,598
of recipe to do that

952
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,760
but it's really nice to set it up

953
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,040
cool

954
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,599
now to configure recipe we have a few

955
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,960
sentences it's like what time is it or

956
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
tell me with the time

957
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,640
you write the sentences down

958
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,960
this sentence then triggers an mqtt

959
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,040
event that goes to home assistant

960
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
and then it also triggers the furby to

961
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
have this kind of like nice effect

962
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,640
so this is home assistant

963
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,079
if you don't have a furby it's still

964
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,920
pretty cool to set it up

965
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,359
you can easily integrate with everything

966
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,520
in your house it's open source you can

967
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,359
make shell scripts you can put it all in

968
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,359
a git repository you can easily deploy

969
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,280
it and manage it it's a really nice tool

970
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,400
to play around with on the weekend

971
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
so the whole project is still work in

972
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
progress

973
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,359
so i showed you now that i have gained

974
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,560
full control on how the furby looks

975
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,640
but i want to make this into a sequence

976
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,200
of events that can combine make an

977
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
expression

978
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,079
so with this expression i can make a

979
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,760
rest call and then connect the rest

980
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,680
server to the mqtt server

981
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
and of course

982
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,440
we have the furby here but there's still

983
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,839
plenty of room for camera so i can also

984
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,079
add face repetition and image

985
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
recognition and then make it like a real

986
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
animal that will be happy to see you of

987
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
course

988
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,760
the whole project

989
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,520
kind of works now quite predictably so

990
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,680
it's not as nice as a cat the cats will

991
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,599
greet you or not

992
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
maybe it will not greet you the dog will

993
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
or not

994
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
so

995
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,320
for me this is like quite boring so it's

996
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,599
only magic if you understand that

997
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,440
somebody said this to somebody yesterday

998
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,400
i thought it was quite funny um

999
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
so i want to met some randomness or some

1000
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,760
unpredictable or some intelligence that

1001
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,480
will be like surprising or nice to see

1002
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,800
so it will become magic and like real

1003
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,119
pets

1004
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,520
it is online it is on github

1005
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,359
so you can look at the source it's still

1006
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,680
very basic right now so i still want to

1007
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,440
put all the slides that i made today

1008
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
because the whole idea came up yesterday

1009
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,119
and

1010
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,560
i need to like document it's like when

1011
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
you look through the code you can still

1012
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,079
like look at all the references and make

1013
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,920
sense of it

1014
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
that's my email address and if you have

1015
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,760
other ideas please come talk to me and

1016
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
i'd love to

1017
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
add more to this project or share it

1018
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,599
with you

1019
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,000
thank you

1020
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,920
well thank you richard that was amazing

1021
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
i learned so much if anyone has any

1022
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,920
questions again they're mike's in the

1023
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,560
middle or you could email or well just

1024
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,839
ask

1025
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,480
so uh thank you thank you and then for

1026
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,599
the next speaker

1027
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,119
uh you want to share your slides in here

1028
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,359
right

1029
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,119
okay

1030
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,200
i have to show

1031
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,839
where is

1032
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,920
it are you going to go last

1033
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,640
okay so a little exchange of plans just

1034
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,800
to let you know there are two more talks

1035
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
so in the program there was only one but

1036
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,560
now there are going to be two more talks

1037
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,319
uh you can go last if that's okay with

1038
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,200
you does it work

1039
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,880
is it oh sorry you have to change the

1040
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,720
keyboard layouts there we go

1041
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,040
so our next talk i already introduced

1042
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
it's about mosaic and now the laptop

1043
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,599
works which is amazing

1044
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,079
and he's going to talk about like i said

1045
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,599
mosaic so another applause and then he

1046
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,000
can start

1047
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,000
can i like do it full screen

1048
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,760
the website yeah yeah sure and then

1049
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,160
you want to look at readme no i'll just

1050
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
the website here

1051
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,399
oh

1052
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,880
okay

1053
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
let's give another try

1054
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,640
uh amp pine and um yeah i'm originally a

1055
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,240
software developer and then i studied

1056
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,560
electrical engineering and i see design

1057
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,240
and then i figured that actually the

1058
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,319
software that i see designers use is

1059
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,520
kind of

1060
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,359
not so great

1061
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
so i decided to

1062
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,800
write open source software for ic

1063
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,880
designers

1064
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,560
so this project

1065
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,319
is basically

1066
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,280
that it's a schematic editor for ic

1067
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,480
design

1068
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,920
you can also use it for us like

1069
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,280
simulating other stuff so it's like

1070
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
basically a spy simulator interface

1071
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,079
um

1072
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,119
and

1073
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,640
i will talk a bit about it but also what

1074
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,119
i want to do i see a few people with

1075
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,920
laptops one nice thing about this or

1076
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,839
like different thing about this app is

1077
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,079
that it's online and collaborative

1078
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,040
so

1079
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,720
if people with laptops in their labs um

1080
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
will go to nian cad with a d at the end

1081
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
dot github dot io mosaic

1082
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,680
and then you can go to try online

1083
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,359
we can actually edit the same schematic

1084
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,920
and i will be able to see hopefully

1085
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,520
what people in the audience are drawing

1086
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,119
which will be i think a funny experiment

1087
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,520
um

1088
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
this is the

1089
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,440
main uh

1090
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,800
yeah so this is the entry point of the

1091
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,240
application where you sort of manage

1092
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
your libraries and your models and your

1093
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,200
stuff

1094
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,119
uh you see the little spinny thing in

1095
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,480
the corner it means it's like

1096
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,760
downloading

1097
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,079
uh the database now because it's by

1098
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,560
default it's uh it talks to a couchdb

1099
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,200
database in the cloud

1100
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,319
um

1101
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,200
so

1102
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,079
uh yeah it will synchronize

1103
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,760
your schematics there

1104
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,520
but you can also use it offline it's

1105
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,480
like an offline first web calculation so

1106
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,280
if you like go in workspace properties

1107
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,359
and remove the synchronization url you

1108
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,520
have a purely offline

1109
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
application you can also run your own

1110
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,319
cause to be or whatever

1111
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,000
and

1112
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
can i go to the previous tab while it's

1113
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,400
loading

1114
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,079
um

1115
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,400
oh

1116
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,319
okay i will just add an interface and

1117
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,920
see what happens so

1118
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,160
let's design

1119
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,240
a filter

1120
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,399
or something

1121
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,240
and

1122
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,119
add a schematic i mean name it mch

1123
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,599
filter

1124
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,119
and now if i

1125
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,319
like

1126
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,400
in theory this should eventually show up

1127
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
on

1128
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,440
your

1129
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,560
version of the thing if you have a

1130
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
laptop in your lap

1131
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,319
and if you double click it you can open

1132
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,880
the editor

1133
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
um

1134
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,440
yeah this is the main editor

1135
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,200
um

1136
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,760
it's designed to be like very easy easy

1137
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,240
to use but also quite powerful so you

1138
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,000
can like everything has like you know

1139
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,640
mouse buttons that should be obvious but

1140
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,119
you can also hide all the stuff and use

1141
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,760
keep keyboard shortcuts for everything

1142
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,640
so i can like press r and then we'll

1143
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,800
place a resistor

1144
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,520
oh it looks kind of a bit broken maybe

1145
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
the css is a bit not loaded

1146
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
anyway

1147
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,920
hello

1148
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
help

1149
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,760
how do i get

1150
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
back to

1151
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,359
like

1152
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,200
no but like i did this like where they

1153
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,760
zoomed out of the window

1154
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,359
and i'm not sure why how i couldn't get

1155
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,599
back into the

1156
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,200
this is like an apple thing i'm just not

1157
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,359
like

1158
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,839
also let's

1159
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,480
because they had to talk to furby ah

1160
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,240
okay you're on your own different work

1161
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,119
um okay maybe it's not completely broken

1162
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,960
um

1163
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,720
anyway let's delete this one

1164
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,240
and place a voltage source

1165
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,839
and draw some wires

1166
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,760
and some more wires

1167
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
okay it's quite

1168
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,000
difficult to do with one hand

1169
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
um

1170
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,760
yeah so that's uh the basic

1171
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,880
idea

1172
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,119
uh it seems to oh and i'm scared to

1173
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,480
press escape now because when i press

1174
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,680
escape previously it did something

1175
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
weird

1176
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,280
anyway

1177
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,359
so next thing i can show like i assume

1178
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,280
nobody has made it to

1179
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,119
this place yet because i don't see

1180
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,400
anyone else edit showing up

1181
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,200
what i can try now is to run actually a

1182
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,280
simulation in the cloud

1183
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,040
so what normally what you would do is

1184
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,880
you can install this like so now it's

1185
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,040
running purely as a web application but

1186
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,079
of course if you want to run a

1187
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,680
simulation you need to run some

1188
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,839
simulation somewhere

1189
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,280
there's also a desktop installation

1190
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,720
which is based on jupiter lab

1191
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,800
but there's also

1192
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,280
this thing called mybinder which allows

1193
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,240
you to like turn a docker repository or

1194
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,839
like a github browser into a docker

1195
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,880
image and then run it into the cloud

1196
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,119
um so i mean

1197
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,720
demo effect this will not probably not

1198
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,760
work but it's technically yeah okay

1199
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,160
good luck um

1200
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,319
it should be possible to like launch

1201
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,160
instantly into a cloud environment where

1202
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720
you can just like run a spy simulator

1203
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,960
that's open source

1204
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,680
to simulate your thing

1205
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,720
but obviously not today

1206
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,800
so

1207
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,119
i mean yeah that's i'm not sure what

1208
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,720
else i

1209
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
want to show

1210
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,640
you can manage libraries draw schematics

1211
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,839
simulate them but yeah that basically

1212
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,920
what i wanted to say is there's like a

1213
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,680
an easy to use interface for like you

1214
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,440
know clickety click just draw a

1215
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,640
schematic and run basic simulations

1216
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,480
there's also like a notebook interface

1217
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
where you can like write python code to

1218
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,680
run simulations for more advanced

1219
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,200
automation

1220
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
um

1221
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
and

1222
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,359
yeah

1223
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,880
well here you can see a bit of the

1224
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,200
simulation interface but

1225
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,240
it's a bit

1226
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,520
small

1227
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,800
and of course nothing works but anyway i

1228
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,040
just wanted to show this and

1229
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,559
if you're interested you can play around

1230
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,640
or ask me about it or

1231
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,558
whatever that's all i have i guess

1232
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,000
too bad

1233
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,680
too bad that there are so many wi-fi

1234
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,839
issues mine has been overloaded all day

1235
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
it's like you try to load one wikipedia

1236
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,839
page and the thing has a seizure i can

1237
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,960
say that because i have epilepsy um

1238
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,520
if there are any questions again mics

1239
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,960
are in the middle but i think they can

1240
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,040
also just approach you yeah

1241
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,160
and um

1242
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,760
don't be afraid to check it out i think

1243
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,520
you could just play around with it and

1244
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,240
uh yeah it's on github yeah it's like uh

1245
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,760
github dot io slash mosaic okay so if i

1246
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,040
want to try this out what should i

1247
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,240
google or magnet mosaic

1248
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,078
okay well thank you so much

1249
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,800
[Music]

1250
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
then our next speaker is going to speak

1251
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,200
about a subject that i as the younger

1252
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,520
generation although it's maybe bad to

1253
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,200
say that are going to have a lot of

1254
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,760
problems with which is climate change

1255
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,280
but not only are we going to have

1256
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,200
problems with it in the future we are

1257
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,640
already experiencing so many issues so

1258
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,400
the next talk is going to be about how

1259
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,680
we should take action now

1260
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,078
thank you

1261
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,720
hello

1262
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,440
thank you thank you my name is mdb um

1263
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
also in my dream so of course calling

1264
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,359
myself daiya or darya in english with

1265
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,200
five letters

1266
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,119
and formally i dreamed about um

1267
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,200
dreaming together with other people i

1268
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,800
dreamed about the world trade center as

1269
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,160
well like

1270
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,760
driving one

1271
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,680
two-seater into the world trade center

1272
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,040
and others

1273
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,280
go dreamed this into a big airplane and

1274
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,559
that was a mess

1275
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,119
in my dreams so

1276
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,480
okay

1277
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
i also dreamed about

1278
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,800
climate catastrophes happening which are

1279
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,040
already happening now

1280
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,079
and

1281
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,319
i did refuse to

1282
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,119
think about or imagine what could go

1283
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,400
worse

1284
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,960
in the

1285
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,960
in the sense that in in the hope that

1286
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,480
with knowing

1287
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,440
what is coming towards us

1288
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,119
told by scientists

1289
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,359
the people especially the people in

1290
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,559
power

1291
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,040
would change their

1292
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,280
courses the course of humanity to the

1293
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,280
better and avoid such things

1294
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
but

1295
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,640
it's all rigged we have a money system

1296
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,800
monetary system that is

1297
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,200
driving even more money to money and

1298
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,720
money and

1299
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,640
totally forgetting about the environment

1300
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,599
um

1301
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,680
everyone

1302
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,319
can rethink about 2021

1303
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,480
and i think everyone has

1304
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,119
memories of

1305
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,839
catastrophes happening globally

1306
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,839
at least twice a week

1307
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,119
and this was not the case years ago or

1308
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,920
decades ago

1309
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,240
we are now having temperatures rising

1310
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,920
very much

1311
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,200
more and more

1312
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,160
and

1313
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,359
net zero and

1314
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,440
stay of co2 in the air in the in the

1315
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,720
atmosphere

1316
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,079
is based on sinks available like amazon

1317
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,119
forest

1318
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,559
like

1319
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,440
the great barrier reef around all around

1320
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,760
the continent of australia

1321
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,400
and also the plankton in the mirror and

1322
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,960
the top layers of the seas of the oceans

1323
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
we all know

1324
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,800
amazon

1325
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,480
forest has been reduced very much

1326
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,359
the

1327
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,880
um

1328
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,760
the the the reefs have been

1329
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,520
are dying and are mostly dead meanwhile

1330
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,319
and

1331
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,000
by diffusion of co2 into the topper top

1332
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,880
layers of the oceans in the top

1333
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,480
sea surface

1334
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,240
that surface where the plankton is

1335
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,040
living is becoming a

1336
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,160
bubble

1337
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,240
water

1338
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,399
with

1339
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,400
h2co3

1340
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,640
with an acid with

1341
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,839
with acid

1342
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,920
becoming more and more acidic

1343
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,000
and this will lead to the plankton dying

1344
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,960
as well

1345
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,760
so the sinks for the co2 in the

1346
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,040
atmosphere

1347
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,559
are partially gone and some of them are

1348
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,280
going right now

1349
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,240
and

1350
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
the co2 that is now

1351
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,800
421 micro

1352
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,839
parts

1353
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,720
right above 121 ppm

1354
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,319
um

1355
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,880
will even raise

1356
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,720
some of it is not yet in the upper

1357
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,240
layers of the atmosphere where it's

1358
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,920
doing the worst

1359
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,680
effects

1360
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,559
heating up our planet and

1361
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,559
so what we have now like in 2021 will be

1362
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,119
our future for at least 20 years

1363
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,240
same

1364
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,640
as 2171 at least 20 years and with

1365
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
inaction and letting our

1366
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,599
rulers

1367
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,520
proceed to

1368
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,400
ruin everything

1369
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,280
sorry

1370
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,520
this will be so worse i mean

1371
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,280
i can imagine

1372
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,319
the floors in brandenburg around berlin

1373
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,160
are

1374
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,240
getting deserts this means the soil has

1375
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,720
obvious

1376
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,880
the earth is gone and it's mostly sand

1377
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,760
left over in branbook around berlin

1378
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,200
where the big droughts for the last few

1379
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,559
years have been

1380
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,760
and

1381
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,440
i imagine like

1382
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,559
we will have lots of

1383
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,960
um winds

1384
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,480
not only

1385
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,079
heat points like now

1386
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,280
still winds but also have heavy winds

1387
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,160
because these uh temperature differences

1388
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,440
need to be

1389
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,680
um

1390
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:58,960
um

1391
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,240
sorry

1392
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,720
equalized right they equalize each other

1393
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,599
and

1394
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,280
so the winds will get stronger also with

1395
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,319
higher temperatures i was told that

1396
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,839
every degree celsius gives the air seven

1397
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,920
percent more storage of water capacity

1398
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,960
um so there will be a

1399
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,720
stronger and

1400
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,240
heavier

1401
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,160
wind so to say

1402
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,319
it's probably hard to understand

1403
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,119
but

1404
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,240
winds will get stronger and we will have

1405
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,200
like in five years we will have probably

1406
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,720
within action at least within action we

1407
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,599
will have

1408
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,359
every day

1409
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,720
at least one tornado in every country in

1410
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
europe

1411
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,720
and it can be typhoons or tornadoes and

1412
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,640
as the soil is mostly sand there will be

1413
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,839
lots of sand so we get sandstorms

1414
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,880
and this is terrific not only for the

1415
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,799
living beings but also for the solar

1416
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,680
panels that are heavily damaged by

1417
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,200
sandstorms

1418
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,799
and of course it's not good for wind

1419
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,400
turbines as well

1420
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,240
so we will have lots and lots of trouble

1421
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,760
which is not

1422
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,720
being seen by our rulers our rulers are

1423
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,200
ignoring the ipcc um

1424
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,920
assessment report six currently

1425
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,760
which is with the management report

1426
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,720
very very bad despite the fact that

1427
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,480
there is filtering

1428
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,880
from the science single scientist at the

1429
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,920
bottom

1430
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,599
that has to

1431
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,680
take care what he is

1432
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,079
saying to the public

1433
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,319
for third for for his external payments

1434
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,480
still coming in and him not losing jobs

1435
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,720
for example germany the most scientists

1436
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,000
have only limited for two years working

1437
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,119
agreements

1438
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,480
so they are very much in danger of not

1439
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,400
being employed anymore

1440
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,559
if they lose their third

1441
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,200
external money sources

1442
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,440
um so they have

1443
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,839
to take care that they are not free to

1444
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,200
speech

1445
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,240
free to speak freely what they found out

1446
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,319
and what they think will happen and how

1447
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,359
it will be

1448
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,839
in the second level of the rpcc there's

1449
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:18,880
the group

1450
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,760
same thing happening again then the area

1451
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,040
of subject or area of um region

1452
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,720
same thing happening again and in the

1453
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,640
fourth level there is the management

1454
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,559
report which is talked with lobbies and

1455
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,680
governments and every word is gone

1456
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,640
through and checked against if that is

1457
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,720
maybe not what the governments really

1458
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,599
want to hear the public to hear

1459
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,400
so

1460
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,680
and still

1461
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,280
if you look at these pages it's about

1462
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,440
200 to 300 pages

1463
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,920
with different parts of the management

1464
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,119
summary

1465
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,720
if you go through this

1466
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,960
you will see it's very

1467
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,400
very bad

1468
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
to know this

1469
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,240
and

1470
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,040
i i

1471
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,640
i make a bet

1472
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,760
chancellor um

1473
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,240
our german chancellor did not read it he

1474
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,720
did not order anyone to read it and he

1475
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,880
has no one that has read it and telling

1476
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,760
him

1477
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,480
how bad it is even with government

1478
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,160
intervention and lobby intervention and

1479
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,960
everything i told you right now which is

1480
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,400
just logically i cannot prove it but you

1481
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,559
everyone knows how it is it's the world

1482
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:31,920
we live in

1483
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,280
and

1484
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,559
it's rigged

1485
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,520
maybe

1486
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,400
maybe maybe it would help to remove

1487
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,079
money globally

1488
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,640
but this is one thing that cannot be

1489
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,920
done by single persons or whatever

1490
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,240
so and i think this will not be done by

1491
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,079
our rulers at all

1492
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,920
but it would help a lot if you imagine

1493
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,440
um a

1494
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
society for

1495
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,880
requirements

1496
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,000
so everyone gets food

1497
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,799
water drinks whatever

1498
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,559
shelter

1499
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,599
and from time to time some fun of course

1500
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,920
not to spare it out and everyone needs

1501
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,880
the stuff

1502
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,200
he needs to do his work because we can't

1503
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,799
live with an exchange

1504
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,119
trade system because this would not

1505
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,920
allow specialists to continue the work

1506
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,400
and we need specialists for example for

1507
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,079
plutonium to keep

1508
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,920
we cannot keep this with hands we need

1509
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,160
technology we need to continue usually

1510
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,559
be able to use intelligent technology to

1511
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,160
contain the plutonium we have 300 tons

1512
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,040
1.3 1.3 million kilograms and one

1513
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,480
kilogram or five kilograms doesn't

1514
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
matter really

1515
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,079
equally distributed about it about the

1516
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,760
surface of the earth would be enough to

1517
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,680
kill all life

1518
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,480
and

1519
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,280
these

1520
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,880
1300

1521
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,760
tons 30 million kilograms

1522
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,040
13 giga grams

1523
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,520
of plutonium

1524
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,880
are mostly of that isotope that has 24

1525
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,480
000 years

1526
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,760
half time

1527
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,520
which means we have to keep it for

1528
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,359
another

1529
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:13,599
430 000 years

1530
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,960
safe

1531
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,200
to get back to

1532
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,240
an amount that is

1533
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,040
not really that harmful

1534
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,559
in theory

1535
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,240
in practice we have lots of

1536
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,520
pollutions

1537
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,460
wire

1538
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,480
[Music]

1539
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,480
without abiding

1540
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,000
manufacturing like um

1541
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,359
um um okay we love it lag

1542
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,680
again

1543
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,559
and also by

1544
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,960
accidents like chernobyl or

1545
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,640
in japan

1546
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,599
which

1547
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,400
and lost bombs of course lost

1548
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,040
nuclear nuclear bombs nuclear warheads

1549
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,920
um

1550
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,640
so we already have a kind of pollution

1551
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,599
that has to be removed sooner or later

1552
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,000
and after the climate crisis if we

1553
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,319
manage to go through this as a society

1554
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,480
as a working society as a

1555
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,520
fully um capable society

1556
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,440
next thing i think will be to collect

1557
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,319
the plutonium back from the earth to

1558
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,599
contain it and to treat it in a manner

1559
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,440
that has yet has to be invented

1560
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,650
thank you very much

1561
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:34,720
[Applause]

1562
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,880
well thank you on a talk that is a

1563
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,680
subject i personally find very important

1564
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,640
now again there are mags at the path so

1565
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,400
if anyone has

1566
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,839
any questions

1567
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,680
please ask them and i think you'll be

1568
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,599
approachable for questions afterwards as

1569
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,280
well yes sure yes so um that were the

1570
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,200
lightning talks for today

1571
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,280
a big applause for everyone who spoke

1572
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,440
