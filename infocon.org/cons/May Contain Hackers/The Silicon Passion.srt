fraulein you want green energy we build

120
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
windmills you want data we build data

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
centers i mean it's a great place they

122
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
can use the river water for cooling and

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
there's a high-speed access internet

124
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
junction nearby we do have to build a

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
data center somewhere yes but it doesn't

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
have to be her backyard

127

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,160
doesn't know what to do she goes home

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
with a heavy heart

131
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
cuts the zucchini and stares out the

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
window

133
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
and she decides to take action

134
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,000
she decides to take action she writes an

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
angry letter to the local newspaper

136
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
she writes to the city council and of

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440

138
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400

to the cops but all to know a veil yeah

142
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
it's now that looking out the window

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
becomes more difficult every time she's

144
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
starting to give up hope

145
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
starting to give up hope and thinking of

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
of moving away from the place where she

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
has lived her whole life

gave to me for my birthday a

258
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
game boy and i was just mesmerized by it

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
you know i i was stuck to the screen and

260

come on man not this whole angle not

267
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,079
this whole angle of technology and

268
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
progress corrupting the youth

269
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
i'm an early adopter too okay when i was

270
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
a kid there was no internet and then

271
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
when i was a teenager before i went on

272
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
vacation i would turn on my computer and

273
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
turn on limewire to download haiti also

274
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
andreas and then when i came back after

275
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
three weeks it still wasn't done and

276
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
even if it was done it probably didn't

277
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
even work but flash forward to now 2022

278
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
and the world is a completely different

279
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,720
place

280
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
i can stream all the music in the world

281
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
with a flick of my thumb i've learned

282
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
about stuff i would have otherwise never

283
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,000
known about

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
i have lights

285
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,160
in my house that change colors when i

286
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
walk into the room okay i love the

287
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
internet too i love it yeah me too

288
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
that's my point but

289
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
you know over the years this um

290
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
this feeling has grown that something is

291
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
a bit off

292
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
i i have a i have a friend and uh he's

293
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
been sucked in by this weird algorithm

294
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
so for the past two years he's been

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,200
getting all his news from one single

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,399
source but the thing is it's all

297
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
 you know just complete nonsense

298
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
so we've come to a point where we don't

299
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
even believe in each other's words and

300
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
worlds anymore

301
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
so when i come over to his place uh

302
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
we just don't mention the c word you

303
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
know but is that my friend's fault is he

304
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
a bit stupid or is he being controlled

305
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
by forces powerful more powerful than

306
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
him i don't know

307
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,000
i don't know i don't know what the

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
solution is i mean we need to do

309
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,600
something about it yeah yeah but i mean

310
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
where can we where can we go with this

311
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
yeah it's it's such a big problem right

312
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
yeah okay you can start personally

313
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
what if tanya from eisenhower gets a

314
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
call you know company

315
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800

316
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
has been forced to reach out and

317
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,720
compensate her okay uh or uh i overcome

318

it's not it yes but um

325
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,199

326
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,440

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
he

341
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,199
he you know he changed so much just by

342
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,279
printing a bible

343
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
you know he changed the whole world by

344
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,639
putting tiny iron letters together

345
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,519
morals change beliefs disappear

346
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,560

347
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
you know what i'm getting at you know

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
the question is

349
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
we need something to change

350
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,920
but can we even see the bigger picture

351
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,959
you know the internet is only 40 years

352
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
old and this story is just the beginning

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,120
how

354
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
do we

355
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,839
change the direction of the wave

356
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079

357
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480

explain ourselves

456
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
well let me start out by saying that we

457
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
here at big tech we've always been

458
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,799
dreamers for us progress means

459
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
connection and through that connection

460
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
uh a better understanding of one another

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
and the more compassionate just world

462
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
for all yes okay but what do you have to

463
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,480
say about all those problems in the

464
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480

yes

467
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,320
it's true

468
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
powerful technology plays a critical

469
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
role in all of this and with great power

470
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,880
comes great responsibility so to those

471
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
who say we are to blame

472
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
i have this to say

473
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,919
we're deeply

474
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
disappointed

475
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
we are disappointed with technology's

476
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,280
stubborn nature it sometimes seems to

477
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
misunderstand us but you know tech

478
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
should be here for us for you and for me

479
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
and together we want to improve it

480
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
you know sometimes the tech just slips

481
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,559
away a bit but

482
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,240
why blame us

483
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,960
people of the jury having heard these

484
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
words what do you say do the people at

485
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,640
big tech just get a free pass and can

486
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
they i don't know shift the blame

487
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,760
i'd like to call in as a witness itself

488
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,340

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,080
these preposterous accusations by big

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
tech

495
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,159
you

496
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,840

498
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,480

499
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
responsibility for your own actions

500
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,400
always on the lookout for next someone

501
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
or something to blame when you find

502
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,360
yourself

503
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
in a situation you are unhappy with or

504
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,240
when technology fails

fine

515
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
let's say

516
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
for the sake of the argument

517
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
that you are indeed superior that you

518
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
to a simple algorithm as myself

519
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
well

520
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
that would be even more frustrating

521
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,919
because you only seem to recognize your

522
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
own responsibility

523
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,799
when it's about your achievements

524
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,360
if things go wrong

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,199
you're not no one to blame

526
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,880
embrace

527
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,360
your humanity and take responsibility

528
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,480
come people having heard both

529
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,679
where does your anger lie now

530
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
who deserves our mistrust our scrutiny

531
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,559
is it truly the infallible humans of big

532
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
tech or the fallible technology

533
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,920
yet there are more voices to be heard

well uh

656
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,360
first of all i'd like to thank the court

657
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
for allowing me to speak i know i'm just

658
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,200
some two and a half thousand year old

659
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,840
white dude but uh hear me out

660
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,760
systems are complex man

661
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,919
most of us can barely even navigate what

662
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,000
our own brains are telling us let alone

663
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
an entire connected worldwide network

664
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,200
we are living in a time of infinite

665
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,559
complexity

666
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,679
worlds within worlds realities within

667
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,520
realities

668
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,159
caves within caves

669
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,360
truth seems as much one click away as it

670
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
seems lost in an infinite sea of

671
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
disinformation cat videos and weirdly

672
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
specific porn

673
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,240
it seems tempting to just you know give

674
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
in to the madness of it all eh

675
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,600
but the price that good people pay for

676
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
indifference is that bad people will

677
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
rule over them so if we take into

678
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,120
account the billions of times you have

679
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,600
all clicked i have read and agreed to

680
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,520
the terms of service

681
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,559
whilst having done no such thing

682
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,559
it's hardly a mystery how we ended up in

683
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,559
this show eh

684
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,360
but you sense some things wrong

685
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,240
you want out you want your pre-internet

686

we have reached a verdict

744
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,320
only one party is guilty here

745
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,760
only one

746
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,840
went about their ways recklessly and

747
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,559
only thought about themselves yes

748
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,679
it is

749
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,159

753
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,679

from our lives

759
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,679
we went to their website and threw away

760
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
our accounts

761
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
we danced together

762
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,399
in the summer of new connections not

763
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,560
worrying anymore

764
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,239
and the only sound that could be heard

765
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,040
was the voice of big tech begging

766
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,560
my user my user

767
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520

on a square

775
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,000
i feel the cobblestones beneath my feet

776
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
i see all around me people

777
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,520
looking for something to hold on to

778
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,880
shifting their balance and

779
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,079
i can't believe we're finally doing it

780
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,240
we're taking big tech out of our lives

781
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
and across the square i see a boy

782
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,960
walking into view he's clenching

783
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,359
something in his fist i i cannot yet see

784

what it is but

785

full of future

789
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,040
and as he makes his way across the

790
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,040
square and he lifts up his arm

791
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
he shouts

792
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,839
liberte and and the plastics and glass

793
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,440
break onto the cobblestone and all

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
around me i see clarity in the people's

eyes they start doing the same

796

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
five people

822
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,839

big networks

827
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,599

858
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,359
revenge porn no no and all the useful

859
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,800
tools that came with big tech they'll

860
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,040
just have to disappear again no it's

861
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
about scale you know it's about these

862
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,400
huge skill networks that can spin a lie

863
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,720
into a truth no one shall ever have the

864
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,480
power again to twist our shared

865
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,319
knowledge so

866
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,560
no huge skill networks okay so no

867
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,839
wikipedia

868
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,560
of course wikipedia is wikipedia why

869
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
it's it's it's nice it's it's it's

870
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
democratic it's it's everything on it is

871
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,880
a hundred percent true

872
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,079
a hundred percent 100

873
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,319
fine

874
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,760
we need some

875
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,839
big networks okay some

876
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,920
so like the doctor who forum you are oh

877
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,200
i love that right yeah and it can just

878
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,359
exist yeah right i mean it needs a

879
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
little moderation of course

880
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,560
even

881
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,079
of course even the doctor who forum

882
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,440
needs a little moderation i mean you

883
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,720
really don't want to know how heated

884
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,160
conversations about british science

885
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,319
fiction can get

886
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,760
right

887
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
point is

888
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,800
we want some networks

889
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,119
some big networks

890
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,520
also scaled networks yeah but with

891
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
moderation yeah great so who makes the

892
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
rules huh who decides who can see and

893
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,400
say what

894
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,880
the state yeah china seems to have been

895
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
thinking about that russia too oh that's

896
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
so easy a little moderation and

897
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,160
accidental stalin did you know that in

898
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,760
china they have a tick tock limit for

899
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,599
teenagers they can only use the app for

900
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
two hours per day that's sweet yeah it's

901
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
sweet but it's also a state controlled

902
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,480
limit with an extra dose of censorship

903
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,119
sauce man

904
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,640
it's about the forces behind the exploit

905
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,560
of our data you know it's the the

906
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,200
capitalism the hunger for growth the

907
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,560
privatization of every transaction

908
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,760
data companies with malicious intent

909
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,400
okay okay so then uh overtime

910
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
what about albert einstein then overtime

911
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
is big tech

912
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,240
you mean the vastly superior interface

913
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
design of the self-skin casa oh you that

914
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
people are so proud of yourself

915
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,359
the bonus cards right

916
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,960
they use it to track your groceries and

917
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,200
they build a profile out of you since

918
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,720
negri says

919
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,359
and that's way before mark even set foot

920
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,839
in his dorm room and they use that

921
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,359
dataset set to predict to adapt to gain

922
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
commercially you know think how large

923
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
that data set is

924
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,760
okay but

925
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,680
i mean if

926
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
if you could go back in time

927
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,440
and kill albert hein as a baby would you

928
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,760
do it

929
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,599
you want chaos

930
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,760
but not freedom right you want the

931
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,079
growth but also want to decide what is

932
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,480
good to grow you want information but to

933
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,640
control the flow of it you want the

934
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
comfort of yourself skin casa but not

935
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
the consumerism that drives innovation

936
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,079
and you you idealize this this ancient

937
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,079
version of the internet that was full of

938
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,040
the same as now just less visible

939
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,599
and you you deny that over the past 20

940
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,920
years this this whole parade has gotten

941
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,720
so

942
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,520
interwoven with our with our daily lives

943
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,000
cars homes and interactions that to rip

944
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,119
it out

945
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,480
would be like

946
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,359
tearing up the veins from your own body

947
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,520
you know so you just step back into

948
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,119
false nostalgia

949
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,520
for a time that never even existed and

950
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,680
you blame big tech for what

951
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
everything right because somehow they

952
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,640
all did it it's all the data harder's

953
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
fault if we could just control it if we

954
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,440
could have the chaos and control it it's

955
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,839
a paradox

956
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,359
it has

957
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,280
it has no basis in reality

958
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,720
to be honest it terrifies me

959
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,839
this

960
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,520
that's not changing the direction of a

961
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
wave man

962
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,400
stepping back

963
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,520
okay okay so so

964
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,760
maybe we drew the wrong conclusion

965
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,200
can we

966
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
decrucify

come people

970
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,119
try again

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,200
try better

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,800
let's see who we

973
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,280
judge this time

974
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,310

the court is once again my guest

well here at big tech you know we

987
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,000
we know we aren't perfect but we try

988
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
we get pretty darn close

989
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,839
haven't we been helpful so far yes

you're helpful but what do you have to

991
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,920
say about all those problems that you

992
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
caused

993
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,800
yeah i mean the growing pains

the kinks and the cable

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,440
do you think johan gutenberg immediately

996
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,040
built his printing press in the most

997

optimized way

998
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,960

something awesome

1001
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,599
just have some patience and let the tech

catch up with our intentions people of

just misunderstand big tech

can they shift the blame

i request another witness

1086
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,359
the megastar philosophy himself needs to

1087
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,040
be heard

1088
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,960

right infinite complexity worlds within

1097
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,480
wow there we go

1098
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
it seems tempting to just want to

1099
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,839
control the madness of it all right to

1100
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,160
put laws and rules into place that

1101
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,880
decide who can see and say what in this

1102

[Music]

1105
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,559
so you look at technology and you say

1106
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,480
that's the thing

1107
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,920
but you forget

1108
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,880
that tech is just the thing that gets

1109
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,160
you to the thing and behind the thing

1110
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,920
it's just us

1111
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,559
you know i'm from a land of olive stone

1112
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
and lime yards and i say

1113
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,200
cut out the middle thing man

1114
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,720
just step over these tools you use and

1115
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,319
become

1116
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,040
things loving things again

1117
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,460
such wise words from our friends

1119
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,400

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,720
people of the jury

1121
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,880
having heard these words it is time to

1122
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,839
decide with who's to hang and who's to

1123
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,800
abide let's get that bronze ground in

1124
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,119
here wait a minute

1125
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,559
carla just told me that you

1126
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,200
use all our truth telling

1127
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,000
to make money you turn our hard work

1128
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,440
into ad revenue

1129
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,920
we need to make money corey to spread

1130
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,680
the truth

1131
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,920
you don't care about the truth you only

1132
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,760
care about the profits

1133
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,319
how do you expect us to pay our rent we

1134
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,880
need to make money too corey and this is

1135
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,079
how we all decided to use the thing to

1136
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,440
make money

1137
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,280
sorry you got a little gloss there

1138
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,520
connie we were just trying our best for

1139
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,559
you and for us but mostly for you so you

1140
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,760
know maybe maybe it's not us you need to

1141
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,880
get rid of

1142
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,640
maybe it's technology itself

1143
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,440
yeah

1144
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,800
yes

1145
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,520
it's

1146
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,599
it's technology's fault it's

1147
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,599
tech's fault you did nothing wrong mr

1148
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,559
big tech

1149
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,119
i knew it was the technology all along i

1150
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,200
knew it because

1151
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,520
why do i always ask a question about

1152
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,400
anything and the answer always seems to

1153
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,599
be

1154
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,640
oh it's the bad nature of humans but we

1155
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
are not the bad thing here

1156
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,520
when i was a kid i was thought we could

1157
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,280
achieve anything

1158
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,599

but we are not made to use the power of

1164
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,160
the gods and if the tech gets in the way

1165
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,680
i say crucify you technology sorry i

1166
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,040
really don't know if that is the way

1167
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,800

1169
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,960

1170
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,359

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,200
between the things man

1172
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,680
you can cut it out we've always survived

1173
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,920
you see we're not bound to technology

1174
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,599
we're just bound to your hard-earned

1175

yeah no it's a bit weird isn't it right

1223
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,720
to draw a line in the sand and say this

1224
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,720
is what's human this is what's nature

1225
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,720
and the rest isn't

1226
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,400
even though the whole thing sprung from

1227
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,880
our own brains you know isn't it just

1228
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,200
rearrangement of energy just taking what

1229
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,559
was already there

1230
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:13,280
why

1231
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,680
why do we feel this need to

1232
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,520
differentiate

1233
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,280
isn't that just an admission of weakness

1234
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,079
i mean

1235
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,000
it's not like technology is some sort of

1236
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,960
entity right it's it's an ongoing

1237
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,079
process

1238
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,480
it's a conversation it's it's a piece of
