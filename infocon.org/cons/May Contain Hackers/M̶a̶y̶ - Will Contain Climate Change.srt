2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,720
right hi everyone welcome back to

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
the clairvoyance stage

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
at mch 2022 i'm very happy to

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,400
well actually i'm slightly depressed to

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
it's the topic to introduce igor to talk

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
about uh what may what will happen with

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
with climate change so

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,600
eagle thank you

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,000
thank you very much

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,719
thank you all very much for coming this

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,719
is of course the um

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
i am the thing standing between you and

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
beer and chunk

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
and i very much appreciate your presence

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,640
so i know it's a graveyard shift um for

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,399
your convenience and you can leave after

18
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
this it's fine tldr as every good

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,039
presentation should have

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,360
um this is a part of a series that has

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
been developing as my own thinking about

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
this topic develops

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,840
this was the first

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,000
one oops

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
quite literally

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,439
and then as time went on and this is the

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,080
a few years later in the next balkan we

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
are actually having a system

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,000
being rooted by forces we do not want

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,479
and that's not good and then of course

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
it gets

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,439
worse

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,680
and i am very sorry to have probably the

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
most depressing talk of

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
mch but the idea is better to be

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,439
prepared and better than to act as if

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
it's not there so uh let's not reboot

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
the system even though the data center

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
might want to do that

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
so welcome to may slash will

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
contain climate change my name is igor

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
nikolic i'm an associate professor at

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
university of delft but that's not the

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
important part

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,159
the important part i'm a nerd just like

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,360
all of us here

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
um i'm a neurodiverse dad uh wannabe

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
artist hobby blacksmith

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,599
i have two little angels

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
no they're smelly teenagers but they do

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
drive around trash which is good

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
i make stuff i like to talk about about

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
these things and um

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,200
yeah so that's me um i've been studying

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,239
sustainable development for my entire

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
adult life

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
and i'm not happier for it but it's

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,879
important and i want to share the things

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
that i know and especially what do we do

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
about these things

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
right um

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
ask questions there is a deal there is a

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
man man page do ask questions please

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
keep it to clarifications because of the

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
limited time there is a village called

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
emergent earth claudia can you wave

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
together with claudia yeah we are

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
organizing

69
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
a village which is a separate track

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
to talk about these topics come to see

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
us

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
it is on the far

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
right of the program not of anything

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,319
else

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,080
so scroll the program you'll see it on

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,879
i'll show you in a second yeah okay so

77
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
um it's okay to leave if it's too much i

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
will not be upset

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
well well just a little bit

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
what are we gonna do uh three things

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
three main things first i want to talk

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
about science i will throw facts and

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
citations at you just to show where are

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
we what's going on to the best of my

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
knowledge i'm not a climate scientist

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
i'm a modeler i build uh study

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
sustainable systems the transitions of

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
industrial and things like that

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
but i do know my science so this is what

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
we know for fact that will be part one

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
part two will be informed guess work

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
right a hypothesis things that i expect

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
based on everything i know part three

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
will be designed what do we do

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
about this stuff as a bunch of nerds

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,640
and we can do more than you think and

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
then there is a bit of hope

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
because it's so sad to leave you with a

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
sad story so we'll try our best so

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
context and a bit of theory science

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,959
starting

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
um i want to introduce you to a couple

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,640
of concepts before we dive in so it

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
makes conversation easy the first

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
concept i would like to share with you

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
is the notion of a wicked problem

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
right a wicked problem is a technical

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,040
term

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,798
the citation is on the bottom you can

110
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,880
find it really nice paper

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
if you cannot download it there is this

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,280
website called scihob

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
i'm sure they have it

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
so what are wicked problems we got

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
problems or problems that do not have a

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
definite problem formulation it's kind

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
of like let's organize a hacker event

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
what does that mean right there's no

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
clear problem

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
it's impossible to measure claim success

121
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
we solved climate change

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
we solved hacker camps i don't know

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
sir

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
solutions can only be good or bad not

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
true or false there is no

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
right or wrong in a wicked problem there

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
is it kind of works but it's meh

128
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,280
right there's usually no perfect

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
solution you can't optimize your way out

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
of a wicked problem

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
there's always more than one reason why

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
things are the way they are and there's

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
always multiple solutions to these

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,039
things

135
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
and whenever you see a problem you see a

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
symptom it usually is a symptom of

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
something else and it's it's kind of

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
meatballs and spaghetti right it's all

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,880
kind of connected and

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
objective scientific solutions are

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
impossible and i do not use the word

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
lightly impossible

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,479
right

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
uh it is all about values and norms

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
because what is a good world to live in

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,919
well i might think there's a certain way

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,039
that's that's good but maybe you

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,800
disagree so but it's still the same

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
world so how do we right

150
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,919
um

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
solutions are one shot you got one try

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and then that's it you up forever

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,960
right

154
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,799
and you cannot afford to be wrong

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
right you cannot make a mistake

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
you must act you know that you don't

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,360
know

158
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,319
good luck

159
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
right if this was a cartoon series it

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
would be really funny except it's

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
the sustainability problem the climate

162
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
change problem the whole transition

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,160
problem of human species where do we go

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
into the future how is it even going to

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,120
look like

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
who's right the elon musks and we should

167
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
all go to mars and be his slaves

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
or the chinese government or what i mean

169
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,880
i don't know

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
then so that's one bit of theory the

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,759
other bit of theory i want to talk to

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,720
you about is chaos

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
right and chaos is ridiculously

174
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
misunderstood which is always fun

175
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,039
chaos means

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,400
chaos occurs

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
chaotic systems are systems that are

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
iterative things that repeat what they

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
do economy is chaotic because you trade

180
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,479
and then you trade again then you go buy

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
bread again and you buy bread again and

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
it's these repeated actions that

183
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
characterize the systems they have they

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
are path dependent so history matters

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
where you come from determines where you

186
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
can go

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,240
okay

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
and they're very sensitive to initial

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,639
conditions the famous butterfly

190
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
right so the red

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
blob there is the lawrence butterfly

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
this is a set of differential equations

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
i can give you three lectures on this

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
which i won't

195
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,440
but this is how the differential

196
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
equations that has

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
unique properties namely

198
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
the

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,680
small oh my image is overlapping that's

200
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
not good tiny impact small changes in

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,479
variables can have very large effects on

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
the system's behavior

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
but inverse is also true

204
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,400
massive changes to the inputs

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
can produce no effect

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
so you can have butterflies flapping

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,759
their wings

208
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
and causing tornadoes which is because

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
this is a weather system that's how it

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
started right that's a model or weather

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
but you could also have a 747 try to

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,800
land in the middle of field and not a

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
single little

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
tent moves

215
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
that's what chaotic systems are they

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,120
have these characteristic structures

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,639
they're stuck in what's technically

218
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
called an attractor

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,120
and

220
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
attractors are a pain in the ass

221
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
right nasa uses attractors in this

222
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
chaotic orbits you shoot in rocket you

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
have this unstable orbit and at some

224
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,520
point you give it a push and it flips

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
over the orbit around the moon

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
let me demonstrate

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
i will show you an outcome of a

228
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,639
simulation this is no climate this is a

229
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,240
so-called predator prey system the lord

230
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
cavotera an agent-based model over there

231
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
wolf sheep grass

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
energy comes in grass grows

233
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,319
sheep run around eat grass make more

234
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,039
sheep wolves run around eat sheep make

235
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,759
more wolves that's it

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,360
that dynamics is what i'm going to show

237
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
you

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
what am i doing here i am changing

239
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
in the simulation the speed at which the

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,599
grass grows back

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
so i'm adding energy into the system i'm

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
feeding the system by increasing the

243
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
grass grows faster and faster

244
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
this is a state diagram

245
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
showing you the relationships of the

246
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
number of sheep

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
number of wolves and the amount of grass

248
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
makes sense

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
now what do you observe you observe a

250
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,600
dynamic system it's oscillating

251
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
it's sp

252
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
wolves go up ground shapes sheep go down

253
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
grass goes up wolves go up and down

254
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
but as i'm adding energy something weird

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
is happening it's oscillating

256
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
more and more heavily but it's still in

257
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
the same corner

258
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,319
until

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
oh sheep world

260
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
wolves have died out

261
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
there's no more grass there's only sheep

262
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,959
and as soon as grass grows up sheep eat

263
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
it and they grow more sheep and that's

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
it

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
did you see how it happened

266
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,800
oscillate oscillate it's still the same

267
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
thing still the same thing oh

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
you see the path you see the history it

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
cannot just go there and it has to

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
follow a path together

271
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,399
right and this is what you need to

272
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,760
understand when you think about climate

273
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
change or any sustainability discussion

274
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
it's path dependent it's chaotic it's

275
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
slow insensitive to change until it hits

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
you in the face and then you're screwed

277
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
make sense

278
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,519
okay basic chaos theory

279
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
and now watch this

280
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
paper in nature climate change

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
this is the jet stream right you know

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,600
about the jet stream it's a wind that's

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
spinning around the poles

284
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
and it's a chaotic system it's a wind so

285
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,760
it's coming from somewhere it's going

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,959
somewhere and it is being fed by more

287
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,640
heat

288
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
planet is warming up co2 you know all of

289
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
that right is more energy in the system

290
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
and what is it doing it is flip-flopping

291
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
more and more and more and more

292
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,839
it's always messy right chaotic systems

293
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,200
are always messy they're never quite

294
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
stable but they're roughly the pattern

295
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,079
remains

296
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,279
now watch those big loops appearing it's

297
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,120
like holy what's going on why is it

298
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
suddenly 30 celsius in the north

299
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,399
pole

300
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
that's not supposed to happen

301
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
well it's because hot air happened to

302
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
just

303
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
because it has more energy it's

304
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,279
flip-flopping is flying off into places

305
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
it shouldn't be flying off to

306
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
does that make sense

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
right so this is literally

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
copy paste chaotic systems

309
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
probably the most depressing plot ever

310
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,160
deviation of average temperature

311
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
over time

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
zero minus one plus one about long term

313
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
averages right and i'm sure you've seen

314
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,959
this it was all over twitter

315
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
and this is what 1930s so nothing is

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
happening realize we have we had our

317
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
first world war we are having second

318
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
world war we are having massive

319
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
industrialization we are building

320
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
factories we are making trains power

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
plants building all these things

322
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
and it's all fine ish

323
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
70s

324
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
70s people around yeah there we go

325
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,519
and that's of course when it started

326
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
going downhill it's overall full time

327
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
sorry vesna

328
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
but whoa wait

329
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,639
there is

330
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
again remember chaotic systems they are

331
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
roughly somewhere never exactly there

332
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,800
but roughly around that area but

333
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
suddenly

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
something is pushing us

335
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
somewhere and some were probably not

336
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,959
very good

337
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
now if you turn this around you see that

338
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
we are getting there and we also watch

339
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
40 or 100 years of delay we've been

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
pumping co2 and mining coal since the

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
industrial revolution not as fast as now

342
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
but increasingly and it takes a while

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
there's that delay effect of complex

344
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,760
systems of chaotic systems it takes a

345
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
while while they do their thing but once

346
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
they do

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,040
oh

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
you don't stop a tanker right if you

349
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
know big ships tankers if they want to

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
break they need 25 to 30 kilometers to

351
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
stop

352
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
so you could like hit the brakes but no

353
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
so okay we're this is no fun

354
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
to make even more depressed this is the

355
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,599
recent ipcc report just came out

356
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
okay so we are not in a good place

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,079
people this is not good we are there is

358
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,480
your simulated natural if you only had

359
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
solar volcanic you know when the climate

360
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,240
change and errors go no but it's the sun

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,880
no it's not the sun yes it has an effect

362
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
of course it's oscillating but you don't

363
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,959
get that

364
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
and we do get that

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
i mean

366
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,800
this xkcd who doesn't love it right you

367
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,399
i'm sure you've seen this one that's the

368
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
historic timeline for past 200 million

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
years or something-ish

370
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
line never comes into red

371
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
until

372
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,519
2016.

373
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,760
this is not natural we are a step

374
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
function right i'm sure there's lots of

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
signals people here you know what

376
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
happens when you just drop the voltage

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
from zero to five bomb

378
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
nothing like that that's like holy cow

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
weather doesn't like that we are

380
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
in a very interesting situation this is

381
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,480
not

382
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
just history oh but it has been hot in

383
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
the past of course it has

384
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
several 100

385
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
million years ago yes we did have you

386
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
know 50 million years ago we had 700 900

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
ppm co2

388
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,399
that's how the road looked like

389
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
okay we are now hitting what is it 470

390
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
ish slowly 450 460.

391
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
basically amsterdam

392
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,680
beatside property right i hope you own a

393
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,839
boat

394
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
asia southeast asia nope

395
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
right

396
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
there is a and our economist god bless

397
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
any economist in the rooms

398
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
anybody be upset no so the person who

399
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
got the nobel prize for economics

400
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,279
and i will try not to swear has

401
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
calculated that the optimal global

402
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
warming for the economy is 14.7 degrees

403
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,399
celsius not the 0.7

404
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
last time this planet had 14

405
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
celsius average higher temperature there

406
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
were palm trees of green land

407
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
you tell me that's optimal good luck

408
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,240
you're in trouble but they got the

409
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
nobles so must be right

410
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
i was not going to swear anyway

411
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
economist thank you spent new classical

412
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,720
economies there's lots of sane economies

413
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,079
don't get me wrong

414
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,959
so we are in an interesting situation so

415
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,240
this is where i want to stop the science

416
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,360
because we can rant about this for a

417
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,680
long time but hope you all know this

418
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
what are what does this mean because

419
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,959
here you can look at numbers you can

420
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
look at the scary maps but now what

421
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,880
well

422
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,959
changes in impacts the first thing is

423
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,279
even if we stop now remember the chaotic

424
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
attractor remember the tanker

425
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
even if we stop now it will take

426
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
geological time scales to have that

427
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
carbon removed

428
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,000
i want you to just think about what a

429
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
geological time scale means

430
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
humanity in its current form has existed

431
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,680
between 200 000 to 2 million years at

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
best

433
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,160
geologists count in mega years as the

434
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
smallest unit

435
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,839
right so

436
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
the time that you can expect the co2 to

437
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
drop naturally will be longer than

438
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
humanity has ever existed

439
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
aka do not think as this summer as the

440
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
hottest of your life think about it as

441
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,759
the coldest

442
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,880
summer of your future

443
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
now this keeps me over awake at night i

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,839
have to

445
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
this no

446
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
that's what we know

447
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
impacts there's things we know gonna

448
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
happen i mix those in i'm gonna talk a

449
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
little bit just mention a few things

450
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
that i know that we don't know and

451
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
there's lots of things we have no idea

452
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
about right the famous rumsfield unknown

453
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
unknowns

454
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,639
these changes will be

455
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,399
sudden and of course i forgot to start

456
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
start my timer

457
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
they will be sudden

458
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,880
but they will also be gradual both

459
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
things will happen systems react at

460
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
different times some some systems react

461
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
really quickly some will take a while to

462
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
develop there will be ad hoc sudden

463
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
things that don't repeat and there will

464
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
be systemic changes

465
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
let's unpack this just various

466
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
categories to give us some flavor

467
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
ecological

468
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,519
much more frequent much more extreme

469
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,959
weather

470
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,480
think about the shittiest kind of

471
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
weather you have where you live is

472
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
different for all of us for me in

473
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
holland this will be storms more storms

474
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
shittier storms it will be heat waves

475
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
more rain

476
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
just more again remember the oscillating

477
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
wolves and sheep it's just gonna be that

478
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
but quicker

479
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
and more extreme yeah

480
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,160
snow droughts you know anything

481
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
ecosystems will be out of back many

482
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,599
species cannot adapt

483
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,959
i do want to point out nature the planet

484
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,599
life on earth is fine

485
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,039
life on earth doesn't give a about

486
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
humans humans are not going to be fine

487
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
there will be life we will not kill life

488
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
i cannot imagine the scenario where

489
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
humanity kills life on this planet

490
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
lots of scenarios where humanity kills

491
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
itself

492
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,799
right so life will be i mean geological

493
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,880
time skills right in few million years

494
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
whatever bacteria will involve

495
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
consciousness and cockroaches get to

496
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
rule the world it's going to be fine

497
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
life wise

498
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
not humanity-wise pollination

499
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,840
80 decreased there was a big study in

500
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
germany recently they counted bugs 70 to

501
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
80 percent of the bugs are gone

502
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,679
thank you buyer and monsanto and

503
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
neonicotinites and temperature changes

504
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
oops bees go we go you know yeah arable

505
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
land loss carbon capture going down we

506
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
cannot capture so much co2 anymore

507
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
methane right you know that stuff

508
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
permafrost melting moment the permafrost

509
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
melts

510
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
all that biomass starts to rot

511
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,080
methane comes up methane is 20 or 20

512
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,320
20 times worse than co2 in terms of

513
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
global warming potential

514
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
runaways

515
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
non-linearities flip-flopping into the

516
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,760
next state

517
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,039
joy

518
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,840
there's a ph there's a with the phd the

519
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
ph of the oceans hits critical

520
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
temperature all

521
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
bacteria all um um plankton will start

522
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,200
dissolving

523
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
just literally chemically will dissolve

524
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
80 percent of our oxygen comes from them

525
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,919
if you're not there i mean it's going to

526
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
take a while but

527
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,120
economic increase in equality i don't

528
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,160
need to tell you about that you know

529
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
what kind of world we live in

530
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
political instability we've seen it

531
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,880
right we've seen um the arab spring the

532
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,679
price of grain triggers social unrest

533
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,799
triggers other things trigger

534
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,600
speculation food prices energy prices

535
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
you know i'm sure you've seen your

536
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,799
twisted bill recently

537
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,240
decreasing in earning potential you

538
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
might not be able to make so much money

539
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
europe service oriented who's going to

540
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,840
need services if you need to

541
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,440
eat on availability of products and raw

542
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
materials right they ever given

543
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
there was a lot of very nasty jokes and

544
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,360
memes i could have put up but i didn't

545
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
but yeah ima you remember that one how

546
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,280
much that affected everything

547
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,799
now imagine if it's serious that

548
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,960
seriously starts getting disrupted

549
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
logistics change all of that that's

550
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,799
going to be interesting and of course

551
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
for each and one of us the effects will

552
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,160
be different

553
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,840
at individual level but systematically

554
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
these are the things we're looking at

555
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,679
financial oh it's against the one

556
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,480
percent realize we are the one percent

557
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
you would not be here if you're not that

558
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,360
doesn't feel like it especially if

559
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
you're a young student or you have no

560
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,159
income you're like what the i'm not

561
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,679
rich globally you're well off right here

562
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
is the income distribution we are

563
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,200
talking about the

564
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
when you talk about one percent you're

565
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
thinking about the top 100

566
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,720
people the top 1000 people in that own

567
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,520
so there's that um financial markets are

568
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
volatile because they're moving quickly

569
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
across the planet they're trying to seek

570
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
interest looking for stability moving

571
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
around causing instability because of

572
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
that

573
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,960
right

574
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
property boom bus cycles we know all of

575
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,080
that so suddenly you bought all this

576
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,679
fancy property for lots of money and now

577
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
it's flooded oh who's gonna buy it

578
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,480
nobody if you own property in florida

579
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
sell now

580
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
right you cannot build dikes around

581
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,600
florida because of the porous limestone

582
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,880
so you can build a deck water comes

583
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
under and you're done

584
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
so it's when the gaming bodies are from

585
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,840
florida and it's always really fun when

586
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
talking about this

587
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
um

588
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
yeah oh but of course energy transition

589
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
and sustainability is way too expensive

590
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
we can't afford that because we just

591
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
spent trillions of dollars on wars

592
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
but hey you know

593
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,799
priorities

594
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
social um

595
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,919
my god

596
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
if you think uh the hate for foreigners

597
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
and immigrants is bad

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,400
imagine 150 million bangladeshis having

599
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,919
no home

600
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,440
just one of the many countries at the

601
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,000
extreme risk of flooding

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,799
right 41 of the 163 million live under

603
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,159
10 meters

604
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
poor country limited ability to organize

605
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,080
and get built it's a delta so it's gone

606
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,400
water both sides and then suddenly you

607
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
know netherlands is in panic because few

608
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
hundred thousand people from syria want

609
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
to come in imagine few hundred million

610
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,640
standing on the borders this is gonna

611
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,080
happen

612
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
how are we gonna deal with it

613
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,360
well i have a

614
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,559
hint

615
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
aging population when you're old you're

616
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,159
naturally more conservative because old

617
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,679
people are just conservative because

618
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,960
they have more history to protect them

619
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
future to build right we have almost no

620
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
less and less babies so who cares

621
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
i'm obviously exaggerating but you get

622
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
it right

623
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
fear uncertainty alzheimer

624
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,200
because that's all people get that i

625
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,559
mean you know

626
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
so you're gonna end up voting more

627
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,320
conservatives yeah less

628
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,840
more religious all of when people are

629
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,440
afraid basic psychological mechanisms

630
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,600
are grab the things you know

631
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,679
right security what do you know your

632
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,039
race your your religion your nation

633
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,840
me us not them

634
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,679
right humans don't work at scale of 6

635
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
billion people humans work at scale of

636
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,080
150 to 200 people a village we have

637
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
villages here right because that's us

638
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
not them

639
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,520
not because we're bad but that's just

640
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,400
human minds and of course we have

641
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
20 30 years of neoliberal

642
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,480
because markets are amazing and markets

643
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,919
are going to fix everything and just

644
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
let's make corporations people and all

645
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,399
of that

646
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
okay

647
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,760
good so technological uh what can you

648
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
expect look at refugee camps for your

649
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
future

650
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
go to crete being a refugee camp you

651
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
want to eat you give up your biometrics

652
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,159
you don't want that fine you go hungry

653
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,480
right retinol scans get food

654
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
imagine that being standard operating

655
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
procedure in a supermarket

656
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
but my privacy oh i don't care you want

657
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
to eat

658
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
again it's a

659
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
long but in a world where there's

660
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
limited supply

661
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
governments honestly trying to

662
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
be you know good and try to give

663
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,480
everybody something we'll have to

664
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
control

665
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
you're going to have to end up something

666
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,678
extreme

667
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,840
reduced access to limitations and

668
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
criminalizations of information of

669
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
technology because again

670
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
if you're an honest government you're

671
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,400
trying to control you're not being even

672
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
evil but you end up doing very evil

673
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,559
things because of that

674
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,559
in pockets you're gonna have high tech

675
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
right i mean

676
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
i really don't like how much

677
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
fallout and i'm sure there's people who

678
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
played fallout game or cyberpunk

679
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,960
they're like yeah that you know that's

680
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
actually not too crazy

681
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
that makes sense it's it's a logical

682
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,960
conclusion of what is going on because

683
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
again changes because the path dependent

684
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
systems we have these histories you

685
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
cannot just change

686
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
you cannot just oh let's do everything

687
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
decentralized energy yes and then

688
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,080
several million kilometers of existing

689
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
power lines they're gonna just disappear

690
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
of course not

691
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,720
energy increasing prices of energy

692
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
storage capacity fuels all of that

693
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
lithium is running scarce

694
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
oil we know about that

695
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,200
stability of supply is always a problem

696
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
stability of distribution

697
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,240
i i mean it was sad but funny that image

698
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
is from a few days back

699
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
people were hosing down bridges in

700
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,279
amsterdam because they were buckling

701
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,960
from the heat they were not designed for

702
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,400
this

703
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
no bridge anywhere in northwestern

704
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,080
europe or most of europe is designed to

705
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
ex to have this kind of heat

706
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,960
there is only so much hoses

707
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
right and this is just one example so

708
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,039
imagine things cascadingly going

709
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
up because it's over everywhere all the

710
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
time you can't deal i work a lot with

711
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,039
power companies with my research and my

712
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,120
studies and my models this is a quote i

713
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
don't want to put a name there about a

714
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
major company building major

715
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,880
infrastructure sure i can give you 380

716
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,360
kilowatt lines give me 10 years

717
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,679
seven years of permits and maybe i can

718
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,440
buy enough copper and maybe i have

719
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,159
enough people to build them

720
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
rapid transition no

721
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
because it's expensive slow it's big

722
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
it's ill-organized and hard

723
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,600
one does not just

724
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
waltz into

725
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,799
energy transition one slowly builds it

726
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
over time

727
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
time don't have

728
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
transport

729
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
you might not be able to travel i'm born

730
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,799
in a

731
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,880
country that has had war i know how hard

732
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
it is to leave a country

733
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,159
right try entering a country but they

734
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,640
don't want you there

735
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
yes but my country's flooded and

736
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,320
not my problem buddy off

737
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,640
yes but yes but i am important no you're

738
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
not

739
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,559
again not a friendly thing but strike

740
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,559
being

741
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
black muslim female leaving syria

742
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,720
because they bombed your house and

743
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,480
sitting in greek camp

744
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
that's the reality you might have to

745
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,000
live with at some point you or your kids

746
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
i do have kids before you ask so yes i'm

747
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,919
worried uh where the disruptions you

748
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
know all of this is going to be very

749
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,159
interesting

750
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,960
medicine same thing amazing things are

751
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
coming there is um expectations that

752
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
first humans are born who will live to

753
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,520
be routinely 120 or 130 years old

754
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
imagine that population of ever growing

755
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
people

756
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
never it's going to be a mess

757
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,600
a lot of biodiversity we get lots of

758
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,400
drugs from nature we're killing that

759
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
supply chains right i had a panic about

760
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
a year back when suddenly my pills were

761
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
not available if i stop i'm in trouble

762
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
so how do i do this because what's

763
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
too bad let's go go crazy

764
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,520
right

765
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,200
um antibiotic resistance all of those

766
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
things are fun um

767
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
but okay so these are the things that we

768
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,559
need to

769
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,480
understand because if we are going to do

770
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
something about it or be prepared one

771
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,039
needs to know the attack surfaces what

772
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
is the stuff that's going to affect us

773
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
so we can start preparing

774
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
right and i think many of you do infosec

775
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
you do the same thing what is my apts

776
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,279
what am i building against

777
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,200
so some strategies

778
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,480
um

779
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
everything i want to say here make sense

780
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
within what i understand is context to

781
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
me this might not work for you

782
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,399
because a different person different

783
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,720
history who you are where you are when

784
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,399
you are so take it with a grain of salt

785
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
but think about those big drivers i

786
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
mentioned and think about how that means

787
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
to you

788
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
so there's a bunch of useless stuff

789
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,919
that's out there that's very popular

790
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,520
standard prepping i'm gonna have

791
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
gazillion bullets and i'm gonna have

792
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,799
lots of cans right and then

793
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,399
just no

794
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,760
just no

795
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,120
um

796
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,039
hoarding inner wood strategies

797
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,159
especially if european which would where

798
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,240
you and 17 gajillion other people around

799
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
you of course not maybe it works if

800
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
you're but not here

801
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,720
so paranoia panic no useless you just

802
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
got to be prepared not panicked

803
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
but of course disaster preparedness

804
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,720
makes perfect sense

805
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
right if you live in the place you know

806
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
you you're likely to hit be hit by a

807
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
flood or you're gonna have storms you

808
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,200
better be prepared that would be stupid

809
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,399
not to

810
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,240
which depends on where you are what it

811
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
is

812
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,799
so i'll just leave no you will not

813
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,480
you will not leave you will not be able

814
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
to leave even if you want to you will

815
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
not be welcome anywhere a world that is

816
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
disrupted at this level will not be able

817
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,600
to

818
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,480
be gentle and friendly

819
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
right

820
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,039
especially if you're not

821
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
you know slightly be slightly different

822
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,159
than your average middle-aged white male

823
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,760
because that's unfortunately the fact of

824
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
what we live in so you know think about

825
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,279
it

826
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,320
what is useful well this

827
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,840
and i do not say that lightly i do

828
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
believe these are the kinds of events

829
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,440
that give me hope in humanity because we

830
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
can pull this off with bunch of

831
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
dedicated focused people

832
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
so find them

833
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,799
they're open things learn how thing if

834
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,159
you don't hack it you don't own it we

835
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,600
know that

836
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,840
right

837
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,200
you know how the i don't know if you

838
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
caught that um

839
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
russians were stealing ukrainian farming

840
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,000
equipment for whatever and then oh look

841
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
at us being so cool then john deere has

842
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,080
disabled now now stolen russian

843
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,880
equipment look win for john deere

844
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,440
wait so they just turned them off

845
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
for the russians in this case but when

846
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,440
they're gonna turn them off for me

847
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,880
then they feel like it how does that

848
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
then well wait

849
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
critical what is really going on we live

850
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
in the world of this information we know

851
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
that

852
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,240
verify

853
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,159
trust but verify but it's really really

854
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,039
takes time follow money

855
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
you know follow the dark money try

856
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
that's that's the kind of stuff you can

857
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
do as nerds you know how to process

858
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,640
information

859
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,240
find it track it

860
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,399
expose it

861
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,960
follow the power lines who is

862
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
influencing what and be creative it's

863
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,520
improvisation it is repair it is making

864
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
do learn to live with less because

865
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
that's always good right consume less

866
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,559
resources emit less co2

867
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,840
be used to being

868
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
poor we're not really poor most of us

869
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
are not

870
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,399
not in the i'm living in the dirt i have

871
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,960
nothing to eat poor again plenty people

872
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
are but we're not

873
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
get into the

874
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,840
mindset of not having things what does

875
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
that mean do you need to own something

876
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,279
new can you just you know

877
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,480
ninety percent of my furniture's

878
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,600
recycled

879
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
just because that's fun it's just

880
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,159
cheaper

881
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,720
why should i waste money but many people

882
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
don't think that because you need every

883
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
three years you're furnishing your house

884
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,720
don't you

885
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
i mean i know people who just do that

886
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,279
every three years everything goes to the

887
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,000
trash buy new stuff

888
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,440
okay fine

889
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,840
value creation what makes value

890
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
can you make value without having a

891
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
proprietary

892
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,760
big question right we open source has

893
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,399
shown the world that that's possible can

894
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,840
you do that with things that are capital

895
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,919
intensive that's more difficult if you

896
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,519
need to own machines if you need to own

897
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,120
mines or if you need to have you know

898
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
how does that work i don't know let's

899
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
find out

900
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,360
can you make low tech that's useful

901
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
right these are all challenges for us

902
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,840
can you be creative with something

903
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,559
that's easy to make but very powerful

904
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
communicate and educate

905
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,919
here we are

906
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,640
talk to people talk to

907
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,120
friends and family who are maybe on the

908
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,559
confused side

909
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,919
show them

910
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,360
especially communication a lot of the

911
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
environmental movement has up

912
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
because they talk about polar bears and

913
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
pandas pandas talk people about the

914
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
grandchildren

915
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,760
no don't actually pandas that

916
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
they're protected animals but the the

917
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,799
the message has been traditionally oh my

918
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,640
god do it for the environment no

919
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,000
that's wrong

920
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
do it for you

921
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,519
because that that gets people going

922
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,799
because that's what people care about

923
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
abstract pandas are for the very few

924
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,399
select people who can afford to think

925
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,760
about pandas

926
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
most people cannot afford not to think

927
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,679
about the grandkids

928
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,799
right

929
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
organize

930
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
it really doesn't matter what you do as

931
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,120
long as you're getting organized

932
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,279
go into politics if you have the stomach

933
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,480
for it

934
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
be there show up step up

935
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
because you have clue and you can at

936
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,559
least do the less bad thing

937
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,240
because there is no best thing remember

938
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,840
wicked problems it's going to be

939
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,360
anyway how can we make it less

940
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
you want to be able to do usual

941
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
emergency response skills awareness

942
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
first aid all these basic things that

943
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,640
make you a better human

944
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,120
they will help

945
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,279
and leadership i want to i don't

946
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,760
can you turn me on because that's not

947
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,240
audible

948
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
this is worth watching it's short but i

949
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
think it's a really good message here

950
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,320
even though ted meh

951
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
so ladies and gentlemen at ted we talk a

952
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,399
lot about leadership and how to make a

953
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,399
movement so let's watch a movement

954
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
happen start to finish in under three

955
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,799
minutes and dissect some lessons from it

956
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,799
first of course you know a leader needs

957
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,360
the guts to stand out and be ridiculed

958
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
but what he's doing is so easy to follow

959
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,720
so here's his first follower with a

960
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
crucial role he's going to show everyone

961
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
else how to follow now notice that the

962
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,960
leader embraces him as an equal so now

963
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,640
it's not about the leader anymore it's

964
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,799
about them plural now there he is

965
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,960
calling to his friends now if you notice

966
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
that the first follower is actually an

967
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,039
underestimated form of leadership in

968
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,320
itself takes guts to stand out like that

969
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,799
the first follower is what transforms a

970
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,559
lone nut into a leader

971
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,399
and here comes a second follower now

972
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,320
it's not a lone nut it's not two nuts

973
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,880
three is a crowd and the crowd is news

974
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
so a movement must be public it's

975
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
important to show not just the leader

976
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
but the followers because you find that

977
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,600
new followers emulate the followers not

978
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,799
the leader

979
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,159
now here come two more people and

980
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,440
immediately after

981
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
three more people now we've got momentum

982
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,839
this is the tipping point now we've got

983
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,480
a movement

984
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,520
so

985
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,359
notice that as more people join in it's

986
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,359
less risky so those that were sitting on

987
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
the fence before now have no reason not

988
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,079
to they won't stand out

989
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
they won't be ridiculed but they will be

990
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,560
part of the in crowd if they hurry

991
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
so

992
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,119
over the next minute you'll see all of

993
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,800
the those that prefer to stick with the

994
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
crowd because eventually they would be

995
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,199
ridiculed for not joining in and that's

996
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,760
how you make a movement but let's recap

997
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
some lessons from this

998
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,159
so first if you are the type like the

999
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,239
shirtless dancing guy that is standing

1000
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,000
alone remember the importance of

1001
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,839
nurturing your first few followers as

1002
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
equals so it's clearly about the

1003
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,560
movement not you

1004
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,719
okay but we might have missed the real

1005
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,480
lesson here the biggest lesson if you

1006
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
noticed did you catch it is that

1007
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,520
leadership is over glorified

1008
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,200
that yes it was the shirtless guy was

1009
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
first and he'll get all the credit but

1010
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
it was really the first follower that

1011
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,240
transformed the lone nut into a leader

1012
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,760
so as we're told that we should all be

1013
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
leaders that would be really ineffective

1014
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
if you really care about starting a

1015
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,400
movement have the courage to follow and

1016
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
show others how to follow and when you

1017
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,560
find a lone nut doing something great

1018
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
have the guts to be the first one to

1019
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,960
stand up and join in and what a perfect

1020
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,880
place to do that ted thanks

1021
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
make sense

1022
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
chaotic systems once it moves it moves

1023
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
but following very important you don't

1024
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,160
have to be the guy standing up there or

1025
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,560
the girl standing up there it's fine

1026
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
support the thing you believe in right

1027
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
that's

1028
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,119
we don't do enough of that because

1029
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,160
somebody else will do it and that's

1030
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,440
human it's normal but scary

1031
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,359
message of this whole talk is not that

1032
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,440
oh god we're gonna be

1033
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
screwed because we will we will that's

1034
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,839
fine

1035
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,040
it is too late to be pessimistic

1036
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,200
there simply is no space for that

1037
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
you can go ah it's going to be terrible

1038
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,160
yeah whatever it's going to be terrible

1039
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
but now what

1040
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,839
so

1041
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,000
act that is really my message today is

1042
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,079
is do it almost doesn't matter what you

1043
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,040
do but act go out have fun have chunk

1044
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,720
enjoy party observe plan think

1045
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,839
teach

1046
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,400
build

1047
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
right but keep in mind what's the big

1048
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,760
picture how does it fit in and doesn't

1049
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
always have to fit in but you know vote

1050
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
not that i need to tell you people but

1051
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,079
make sure people go vote to the right

1052
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,760
things

1053
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,280
if you want to continue the conversation

1054
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,440
please meet us with the emergent earth

1055
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,760
village

1056
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,280
screenshot of the

1057
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
program it's all the way to the

1058
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,640
right

1059
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,079
so you have to scroll sideways because

1060
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,160
it's a huge program

1061
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,599
there's the flag you'll see it flying

1062
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,359
please do come there will be talks you

1063
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,560
can still submit the thing i know

1064
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
everything will be presenting something

1065
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
soon there are other people who have

1066
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,119
brought in last minute thing come and

1067
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,880
talk

1068
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
and thank you thank you for being here

1069
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,920
in the evening and staying away from the

1070
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
party to listen to depressing talk much

1071
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
appreciated

1072
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,800
and i'm happy to hang around a bit

1073
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,160
longer if you want to discuss because

1074
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,040
there's

1075
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,320
there's no program behind the section

1076
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
can i give you one question start which

1077
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
is um

1078
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
carbon capture technologies do you think

1079
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,880
they

1080
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,760
give us any hope

1081
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,280
okay so i'll repeat the question the

1082
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
question was will carbon capture and

1083
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,960
storage be the thing to help us um

1084
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,720
it's complicated

1085
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,400
and let me clarify it's complicated

1086
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
because currently most carbon capture

1087
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,160
storage technologies emit more co2 than

1088
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
the safe because of the energy intensity

1089
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
because you're taking extremely diluted

1090
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
gas

1091
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,240
you concentrate it's just

1092
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,320
thermodynamically terrible

1093
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
if you can get this done with sufficient

1094
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,560
renewables it's still a question

1095
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,200
now if you can capture the source at

1096
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,040
let's say at refinery i think it's a

1097
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,160
stop gap

1098
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,000
because you might give you a little bit

1099
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
it slows down it's not going to stop it

1100
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
but it'll slow down until we can develop

1101
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,800
other things however it's an excuse

1102
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,240
for keep on doing what we're doing and

1103
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,880
just kind of slap a slap a

1104
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,440
plaster on it and continue so i'm on

1105
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
very i'm not decided

1106
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,839
we do a lot of work on that though so

1107
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
it's been studied heavily but it's hard

1108
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,119
please

1109
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,599
if you can tell us

1110
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,359
what is your recommendation for the

1111
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,040
hacker spaces

1112
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,400
to do

1113
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
keep on keeping keep on existing

1114
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,880
can you say more

1115
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,800
i can say a lot but not something that's

1116
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
no but

1117
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,680
keep on existing and what i mean by that

1118
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,119
is when the hits the fan in

1119
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,440
whatever shape it is i want to be a

1120
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,200
member of a hacker space because that's

1121
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,320
where the knowledge is that's where the

1122
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,839
connections are that's what community is

1123
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,440
that's where skills are

1124
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
that's where information flows real

1125
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,520
quick and that's when how quicker know

1126
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
what's going on because we're a bunch of

1127
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,280
smart nerds

1128
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,440
what to do exactly i don't there's so

1129
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
many ways to do that

1130
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
but don't let them die we've seen i'm

1131
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
sure you've all seen that postcode with

1132
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
numbers of down attacker spaces

1133
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
struggling to get the camps going keep

1134
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
that going because we need that momentum

1135
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
we need smart people together not

1136
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,119
isolated

1137
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
hi i have a question

1138
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,480
are there any specific technologies that

1139
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,320
you would recommend us to research

1140
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,079
oh my god um

1141
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,119
excellent question by the way

1142
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
i do not believe that a sustainability

1143
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,599
transition at this point is a technical

1144
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,880
problem

1145
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
i'm convinced that it's not easy but i

1146
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,200
think we have the tech

1147
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
we know how to build solar we know how

1148
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,520
to build waves we know how to build wind

1149
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,119
farms

1150
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,480
highly controversial you could even do

1151
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
safe nuclear victorian whatever you

1152
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
could it is the organizational capacity

1153
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,040
is the political will it's the getting

1154
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,880
your head out of your ass and actually

1155
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
acting so i believe it's first and

1156
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,000
foremost a social problem if anything go

1157
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,359
vote go

1158
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,839
go become a president

1159
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,520
no i mean lead the political movement

1160
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
stand up have people vote for you and do

1161
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,920
the not bad things

1162
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,280
but tech specifically i don't think

1163
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,119
that's the problem it's there a lot is

1164
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,800
there

1165
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,400
and we tend to over obsess about

1166
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,560
technology because we are technologists

1167
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,319
but that's not the problem

1168
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,920
and you have to be very careful silicon

1169
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
valley keeps on making the mistake or

1170
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,440
we'll just fix it with more technology

1171
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
no

1172
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,240
it's a social problem not a technical

1173
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,200
problem

1174
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,640
and yes it has a technical component

1175
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,960
uh yes about social problems uh what are

1176
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
we going to do with the baby boom

1177
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,599
generation the uh they're

1178
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,880
they are with so many they started out

1179
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
voting for welfare systems when they

1180
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,720
were young and now they're starting to

1181
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,760
vote conservative extremely conservative

1182
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,520
etcetera talk to them about grandkids

1183
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,720
because they're you know there are

1184
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
parents they're not bad people per se i

1185
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,079
mean there's lots of but there

1186
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,520
are lots of very good people who just

1187
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,359
don't know better

1188
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,880
talk to them about the grandkids what

1189
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,160
kind of world do you want for your

1190
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,599
grandkid

1191
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,839
because that's one thing they'll care

1192
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,119
about because that's the thing that

1193
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,920
lives past beyond them

1194
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,079
but yeah that's we just have to you know

1195
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,160
there's a saying in science progresses

1196
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,200
one funeral at a time

1197
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,040
because that's how old ideas die it's

1198
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,160
when prominent old farts just clear the

1199
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,400
stage

1200
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,920
including myself at some point in all of

1201
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
us but that's what it is

1202
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
um at these hacker camps i'm always a

1203
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
bit conflicted about like the blinking

1204
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,400
lights because

1205
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,000
they look awesome

1206
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,319
they also consume energy i suppose no

1207
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,640
the decimal point somewhere there yeah

1208
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,040
but i mean i really see it also as a

1209
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,680
teaching possibility for people like how

1210
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,280
can you make uh

1211
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,520
like what do you consume but not how

1212
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
batteries whatever

1213
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
where do you think like uh what's your

1214
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,599
view on this and um

1215
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,400
where is like the

1216
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,440
the line where it becomes wasteful or

1217
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,200
that's a very

1218
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,960
loaded and very good question

1219
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,000
it is okay so when you do the math the

1220
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,599
lights are very irrelevant but people

1221
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,359
always like save the lan save the planet

1222
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,720
turn off the lights

1223
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,800
nobody cares eat two kilos of

1224
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,319
meat and you're done

1225
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,000
right so two kilos of meat less i'm

1226
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
sorry so the total energy value compared

1227
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,280
to what you normally would consume in

1228
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
you know anybody flown in from the us to

1229
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,200
be in the conference they've consumed

1230
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,720
this youtube budget for all the lights

1231
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,319
on this terrain instantly but at one

1232
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,119
trip so that's peanuts

1233
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,400
um i drive a 10 year old diesel car

1234
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,680
i am standing here talking about

1235
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,280
sustainability

1236
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,800
like what the

1237
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
why because i'm a poor academic

1238
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
and i can't afford a better one

1239
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,960
what i can afford is to talk about tell

1240
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,599
you about these things and talk to

1241
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,440
large petrochemical companies about

1242
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
making their stop more sustainable and

1243
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
when a single

1244
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,400
okay dow chemicals international holland

1245
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,839
the biggest plastic manufacturer in

1246
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,319
europe they have a single machine that

1247
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,119
takes 900 megawatts

1248
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,319
of thermal

1249
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,800
power continuously

1250
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,720
that's several cities worth of power in

1251
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,560
a single machine when that thing goes

1252
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,480
sustainable through hopefully my work i

1253
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,280
can fly my arrest okay know what i mean

1254
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,079
so it's very hard to because

1255
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,240
you know eat less meat not have kids

1256
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,400
that have kids but make teach them to be

1257
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,079
smart and responsible

1258
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,720
um don't fly

1259
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,839
those things matter blinking lights

1260
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,800
leds

1261
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,560
so yes have fun because otherwise you'll

1262
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,079
be depressed and not actually

1263
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,599
doing anything no but that's important

1264
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,440
because if you're not here

1265
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
to enjoy life and care about life and

1266
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,720
want to make sure it keeps on going then

1267
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,880
you know celebrate life while staring

1268
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,560
death in dies

1269
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,630
 you yeah

1270
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:36,400
[Applause]

1271
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,160
actually that pretty much brings us time

1272
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,400
unless anyone has any very very last

1273
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,240
questions

1274
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,720
no so i guess thank you very much thank

1275
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,200
you all very much

1276
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,960
