so yeah yeah to me um but uh i bow in

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
respect to a lot of hackers in uh in

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,719
this um

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,840
uh on this ground because um

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
i'm i'm well most of the hackers have

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
this thing called

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
what's the word for it imposter syndrome

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
well so do i

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
uh so i think i know nothing and still

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
i've been doing open source for 20 years

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
and i'm pretty happy yay me um okay

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
phone world of today well

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
uh the user is the product right you buy

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
a phone either ios or android those are

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
the two flavors mainstream flavors

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and the user is the product every piece

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
of data is collected even weather apps

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
do nothing more than sending home your

61
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,840
gps location constantly and those that

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
data is being sold

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
and you're thinking oh this is an

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
innocent weather app well it's nothing

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
innocent about it you're being tracked

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
and you're doing it voluntarily in a way

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,120
um

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
what's up sends data continuously we

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
don't know what data because it's of

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
course an ssl encryption of tls these

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
days

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
um so we don't know what data set but it

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
sends continuously even if you don't

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
talk or the

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
t type or whatever to anybody

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
data is sold to companies for targeting

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,800
ads and and market ads is these days

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,599
well

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,560
everybody's in the market of selling ads

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,159
in one way try to avoid ads for once try

81
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
to avoid for a minute not seeing a brand

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,720
name

83
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
just look around right this second and

84
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,519
you'll see brand names everywhere and

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
we're so used to it but subliminal they

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,440
work you always see there was this guy

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,799
who made a habit of putting posted cards

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
on every brand name in his house

89
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
well he wouldn't see brand names but it

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
was a very yellow interior

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
other alternatives yes there are and i'm

92
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
here to talk about one of them

93
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,359
well there's a ubuntu touch

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
what does it look like well there is a

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
10 minute demo

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,879
it's on youtube and i invite all of you

97
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
to watch it

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,839
i can try to

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
do i have connection here this is

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
spontaneous and a demo so it probably

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
won't work

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
let's see if i click on this

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
see there we go doesn't work

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,479
i didn't make a link out of it

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
okay

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
silly me

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
anyway

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
what what i'll put it does we don't

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
collect data

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
so that's of course

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
one of the goals

112
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,960
um

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
and we have the development of this

114
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,199
ubuntu touch project governed by the ub

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
ports foundation that's based in berlin

116
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,680
and

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
one of the reasons it's based in berlin

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
is because germany has one of the most

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
stricted privacy laws there is

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,479
some of the initiatives like the

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
founding of the ubers foundation was

122
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
sponsored by people but

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
you know how there is this book the most

124
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
people are good well

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
this one was too

126
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
although he's the sponsor he also made

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
sure that in the bylaws of the

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
foundation it's impossible

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
impossible for

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
sponsors to become member of the board

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
of directors

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
so yes you can sponsor

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
and will probably listen to you but you

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
don't have any formal say in stuff so

135
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,960
you keep your independence as a

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
foundation

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,280
um currently we have an app store that

138
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,080
contains about 1200 apps

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,800
so

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,479
if you install ubuntu touch on your

141
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,360
phone

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
you have 1100 apps to choose from that

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
includes several navigation apps we have

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
a telegram app we don't have a whatsapp

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
app

146
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,440
but there are games that there's a lot

147
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
to to choose from

148
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,400
and if you go to devices.ubuntu-touch.io

149
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,560
you will find 81 devices that will

150
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
support ubuntu touch

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
with seven of them marked as top choice

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
when i say 81 are supported they are

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
supported

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
from poorly to excellent

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
and the seven best ones

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
are uh of course the top choice

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
um

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
and more on how that works behind the

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
screen a little later small history 2011

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
canonical stars ubuntu touch

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,639
and everybody says

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,960
ubuntu nice os works a nice desktop see

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
what they will do

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
and in 2015 mary's gripscart a norwegian

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,479
guy says okay let's let's also do a

166
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,960
hacker community next to it so we

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,000
because

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
economical only supported two or three

169
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
devices officially

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
and of course they were hackers saying

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,800
well i can port this to my device so

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
there was a secure a community of

173
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
hackers was was coming to life

174
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
um in 2017 canonical abandons uh both

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,199
ubuntu touch and the unity project and

176
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,360
unity being the the ui part of ubuntu

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
dutch

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,199
for

179
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
actually for business reasons so they

180
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
had a thriving product thriving

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
community but had to focus on other

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
projects and decided to cancel this one

183
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
which was of course very sad

184
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
well

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
the same year

186
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
we as a community

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,840
launched the ubiport's installer

188
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
and that's an application for linux

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
windows and mac you install the uv ports

190
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,280
installer you connect with a usb your

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
phone and it will tell you if it can

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
install ubuntu touch on it and if you

193
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
say yeah do that it will do that for you

194
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
now if for any chance there is something

195
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
going wrong no worries we have a

196
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,160
telegram help desk where there are nice

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,199
people

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
responding to that if people run into

199
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
trouble but given the volume of installs

200
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
it does happen sometimes but it doesn't

201
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
happen a lot

202
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
and the community starts the helium

203
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
project as well in 2017 and the helium

204
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,640
the hell is the hardware extraction

205
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
layer and that's where the name is a

206
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,039
derivative from

207
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,760
to try to

208
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
make a separation between the hardware

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,560
and the software

210
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
you see hell principles also in other

211
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,199
computer systems

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
the 2019 that's when the ub ports

213
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
foundation is getting established

214
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
uh with bases in berlin

215
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,760
and

216
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
well that's the history so far in a

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
nutshell

218
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
now what did we do last year

219
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,800
well we did stuff

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
the apps

221
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,880
ecosystem is keeps on growing we we

222
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
constantly increase the number of apps

223
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
people from the community

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
develop new apps that run on ubuntu

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
touch we have a very nice

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
development environment based on

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
clickable

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
and clickable is sort of a qt based

229
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
because the gui is qt

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
we have a qt based uh system where with

231
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
clickable you can say oh i want to code

232
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
in javascript or i want to code in rust

233
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,560
i want to code in in python or i want to

234
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
code in c plus you can do all that and

235
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
you you you when you start a project you

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
simply select what program you want to

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
use

238
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,720
and it will set up the initial

239
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
infrastructure and and create a sort of

240
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
vanilla hello world

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,600
application for you that you can start

242
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,320
building up on

243
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,959
we are

244
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,680
last year and today still

245
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
investing in the 2004 mission

246
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
and the

247
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
story behind that is that the current

248
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
release

249
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
of ubuntu touch is still based on ubuntu

250
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
1604.

251
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,880
now 1604 may sound like really old to

252
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
the average desktop user but in embedded

253
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
systems like a phone

254
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
you don't change your os so very very

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
frequently

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,839
so

257
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
you do but you don't so so often

258
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
so yeah we have to migrate and we do

259
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
that about every four or five years so

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
after 16 comes 20 and we're still

261
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
working on the migration to 20 which

262
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
also means a big shift

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,519
from the old

264
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,720
upstart to system systemd

265
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
which is a it's a big job

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
uh we're still of course maintaining

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,040
1604 and even uh bringing in new

268
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
features on that platform

269
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
um

270
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,959
and last year we had a new board of

271
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
directors and membership committee so

272
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,399
the membership committee

273
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
is a committee that

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
decides if somebody

275
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
who has

276
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
spent

277
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
more than i believe three months of

278
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
uh of effort into

279
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,399
three months or six months i i forgot

280
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
sorry um

281
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
uh who has done investment in the

282
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
community if he's eligible for um

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
for the election to either be elected or

284
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,079
to give a vote on the candidates

285
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
so that's the democratic system behind

286
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,880
it

287
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
and the

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
so the membership committee allows

289
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,079
people to vote and when you have the

290
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,000
right to vote you get an email you vote

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
on the candidates and those become the

292
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
new

293
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
board of directors

294
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
what are we doing this year well clearly

295
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,320
a continuation 2004 is where currently

296
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,959
lots of efforts are put into because we

297
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,720
really want to make that transition to

298
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
2004

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
and it's it's a biggie

300
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,279
are challenges there if there are people

301
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
here who love to participate

302
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,220
please do

303
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,360
[Music]

304
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
we still do the release of the on the

305
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,079
air updates for 1604

306
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,920
and the last one was uh 28th of june

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
so that's pretty recent

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
uh so any phone that gets on the air

309
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,519
updates

310
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,240
is pretty much up to date on on on the

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
current software that's uh that works

312
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
pretty well

313
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
uh we're currently getting marketing

314
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
streamlined so we have a new board of

315
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
directors there is

316
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
new plans for marketing campaigns uh

317
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
which also means

318
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
um how do you

319
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
get out the message to the world that we

320
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,639
exist

321
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,519
and

322
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
when are we a valid alternative

323
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,240
um

324
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
if you go to any shop a phone shop in

325
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
the netherlands you won't get a ubuntu

326
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
touch phone if you go to a phone one

327
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
phone shop in hamburg you can get an

328
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
ubuntu touch phone we have one one shop

329
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,639
already up two actually because they're

330
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
sisters of each other so two shops where

331
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
you can get over the phone uh you can go

332
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,000
to the web and you can order phones with

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
ubuntu touch pre-installed that's

334
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,079
already uh

335
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
there

336
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
we did a few awareness campaigns

337
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,320
i got interviewed in the netherlands by

338
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
the financial docublot

339
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
in a two-page interview about this i've

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,959
been on bnr

341
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
business news radio in the netherlands

342
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,079
with a podcast in the technology about

343
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,600
ubport so

344
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
we're trying to get that message out i'm

345
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
standing here now so there's also again

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,399
a message that will be recorded so we

347
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,519
can

348
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,160
use the link very very often i hope

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,279
so

350
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,399
it's constantly looking at okay where do

351
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,560
we find our audience and how can we

352
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,040
reach that audience to tell them about

353
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
look here's a phone that values your

354
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
privacy as much as you do

355
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
we are not in the business of data data

356
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,639
doesn't interest us other than that your

357
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
navigation should work you know that

358
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
data yeah but not what you're doing with

359
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
the phone is your business and not ours

360
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,880
it's an open source

361
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
operating system

362
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
we are still in the business of

363
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,279
strengthening cooperation with more

364
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,279
hardware partners

365
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,399
and

366
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,480
there are several

367
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
phone manufacturers who

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,160
um

369
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,959
uh

370
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
like to work with us well i hope they

371
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,399
like to work with that but we like to

372
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
work with them definitely

373
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
on getting ubuntu touch working on their

374
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,160
hardware so they can sell their phones

375
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,399
they can get the message out and we try

376
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
to make sure that the the software works

377
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
as best as possible

378
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,560
and basically keep our users as happy as

379
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
possible

380
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,800
that the thing just works you know

381
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,279
like and that was the title of the talk

382
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
making sure we have a phone that does

383
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
what you expect and nothing more

384
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
um

385
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,480
now what's hot on our endless backlog

386
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
well there is a first book about app

387
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
development and

388
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
um

389
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,880
even if the cover on on the screen uh

390
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
you can now if you like order this on

391
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
lulu.com publishing on demand you always

392
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
have the latest content

393
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
in the book

394
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,320
we did a workshop yesterday with this

395
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,040
training book everybody who attended the

396
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
training got a piece of gutter

397
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,040
got one of those books

398
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,120
and um

399
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
people can now

400
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,279
well

401
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,519
follow along who does the training how

402
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,480
you can

403
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,560
develop apps and we are already

404
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,240
discussing what to do in a second book

405
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,360
so

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,160
it's very likely that i will become

407
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,800
uh in existence a second book on um

408
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
programming for ubuntu touch and that

409
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,920
one goes more into sensor stuff because

410
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
the gui and how an application works

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
we've already covered that in in part

412
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
one

413
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
we have volte who here has ever heard of

414
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
volte before

415
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,399
okay maybe i should change that who

416
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
hasn't heard of faulty before

417
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,720
yeah okay so maybe i should explain to

418
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
you because the other ones already know

419
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,199
it right

420
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
so volte stands for voice over lte and

421
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,839
lte is an extension if i'm correctly of

422
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,280
g4 gsm generation 4

423
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
which means you get sort of a data voice

424
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,839
over ip over a wireless connection

425
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,439
and it's clearly the future of

426
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,039
phone calls

427
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,319
so the

428
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
the 2g and 3g second generation third

429
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
generation gsm

430
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
networks are already being switched off

431
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
so at some point your phone needs to

432
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
support volte otherwise you can't make a

433
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
phone call

434
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,039
which would be bad for phone

435
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,600
well come think of it who uses his phone

436
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,919
for phone calls these days right

437
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
oh you do okay yeah one of the few

438
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
probably um

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,799
and for wifi then as a self-explanatory

440
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,600
right you simply do voice over wi-fi

441
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
which in a way is easier because you

442
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
don't have to connect to a modem with

443
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,039
certain encryption standards and

444
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
well

445
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
access the the modem part of the

446
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,160
hardware

447
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
that has his own protocol which is not

448
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
really open and well there are

449
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,639
challenges there

450
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
we are working on video calls for native

451
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
apps we're working on cell broadcast

452
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,559
esim

453
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,080
that's of course also a new development

454
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
that you don't get a sim card but you

455
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
get a sort of

456
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,360
a key that is your authorization to

457
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,240
access the wireless network

458
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
uh bluetooth

459
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
well we have bluetooth but they're

460
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,679
still

461
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
showing up new devices with new

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
extensions on bluetooth that we need to

463
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
support in ubuntu touch as well

464
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
power management is of course always

465
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
crucial because you want your phone to

466
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,799
last as long as possible and

467
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,559
we're developing policies for apps in

468
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,640
the background because currently it is a

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,919
linux kernel

470
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,000
on top of that we have android we have

471
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
helium hardware abstraction layer we

472
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,200
have ubuntu touch as the gui and app

473
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
environment

474
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
and

475
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,520
it doesn't

476
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
run apps in the background that's

477
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
by design and we're thinking about well

478
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,840
maybe we should

479
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,400
um

480
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
device backup and recovery also

481
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,039
something that's well nice to have at

482
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
least

483
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
um now how do we do some of those stuffs

484
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
well volte for instance we work uh with

485
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,919
sysmocom

486
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,400
as anybody of you know who has not heard

487
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
of sysmoncom before

488
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
yeah a lot of you right okay who has not

489
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,840
heard of osmocom before

490
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
okay so

491
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
osmocom is an open source interface

492
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,720
hence the os mocom

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,080
with which you can set up your own gsm

494
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
network

495
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
so you take a bunch of raspberry pi's

496
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
you take a certain piece of hardware

497
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
which is

498
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
um not really very cheap but then you

499
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
can create your own gsm network

500
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
you put an antenna in the air and

501
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
suddenly you have gsm mch

502
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
you can't do that in a lens because of

503
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,440
licenses but

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
other than that is technically possible

505
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
well osmocom is an open source project

506
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
run by harold welter also from berlin

507
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
i believe anyway for german i think he's

508
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
in berlin but i'm not exactly sure

509
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,320
and he also has

510
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,080
a commercial company sysmocom where they

511
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
work on

512
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
protocols wireless protocols on phones

513
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,919
in the broadest sense of the of the word

514
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,960
so they work on well ios i guess android

515
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
definitely and they also work from us on

516
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
developing volt for um

517
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,080
ubuntu touch and that's for instance

518
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,559
sponsored development so somebody's

519
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,360
picking up that bill

520
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,000
knowledge management

521
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,840
well like i said recently released

522
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
application development training the

523
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
training is by the way cc license so

524
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
everybody can use it it's you don't have

525
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,919
to buy the book it's also on the web

526
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,080
uh urls will probably follow in this

527
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,639
slide deck

528
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,159
we have a forum with 1.2 million

529
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,320
hits every month so there's a lot of

530
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
discussion going on a lot of development

531
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
a lot of people

532
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,679
talking about how to get things done how

533
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,280
to build stuff

534
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
like i said it's it's a big community

535
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,080
it's it's globally and that's

536
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,840
it's amazing sometimes i get emails from

537
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,559
people all over the world of course

538
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,200
uh with with questions that when they

539
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
are related to marketing i'll get them

540
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
so

541
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
thankfully those are not hundreds

542
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
because i couldn't cope but

543
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
yeah there's a lot of action going on

544
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,400
we have some general telegram channels

545
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
like uv ports

546
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,840
general

547
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
telegram that works everywhere we have a

548
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400

549
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,919
would install

550
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,480
ubuntu touch on your device with the uv

551
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
ports installer and you run into any

552
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360

will help you out and i can say that

556
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
with confidence because i had the same

557
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
challenge myself

558
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,879
that's about two years ago

559
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
and there's of course uv port sporting

560
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,080
if you have a device and you want to get

561
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,880
that

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
uh

563
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
ubuntu touch for that device running and

564
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
you have porting questions you can ask

565
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
around and people should be able to help

566
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,200
you

567
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
port stuff to the device that you want

568
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,200
to port to if you're into that kind of

569
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
thing

570
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
and that's just a sub group because we

571
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
have a telegram channel for almost every

572
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,120
language in the world including dutch

573
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
mum who is sitting here is very active

574
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,720
in the dutch group

575
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,520
thank you so much

576
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
and

577
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
yesterday we had terence helping out

578
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,720
he's from the community helping out on

579
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
the application development we have

580
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
sander from the dutch community who also

581
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,320
pitched in developing the training stuff

582
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,720
it's it's amazing what we as a community

583
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
do

584
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
support supported devices well they show

585
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,918
again on devices.ubuntu.io

586
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,279
and the data that they shown there

587
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,960
is a representation of a yaml file

588
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,919
so whenever somebody

589
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
adds a device he creates a yaml file

590
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,320
with um

591
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,000
a list of features and whether or not

592
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
this port already supports that feature

593
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
and if there are still some issues with

594
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,919
some functionality you can even add a

595
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,799
link to the ticket on gitlab so people

596
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
can do the research and maybe say oh

597
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
yeah let me fix that for instance

598
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
or do some more research

599
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
and um the repository of those yaml

600
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,159
files is shown in this url which i won't

601
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
repeat here and you probably are not

602
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,840
interested at the moment but i will

603
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
upload the slides and you can look at

604
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
them later right

605
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
okay

606
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,590
that's it

607
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,679
[Music]

608
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,480
i'm

609
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,640
i'm even surprised myself that i'm

610
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,960
already at the end

611
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
it's

612
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,919
those are only 14 slides and

613
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,120
i think i just about covered everything

614
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
from an awareness perspective

615
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,480
but

616
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
every subject has his own

617
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,960
death that you can dive into and talk

618
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,039
about and

619
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,640
i'm not one of the ubuntu touch

620
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,960
developers you know i do develop stuff

621
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
but python linux c rust and go i'm

622
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,880
learning those two but

623
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,559
this is a business

624
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
with a speciality and

625
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,039
i'm not qualified as a technician to do

626
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,320
technical ubuntu touch stuff but

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
this is absolutely an amazing project

628
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320

world

659
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,159
make it better by using and distributing

660
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
a phone os that puts the user first and

661
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,240
doesn't see the user as a product

662
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,320
so i'll shut up now and let's go to

663
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,279

hope my question hasn't been already

671
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,400
been answered in the first couple of

672
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
minutes um about apps i wanted to know

673
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
um

674
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
are you planning to make it easier to

675
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
port android apps either by um

676
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
having a compatible api or maybe even an

677
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,480
android runtime yeah so

678
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
android is in a way uh slimmed down and

679
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,080
in ubuntu touch but we don't support uh

680
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
the apps like on android android we

681
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,559
don't support android apps but

682
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,679
there is there's a group working on a

683
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,440
nbox an nbox is sort of a container for

684
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,799
android apps

685
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,919
so

686
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,000
yes you can run whatsapp on ubuntu touch

687
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
because whatsapp can run in nbox which

688
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,559
runs on ubuntu touch

689
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,760
but

690
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,399
don't shoot me if it's still a little

691
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,640
bit buggy so i i won't say it's ah you

692
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,480
should go that direction but yeah we're

693
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
working on it it's promising i know

694
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
people who say yeah it works for me

695
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,159
great fine but i'm i'm not convinced

696
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,080
that it's rock stable and everybody can

697
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,159
use that all right

698
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
you're welcome mike in the back please

699
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
hi i had a look at

700
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,240
the list of the supported devices online

701
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,039
sure and i noticed that out of the seven

702
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,880
start devices there's two made by google

703
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,720
you can feel my question coming

704
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,120
how confident do you feel saying that if

705
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,799
you combine one of these google devices

706
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,640
with ubuntu touch

707
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
that none of the user's data gets

708
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,279
collected and sold well it's yes it's a

709
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,559
ubuntu it's a google phone hardware you

710
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
wipe the software you put your own stuff

711
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,240
in it

712
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,480
and you don't track people

713
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,559
it's as simple as that

714
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,960
yeah unless of course they made

715
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
something embedded

716
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,679
that we don't know about

717
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:58,480
yeah

718
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,000
but that's the same that's the same for

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
intel processors where there's minix

720
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,039
running in

721
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,640
and probably is a way to upgrade that

722
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
either replace it by something else and

723
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
we still don't know how to do that

724
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
or i miss the talk about it here that

725
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,480
wouldn't surprise me in a bit

726
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,240
okay thanks oh you're welcome

727
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
ah yeah thank you

728
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
i see you have a lot of telegram

729
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,520
channels yes are also plans to migrate

730
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,799
to a more distributed system like matrix

731
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,000
for instance

732
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
yeah there are matrix clients for for

733
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,799
but to touch definitely yes i mean

734
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,080
also the

735
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
support the support channels you have

736
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
okay

737
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,799
well

738
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
it's a community so it's you can't catch

739
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,000
them so no doubt there are matrix

740
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
channels there are discord uh

741
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
initiatives uh we have a forum we have

742
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,840
telegram it's it's all over the place so

743
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
probably it's full of bridges already

744
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
yeah that that one i know for sure yeah

745
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,039
okay thank you you're welcome

746
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,158
mike in the back please

747
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,919
i'm somewhat confused

748
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,240
ub ports ubuntu

749
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
yeah

750
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,840
uh is ubuntu still in place in play

751
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,600
okay so

752
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,440
you have ubuntu

753
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
as a distribution which is made by

754
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,279
canonical and they have the brand name

755
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,000
for the word ubuntu right and the circle

756
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,799
of friend symbol

757
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
they started ubuntu touch and they have

758
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,360
abandoned that product

759
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
and now a

760
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
community is continue to work on ubuntu

761
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
touch

762
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,080
but a community cannot get

763
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,679
a license to use a brand name so there

764
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,919
is a ubports foundation

765
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,679
which is the legal body to try to govern

766
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,679
as much as you can govern an open source

767
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,039
community i think i don't have to

768
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,279
explain that here

769
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,399
but that's from a legal standpoint

770
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,679
an entity that helps

771
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,440
the community in getting things done so

772
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,080
if a company wants to

773
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,480
have a contract with another entity they

774
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
cannot make a contract with the

775
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,240
community but they can have a contract

776
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
with the ub ports foundation and the ub

777
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,360
foundation is a license holder of the

778
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,559
ubuntu touch brand name

779
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
logo and

780
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,399
derivatives

781
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,640
if i recall correct

782
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,480
ub ports

783
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
and they have the domain name

784
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,440
ubuntu

785
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,960
io

786
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,799
but the legal identity is ubuntu ports

787
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,000
on top

788
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
uh the ub foundation has several domain

789
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,120
names and actually i don't know if they

790
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,919
own ubuntu touch because also the the

791
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,240
app store is an initiative of one of the

792
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
community members so he has the domain

793
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
name and he has the app store

794
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,519
and

795
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,320
he runs a very good ship i must say

796
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,000
but he owns

797
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,840
the open store dot io domain name as an

798
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
example

799
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,600
uh okay thank you no yeah fine messy

800
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,799
okay

801
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,840
mike in the front

802
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,480
please okay and uh in the start you were

803
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,600
talking about uh the weather app

804
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,399
collecting data yeah

805
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,880
the weather app on this device

806
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,120
on this software wouldn't that also

807
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,399
collect the same data yeah and sell it

808
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,279
no

809
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,240
why not

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
well why would we

811
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,720
because it's the same company

812
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,000
no it isn't for the webinar

813
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,799
no

814
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,240
there are weather apps for ubuntu touch

815
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
that get the location data from the gps

816
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,679
sensor

817
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,480
and use that to do a

818
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,360
probably a rest call to an a weather api

819
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
somewhere online to get away the weather

820
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,960
data

821
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,919
uh but it's not stored it's not uh sold

822
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,960
it's

823
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,159
uh we only use it for the purpose for

824
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,519
which it is intended because we

825
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,840
and with we i mean both the community

826
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,320
but also the ubi foundation are not

827
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
interested in user data because we're

828
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,679
not in the business of selling user data

829
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,760
and that's the one of the founding

830
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,039
principles

831
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,200
of the foundation

832
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,799
yeah i know but the people the company

833
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,519
who makes the weather app is interested

834
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
for your

835
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,080
touch

836
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
wouldn't they collect that data

837
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,080
if you if there would be an ubuntu touch

838
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,200
application created by a company who

839
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,640
wants to sell off your gps location yeah

840
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
then you're right

841
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
but we have a large community and a

842
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
weather app from the community is simply

843
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,440
a weather app from the community who

844
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
does not sell off data

845
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,759
thank you you're welcome

846
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,320
how good is the quality of the product

847
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,719
would you use it as a daily driver

848
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,639
lots of people are using it as a daily

849
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,119
driver

850
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,599
i when i started this i'm going to be

851
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,839
honest right when i got started this

852
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,239
project i got a phone officially

853
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,719
supported ubuntu touch

854
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,159
and

855
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,440
i

856
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
switched my sim card and i went to a

857
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,040
meeting an hour drive away and the

858
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
meeting was longer than i expected so i

859
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,320
was gone a long time and i started using

860
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,720
the navigation to get there and by the

861
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,760
time i got there navigation didn't work

862
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
and

863
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
also it was not able to answer telegram

864
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,200
messages or

865
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,359
calls and i did it and my wife was

866
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,440
trying to call me as in when are you

867
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
coming home and i didn't pick up my

868
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
phone which was

869
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,800
rare

870
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,320
and that's one and a half years ago

871
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,040
and the next release fixed it that fixed

872
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,400
dead bug

873
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
so since then

874
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
i can assure you rock solid connectivity

875
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,720
absolutely um i know of people in the

876
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
audience that i won't mention by name at

877
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
the moment who started working with

878
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
ubuntu touch as a two-week experiment oh

879
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,359
i have a phone lying around let's see

880
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,240
how this works that's years ago

881
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,640
and it's yeah it works and they were

882
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,520
happy and they kept on using it

883
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,359
and i think that's

884
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,200
that's the way you should address this

885
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,400
it's a tool it's a connectivity tool and

886
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
it's not a sensor

887
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,119
for multiple commercial entities it's

888
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,720
your device

889
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,760
and and you use it for what you want to

890
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,720
do with it and that's it

891
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
and that's what i

892
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,240
passionately believe in

893
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,599
thank you you're welcome

894
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
if you ask questions please come close

895
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
to the microphone you're helping our av

896
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
angels um

897
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,280
working

898
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
yeah thank you um there's basically a

899
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
follow-up question of the previous

900
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,079
previous

901
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,480
question here how do you make sure that

902
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,359
the

903
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
app stores for ub ports stay clean of

904
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,720
checking tracking companies especially

905
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
if uv ports will grow and you get

906
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,560
millions of users

907
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,320
which i hope will happen

908
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,800
um then there's a business case for

909
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
providing apps that do all this tracking

910
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,599
stuff

911
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,079
as they do now on android yeah and

912
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,400
if we are massively

913
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,839
successful

914
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
that some taiwanese developer thinks hey

915
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
let me put a bitcoin miner in there

916
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,359
because yay bitcoins

917
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,480
um

918
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
then that means we're massively

919
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,720
successful so that part is good and we

920
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
have to figure out how to solve this

921
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,880
bitcoin mining stuff right

922
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
currently we have this guy running the

923
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,560
open store who reviews the contributions

924
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,359
and

925
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,240
um

926
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,720
most of those contributions have

927
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
when you submit an application you

928
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
upload an icon you put in a name and and

929
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,400
the url to the to the git repository

930
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,280
so

931
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
that's already

932
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,200
if you put in a hidden bitcoin miner you

933
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
probably won't mention the url where

934
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
they can find the code

935
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,240
so it's relatively easy to to review

936
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
that

937
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
um

938
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,960
but yeah currently

939
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,520
we're pretty safe and we're relatively

940
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,800
small

941
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,680
and

942
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,119
that makes it easy to to be safe

943
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,240
and

944
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,880
if we become more successful

945
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,520
we get more event

946
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
sellers of phones

947
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,880
which will probably donate uh

948
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,440
some money to the ub foundation which is

949
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,359
not mandatory you can use it for free

950
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,760
but it's in the interest of a vendor to

951
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,839
support ubi foundation to continue

952
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
development of the os right

953
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,920
and then we can hire people

954
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
even if the community can't

955
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,920
handle that

956
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,160
workload we hire people to do the

957
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,640
security reviews of newly

958
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
submitted apps

959
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,040
you

960
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,520
it's a hard requirement to have open

961
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,359
source

962
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,920
apps for your play stores app stores

963
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,880
well currently it's it's not mandatory

964
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,040
and you can you said these are those are

965
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,079
clickable apps uh but you can program in

966
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,440
also in russian

967
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,480
c plus plus c plus is of course compiled

968
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,440
so

969
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,760
you would get uh

970
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
an application that is does not need to

971
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
be open source okay if it's an open if

972
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,599
it's a javascript application in qml

973
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,839
embed it then

974
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,079
everybody can read the source code right

975
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
uh when it's c plus and you only see the

976
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,320
compiled result you don't know what's

977
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,800
behind it

978
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,920
so so is your question maybe i can help

979
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,079
you out it's a question more about

980
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,880
what's the equivalent to um google play

981
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
protect for example where google says we

982
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
will make sure that this is not a

983
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
malicious software is is the question

984
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,320
going in that direction

985
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,680
well that's another uh

986
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
thinking of similar processes that

987
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,000
android store has to review the apps to

988
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
make sure that everything that comes

989
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,599
into it is really open source yeah

990
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,200
um

991
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,839
what i'm

992
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,720
seeing uh with my open source track

993
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,440
record i i see a community that's that's

994
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,400
thriving that's developing good stuff

995
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
and that is also

996
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,560
evolving

997
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,599
so at some point no doubt there should

998
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,560
be mandatory review of new apps and then

999
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,319
somebody will pick up the challenge and

1000
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,400
organize that and make that happen are

1001
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,000
we currently there no we're currently

1002
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,480
not there yet but yeah i've every

1003
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,720
confidence that we will

1004
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,800
at the moment that we see that happening

1005
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,599
because

1006
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,200
as a foundation

1007
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,560
we don't have a commercial interest

1008
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720
and we want to

1009
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,079
make a popular and safe

1010
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,720
open source

1011
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,279
operating system for mobile devices

1012
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,960
well nice thank you okay you're welcome

1013
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
are there any more questions

1014
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,119
you're probably around somewhere right

1015
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,640
where can people reach you

1016
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,680
um well jeromeypods.com

1017
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,880
