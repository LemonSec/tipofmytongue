00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
over lockdown i designed my first pcb um

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,400
i was really intimidated before i had no

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,160
idea if it was going to work and it did

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,359
and it was amazing it was the most

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,160
exciting thing uh to see this creation

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,439
come to life

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,599
and do a very boring job of changing the

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
brightness on my monitors um this was

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
largely in part uh to keycad which

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,480
is a free and open source piece of

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
software which you probably already know

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
because you're here watching this talk

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
um these two people here know more than

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
anything how important uh keycard is to

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
the open source community uh so this is

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
superpressure and clement uh they both

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,960
in their free time and possibly for jobs

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,480
as well hack on hardware for fun and

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
profit um and they are gonna talk to us

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
about some of the cool add-ons that can

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
make keycad even more enjoyable to use

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,079
so please give them a big hand

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
right hello everyone

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
welcome to our talk uh so we're here to

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
tell you about the

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
ecosystem of tools that people have

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,119
built around gcat so kitkat is awesome

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,720
we all agree about that

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
uh if you don't know what kicad is i'm

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
very surprised you're here but

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
it's uh a really nice tool for making

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
circuit boards

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,520
um and it's awesome and some people have

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
made it even more awesome but

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
sadly a lot of people who use it have no

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,799
idea

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
that there's all these wonderful extra

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
tools that are not part of kicad but

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
that you can use with it so we're here

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
to do a bit of show and tell and get you

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
excited about it and

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,920
hopefully

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,119
make your life

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,680
as much easier as these tools have

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
for

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,680
us so first of all

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
uh there's this thing called the plug-in

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
and content manager in kicad and it's

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
possible you're not aware that this is a

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
thing because when when the first

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
version that had it was released

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
uh it was a bit hidden

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
like literally not visible in the main

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
window but that's been fixed now so

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
update your kick out it will be there

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
and many of the things that like we're

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
going to show you are on there and

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
there's also many other cool plugins

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
that people have built so go there and

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
check it out it's uh

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
it's got a lot of good stuff

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
right over here

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,040
all right so i'm going to start to show

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
you kai buzzard which makes pretty

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
labels it's in the plugin in content

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,720
manager we just had

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,599
so

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
we prepared a little demo on how that

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
looks

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
so usually when you have your board and

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
you want to add some text to explain

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
what's happening you use the text tool

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,200
placed it somewhere and you have the

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
boring text with like the boring font

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
but you can do nice labels with this

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,640
add-on so i just pressed the button on

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
the top right

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,360
see that again like over here open that

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
you can put in your text you can

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
specify how it looks so i'm changing the

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
corner style here

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,360
and

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
yeah we have our label just place it

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
as simple as that and

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
do more of them

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
and

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
those are really nice we are going to

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,800
see them in the 3d view in a moment

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
over there and that is exactly how they

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
will look on the finished board so this

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
is pretty nice

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,319
the next one i'm going to show you is

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,440
the interactive html bone so the bomb is

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
the bill of materials

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,319
you

97
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,159
use that to order parts but also when

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
you assemble the board to see which

99
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,680
parts go where

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
which you have already placed and so on

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
and this thing as it says is interactive

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
so i'm going to show how it looks we are

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
going to start with like this is our

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
finished board in a 3d view

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
we want to assemble that this is it in

106
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,200
the pcb view

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
and what you need to do is figure out

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
which part it is that goes there so you

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
can open up that part see what it is

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,799
pick it and place it but that's that's

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
pretty tedious to do

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,080
so we are generating that bomb

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
and opening that up in our browser so

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,839
it's just one html file that contains

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
everything

116
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
and there you have a pcb view that is

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
linked with the bom table

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
as you can see when i hover over the

119
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,720
table it highlights the parts

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
that are on the pcb so i can see what

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,840
they are it goes both directions

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,479
so i can place

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
the same values pretty easily

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,639
and

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
then there's also on the left side of

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,479
the table there's those check boxes you

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,440
can use to track which parts you already

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,600
like sourced or put in your parts bin

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
and which parts are already on your

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
board and that is actually configurable

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
so you can add more rows of that for

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,240
other check boxes like i ordered that

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
part i put it in the right place i

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,560
prepared it for assembly i put it on the

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
board and so on

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
you can also configure if stuff should

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
get grouped or so on so there's lots of

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
options to that i

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,800
figure them out for yourself i guess

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,759
yeah

141
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,120
that's it for

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
the interactive html bomb

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
i really like that you can also use it

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
on a tablet computer for example i just

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
put it it's just an html file put it

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
on your workbench

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,600
press things and be done

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,639
there we go

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
now even camera okay

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:40,970
so

151
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,240
[Music]

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
that was i think our second tool so up

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
for our third tool which is called key

154
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
kit

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,360
that one is used to make panels of pcb

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
so if you have a single pcb but want to

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,960
have a panel of them

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
that automates that stuff so you don't

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
have to draw your panel manually as you

160
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,479
would have done in

161
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,680
earlier before this tool didn't exist so

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
here's a quick demo of that

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
so we start with our single pcb it's a

164
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
rectangle one a pretty simple one

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
we need to actually make a new file for

166
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
this tool to work

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,919
then open up the tool

168
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,240
select which board we want to penalize

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
on the left side we have all those

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
settings in a nice graphical user

171
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
interface

172
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
on the bottom there is those settings as

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,720
json representation and on the top you

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
have that if you want to run it from the

175
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
command line so you can do that tool

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,960
interactively and on the command line

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
so just hit penalize

178
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
and there's our panel

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
i'm going to show that in the 3d view

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,160
take some time on that machine

181
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
and this is how it looks so we have a

182
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
panel with some tabs and mouse bytes in

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
it

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
but there are some parts missing because

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
i put in the wrong settings so we're

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
going to change those i'm going to

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
change the spacing between the pcbs a

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
little bit

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,199
and also change the way how the tool

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
stands for which parts go on the panel

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
and hit penalize again it replaces what

192
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
we already had

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
we get a new panel and you can probably

194
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
see that there are some more connectors

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,759
on it

196
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
once the gl player decides it wants to

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,719
work

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,800
here we are so there are now a few more

199
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
parts on there and this is our finished

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
panel

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
you can configure

202
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
also not this type of panel routing you

203
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
can also include v-scoring

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,440
at tooling holes

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
fiducials and everything that's required

206
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
for proper pcb assembly so there's lots

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,639
of options to that tool

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,759
it has a great documentation so

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,360
one of the best documented tools i

210
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
actually know so

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
look into there to see what it can do

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,400
next is also key kit

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,639
it's the step after that so

214
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
when we have our panel we want to

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
generate production data so export

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
gerber files

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,639
you can do that manually

218
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,280
in in keycard but you can also automate

219
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
that and good reason for automating that

220
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
is making less mistakes and also you can

221
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,599
have presets for different manufacturers

222
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,120
because there's

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,399
different ways on how those gaba files

224
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
should be

225
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,120
called and there's naming conventions

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
and there

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
you can script that

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,599
so

229
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
on the command line call key kit

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
i put in the fab pcb way that's a preset

231
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
that is in there

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
and then we look into the out directory

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
and there are our gerber files already

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
as simple as that and we can view them

235
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
and

236
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
then we will see that there is the panel

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
of our gerber files

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
this is the panel we had earlier

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
uh

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
exported with the correct settings to

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
order them on pcb away there are presets

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
for a few different manufacturers but

243
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
you can also do your own

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
and reuse them every time you make a

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
board

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,279
so

247
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
we talked a lot about boards now so

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
another tool we need is

249
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
one for generating footprints

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
so

251
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
quite a lot of footprints are tedious to

252
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
make manually because they had a lot of

253
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,160
pins

254
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
we have an example here this thing has

255
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,480
42 pins placing them all one by one is

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,399
definitely not something one would do so

257
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
let's automate that

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
to do that we need to look at the

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
mechanical drawing and figure out where

260
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
those things are and where they go

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
so we check the other page of the data

262
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,680
sheet where we have all the measurements

263
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
and how big the part is how big the

264
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,880
landing pads are and so on

265
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,079
um

266
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,519
and then we punch them into a yaml file

267
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,079
so i prepared that so there's already

268
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,480
the finished yaml file so you see that

269
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
there are a lot of numbers in that file

270
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
that are basically the same that are in

271
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
the datasheet

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
i think all the

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
things are pretty self-explanatory but

274
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,920
there's also great documentation for

275
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,160
this generator

276
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
so what we do next we just run it

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
it says it's building the footprint it

278
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
has generated that one and now we can

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,800
open it up in the footprint editor

280
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
and that's it there's our generated

281
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
footprint actually typing in all those

282
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
numbers took me like a few minutes

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,839
um

284
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,680
but now comes the interesting part if

285
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
you want to make variations of that you

286
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,360
can just copy paste it edit it and

287
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
what i'm going to show next is we're

288
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
going to change the amount of wires in

289
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
there

290
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
as an example

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
so i go over here remove

292
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
one setting for the wires enable another

293
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,959
one

294
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,720
save that

295
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
run the generator again

296
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
and then we're gonna have a look at the

297
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
changed output of the generator

298
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,360
that one should have only three wires

299
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
like so

300
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,519
um and if you look at that in the 3d

301
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
view we can also see that the paste

302
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
which is the gray part doesn't overlap

303
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
the wires so we probably have less paste

304
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
leakage when soldering so it's most

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,439
likely a better footprint

306
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
this generator can not only do this

307
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
types of footprints that i just shown so

308
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
this is a qfn footprint

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
can do various other types of packages

310
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
as long as they are

311
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
reasonably sane so

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
there are quite a lot of packages out

313
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
there that have not a regular pin

314
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
spacing

315
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,680
and simple

316
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
odd pad shapes

317
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
the generator cannot do that but you can

318
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
probably like do half the work with the

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
generator and then edit the rest of the

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,160
stuff manually

321
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
next tool is actually not directly

322
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,279
related to pcbs but to your whole

323
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
assembly because

324
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
what you need to do in most cases is

325
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
actually not have a pcb but also connect

326
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
it up to lots of other things so you

327
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
need wires

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
and

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
it's nice to document them

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
and you can do that with wire with and

331
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,079
in a

332
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,760
in a similar way that we've seen with

333
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
the footprint generator

334
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
you can type in how your wiring harness

335
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
should look like

336
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
so in this example we have two

337
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
connectors

338
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
at the top then we define one cable

339
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
between those connectors

340
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,320
and

341
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
the third block at the bottom is how

342
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,000
those are connected

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,079
we run

344
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,000
true.generator and get a visualization

345
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
like this

346
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
there

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
yeah

348
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,839
i have another example for that that

349
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,600
looks a little bit more fancier has more

350
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,760
colors more pins

351
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
you can do that with

352
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
multiple connectors so it's not just

353
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
limited to two on each end

354
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,560
so there's basically no limits on

355
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
how complicated your cable should look

356
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,079
like you can also include pictures in

357
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,320
there for documentation

358
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
of how the plug looks

359
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,160
add more text

360
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
and so on

361
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
this tool also has a pretty nice

362
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
documentation there's lots of examples

363
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,120
you can look up for inspiration

364
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
i totally recommend using that

365
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,639
yeah and now i think it's time for

366
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,120
clement to show you a few other tools

367
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
so

368
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
right so the next tool we're going to

369
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
look at is keycat step up

370
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,920
and this is an enormously complex piece

371
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
of software which does horrible things

372
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
behind the scenes to make your life

373
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
easier

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
so it is a plug-in for freecad and

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,720
freecad is a parametric 3d graphics 3d

376
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
modeling editor

377
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
for solid modeling and solid cad

378
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,120
and what kicad step-up does is it can

379
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
read and write keycap files

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,800
of all like currently usable versions

381
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
which is a ridiculous maintenance effort

382
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
but it's it's amazing that it exists

383
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,399
because you can do really cool things

384
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
with it so we're going to take a

385
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
footprint that was just generated and

386
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,800
make a 3d model for it so we have this

387
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,079
footprint

388
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
but it has no 3d model and this is the

389
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
case for many footprints

390
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
in the kicad library and all footprints

391
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
that you've just freshly generated

392
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
yourself

393
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
so we're going to import that into gcad

394
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
using kicad step up mod

395
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
so we're going to load the footprint

396
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
and i'm loading the pcb here this is

397
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
this is a mistake it should be the

398
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,480
footprint but in this case it just does

399
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
the right thing

400
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,600
uh yeah so this is our footprint

401
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,639
and

402
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
we're going to then design a model on

403
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,040
top of it and this is now the standard

404
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
free cat design process

405
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
which is like where

406
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
we're building basically a sketch and

407
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
then

408
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
extruding that sketch

409
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
so i'm making a rectangle here and you

410
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,560
then look on the datasheet and check

411
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
those dimensions and enter those in here

412
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
so this one is supposed to be four

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
and then

414
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
the height of it is supposed to be one

415
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
so we're going to extrude it to one

416
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
millimeter

417
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
and then we're going to add a pin one

418
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,000
indicator in the top left

419
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
so that's the orientation that the

420
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
footprint was in kitkat

421
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
and then we can use the edges we just

422
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,639
added as reference

423
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,639
and mark the distances from from the

424
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,880
edge

425
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,279
yeah and then the size of that circle

426
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
which is usually not specified but you

427
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
can also do it by eye

428
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,839
yeah and then we're going to change the

429
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
color and really nice thing about using

430
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
pre-cut for this kind of work is that

431
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,199
you can actually get a screenshot from

432
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
your data sheet and insert it as an

433
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
image plane have that in the background

434
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,440
and kind of make your 3d model match so

435
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,279
even if the dimensions on the drawing

436
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,720
are not really well documented you can

437
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
still kind of fudge them into the right

438
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,240
place and

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,519
get the model that's good enough for

440
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
mechanical testing so i'm exporting this

441
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
as a step file now

442
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,279
and

443
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
then on the keycap side

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,559
i go in there and add a 3d model

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
so i find that file

446
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,240
and then we have a 3d model on our part

447
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,599
yep

448
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
so that's one of many many things you

449
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,679
can do with kitkat step up

450
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
i'll show you two more

451
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,960
so

452
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
uh we're going to take a board

453
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,760
which is just a really boring rectangle

454
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
and we want to make it fit around the

455
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
common household object the hacker camps

456
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,280
which is this mata bottle

457
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
which is slightly correctly measured i

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
do have a data sheet for a math bottle

459
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,320
but i was too lazy to type in all the

460
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
correct dimensions

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
so we're going to import our board

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,000
using the load board function

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,520
and it's going to complain that it's

464
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,679
missing some parts but that's fine

465
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,400
right

466
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
and

467
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,919
then we're going to take this bottle

468
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
and copy it and paste it into that file

469
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
and then we're going to change its

470
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
position to get it where we want it to

471
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,039
be

472
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
so what we want to do here is make a

473
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
board that is much nicer shaped and

474
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
that then fits around the bottle without

475
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
any additional support

476
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
so we're going to place the bottle in

477
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
the board where it's supposed to go

478
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
and then we're going to change the shape

479
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
of the board

480
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
so i'm hiding the board itself and

481
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
showing just its outline which is also

482
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,280
imported from the keycad file

483
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
and i'm going to delete that because i

484
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
don't need it anymore but i know where

485
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,720
the parts on it are like i can still see

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
the circuits that are on there

487
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
now i'm just going to use the arc tool

488
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,640
to make some

489
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
nice looking shapes

490
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,840
and drawing this kind of shape in kicad

491
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
is possible but extremely painful

492
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,919
so

493
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
it's not it's not something you

494
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
really want to be doing and in freecad

495
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,919
it's really really easy so i'm using the

496
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
tangent tool to now align all the curves

497
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
so they all line up

498
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
and then i can

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
drag them around to make them

500
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
have the shape that i imagine for this

501
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,799
and like this this board only has one

502
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,400
part on it if you have a bunch of parts

503
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,919
on it you can also see like okay we

504
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,919
cannot move things around there because

505
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,200
then there won't be enough space for the

506
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
parts and

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
things like that

508
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,640
so

509
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,360
now we're adding a cutout for the bottle

510
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
now we this is a 2d view but we can

511
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,799
actually rotate it in 3d

512
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
and

513
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
use that to adjust

514
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
just that to make it fit exactly that

515
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,840
spot on the bottle

516
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
so then we can now take this and then

517
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,760
push that sketch to a pcb

518
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
and this will actually override our

519
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
kicad file

520
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,678
with the with the new shape

521
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,400
so then over here

522
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,880
we need to actually close this file

523
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
and

524
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,919
open it again because it's now been

525
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,240
edited outside of keycap

526
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,480
and now we can remove the old outline

527
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,679
and we have this one

528
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
so yeah that's how that works and i'll

529
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,520
show you another thing

530
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
this is actually more like a free cat

531
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
feature in itself

532
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,400
uh and

533
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
this is we're going to take a board and

534
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,559
fold it and you might be wondering why

535
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,799
you want to fold the pcb but there is

536
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
there is a thing called flexible pcbs so

537
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
you can actually make pcbs that bend

538
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,559
and

539
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
it's very hard to actually check whether

540
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
those are correct without actually

541
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
bending them

542
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
so before discovering this tool i would

543
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,159
just print them out on paper and bend

544
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,039
them

545
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,320
but

546
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
it can now be done in cad

547
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
so freecad has this tool called sheet

548
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,720
metal workbench

549
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,840
and with that you can take a board so

550
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
this is a board also imported the same

551
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
way

552
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
so i've hit on the board and just have

553
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,159
the outline

554
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,280
and

555
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,480
i've added a line to it and i can bend

556
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,960
around that line

557
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,679
and you can you can you can put in a

558
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
bunch of bends and

559
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
like make it go any direction any angle

560
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
any turn radius so this for example is

561
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
um

562
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,520
this is just simple

563
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
pcb cable made to

564
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
to fit between two parts of a very small

565
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
device

566
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
so this is how you verify that that it

567
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,240
actually fits

568
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,080
so another tool this is uh a

569
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,520
kick out plugin

570
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
code replicate layout

571
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
and it

572
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
is there to save your time and effort

573
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
when you're doing a lot of the same

574
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
thing

575
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
so for example we have a

576
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
complex design here with a lot of

577
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,919
hierarchical sheets each one has an hdmi

578
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
connector which has a bunch of

579
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,120
high-speed connections and some

580
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
esd diodes

581
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,600
and i've painstakingly done the routing

582
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,200
for the exit from the connector in here

583
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
and i don't want to do it eight more

584
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
times

585
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,039
so

586
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,640
what i do i i select the connector

587
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
and go to replicate layout and it finds

588
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,760
all the sheets in the schematic that

589
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,080
match this one and i can select any

590
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
number of them

591
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,080
and then go replicate layout and it will

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,919
place the parts and connect them in

593
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,760
exactly the same way

594
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,679
and this this saves such an enormous

595
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,480
amount of effort

596
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
so yeah don't repeat yourself make the

597
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720
computer do it

598
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,760
right

599
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,360
over to you for the next one yes

600
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
so the next one is called pcb checklist

601
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
it's actually not really a tool it's

602
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,559
just a list somebody made with a list of

603
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
all the different types of mistakes you

604
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
can make when designing a circuit board

605
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
so what you can do is go through the

606
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
list and make sure you don't repeat them

607
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,919
um

608
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
i think all mistakes i had on circuit

609
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
spot so far on my own were actually

610
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
already on that list if i just had

611
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
followed that list i would not have made

612
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
them

613
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
here's an example of just the top of the

614
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
schematic review checklist

615
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
i didn't count how many points are in

616
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
there but this is

617
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
perhaps is

618
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,159
like a fifth of the complete list

619
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,320
perhaps less there's one for schematic

620
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,919
review and one for a pcb review

621
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,679
i highly recommend you check this one

622
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
out and

623
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
if you find something that's not on the

624
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,400
list then open a pull request and ask to

625
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,279
add it to that one

626
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,480
and

627
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
that brings us to the last tool um

628
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,159
git

629
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
so

630
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,240
keycard was designed

631
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,880
to have its projects tracked in git so

632
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
there's actually a lot of

633
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
design and engineering work in the file

634
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,360
format so it's produces nice diffs when

635
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,799
using it

636
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
for example most files have a stable

637
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
sorting there's a few things that don't

638
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
work too well right now but uh

639
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
it's it's really good i would say um

640
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
so if you change just a few items like

641
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
text move one part around also you can

642
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
actually read that in the diff and see

643
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
what has happened

644
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
so i highly recommend you

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
manage all your keycard projects in git

646
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,880
and

647
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
that already brings us to the end of the

648
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
tools we wanted to show you today

649
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,919
we have one more slide with all the urls

650
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,039
to all the tools we showed you today

651
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
we are also going to upload

652
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,039
those slides in pre-talks so

653
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,360
you can look them up over there

654
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,000
and follow those links

655
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,360
and yeah this was just like a small

656
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
introduction so we selected those tools

657
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
that are the easiest to show and that

658
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
bring the most value to like the average

659
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,200
user but there are quite a few more

660
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
so

661
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,279
just search around there's uh for

662
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,960
example the keycard iic channel

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,679
or there's a keycard forum and lots of

664
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
people hang around that have created

665
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,440
lots of more different tools and

666
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,799
workflows

667
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,039
for keycard

668
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,840
so

669
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
thank you i think we're ready to accept

670
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
some questions

671
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,320
thank you very much both um if anyone

672
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
has any questions there are two audience

673
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
microphones in the center aisle uh so

674
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,880
please wander up to there and ask them

675
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,039
hello my name is axel roost i have a

676
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,919
question about the interactive html bomb

677
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
uh it seems to be like a tool that you

678
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,320
use over several days while

679
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
managing stuff

680
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
does it store the status of the check

681
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,600
boxes anywhere in a cookie or somewhere

682
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
or do you have to do it all the again

683
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,000
yes it does store the state i think in

684
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,799
the local storage of your browser so in

685
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,559
the demo that i showed you probably seen

686
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
that a few of those boxes were already

687
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
checked when i opened that thing up in

688
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
chromium that's because i recorded that

689
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
twice because i made a mistake the first

690
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,799
time but the state was saved cool thank

691
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
you

692
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,200
hi um so in in the same example in the

693
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,799
html thing

694
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
you had some leds lined up around some

695
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,960
shape

696
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
do you have an extension for that and a

697
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
plugin or did you do that manually

698
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,440
okay there's uh actually also an action

699
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,080
plugin in the plugin and content manager

700
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,679
that helps you to distribute parts

701
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,440
around the board also in like for

702
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
example polar coordinates or rectangular

703
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,120
uh in that specific case it follows a

704
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,159
rather complex bca cool outline

705
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,960
so what i did is i planned it up in

706
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
mechanical cad exported those layers

707
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,679
into keycard and manually moved the leds

708
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,440
to the exact position

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
it's only 32 so it was doable

710
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,080
yeah you can of course write the script

711
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
to do it because there's a python api

712
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,720
for gigab yeah if it would be like more

713
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
than 32 i would probably have scripted

714
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
that

715
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,240
okay if there are no more questions um

716
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
that brings us to a close go forth and

717
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
use your new keycap abilities for good

718
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
or at least morally dubious purposes um

719
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
oh there's another hello yes

720
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
so uh if people don't have uh you folks

721
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,320
to point them out to these kinds of

722
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
things what can we do to kicad to make

723
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,760
all these things more obvious

724
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,200
not hide the plugin and content manager

725
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
okay you you can also join the

726
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,279
documentation team so keycard is like

727
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,200
the project is always looking for people

728
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,840
to help and for example if you open the

729
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
current menu there are actually quite a

730
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
few spots where it says like kind of to

731
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
do document this write down how it's

732
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
going to be used

733
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,559
any help there is welcome

734
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,799
okay

735
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,760
cool that's uh that's it for the stage

736
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
for the rest of the evening so thank you

737
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,200
very much for coming and thank you
