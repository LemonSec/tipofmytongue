2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,520
good evening thank you all for taking

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
your time to being here with me tonight

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
um and also welcome to the people on the

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
stream this talk is about the amiibo

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
anchor lock

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,199
i have one of these logs in my

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,880
collection i'm a bit of a lock collector

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,439
i used to be a chairman of tool as well

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,200
and of course i'm a hacker like most of

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,160
you

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
and i like to figure out how stuff works

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
and i thought a few years ago already

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
how does this

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
specific lock work because it's quite

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
special in that it uses magnets

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
so i set up on a trip on figuring out

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
about this particular lock and this talk

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000
the next 50 minutes i will tell you

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
about what i've tried to do with the

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
lock where i failed what not many people

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
will tell you nowadays when we all have

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
instagram but i will tell you all the

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
failures and all the successes as well

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,040
i probably don't have enough time to

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
have a real uh to have questions in

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
between if you have any questions maybe

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
we have some time at the end or

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
otherwise you can find me outside after

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
the talk

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
so i have this background tool

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,040
and i also have to say i'm writing a

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
book together with a few friends about

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,720
log sport

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
so this cylinder the anker 3800 or miwa

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
3800 that originated was invented in

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
japan as miwa it is sold in the

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
netherlands as anker

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
this is a view from the inside and you

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
see that this log has

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
four pins which you will find in many

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,240
regular locks that you will find on the

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
door but also here above the pins we

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,320
have

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
sliders with magnets in them and that

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,759
makes this

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
a special kind of cylinder

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
now here you see the key

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
and on the bottom of the key there are

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
these indents the bitting of the key and

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,759
you can see that they match for the four

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,199
pins that are inside the cylinder so

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,319
and on the other side of the key we see

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
eight black squares those are four sets

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
of two magnets

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,720
and those are samarium cobalt magnets

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,040
and they can also be fakes so some of

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
these black blobs are magnets and some

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
of them are fakes

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,200
and these magnets make tiny little

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
sliders in the cylinder move

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
and they need to move to the correct

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
spot to open

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,519
right so here again you see a blown up

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
version where you can clearly see that

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
the

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
what did i do the wrong button

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
where you can see that the sliders

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
go from left to right within the plug

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
and they are operated by the magnets

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
that you can see here in the key and on

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
the bottom these pins are operated

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
now the pins i'm not really going into

74
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
lock picking

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
you can go to other talks or to visit

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
the tool village here at the campsite

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
but for lock picking

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
or for the the pins they need to be

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
aligned at the shear line so the length

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
of the red pins need to match the cuts

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
in the key and when they're all

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
perfectly aligned

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
the

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
plug is free to rotate

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,000
well that's not the interesting part the

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
interesting part is those magnets so we

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
have here the four sliders

88
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
that can slide

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
in this orientation they slide up and

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
down

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,239
and

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,000
so you see there's

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,799
four sets of two magnets in the key that

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,480
one set per slider

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
um

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
now i then did some photoshopping to

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
create this wonderful slide so i think

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
this is my photoshop achievement

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,799
unlocked although it's a bit crappy but

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,799
i'm not a designer i'm a hacker on the

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
left you see the closed lock and you can

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
see that the pin is not at the shear

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
line and also you see this

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
yellow

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,959
slider

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
it it protrudes into the

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
edge of the cylinder so that's why it

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,879
won't open and there's a little spring

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
on top

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
and this green and red thing that's the

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
magnet

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
and on the right you see it with the

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
correct key inserted

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,240
so the key pushes the pin to the correct

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,199
depth

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
and also the magnets in the key

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
will

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
interact with the magnets in the slider

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
moving it away to the right

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
freeing up the plug

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
so that's basically how it works

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
and here you see that in this

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
so i said there are pairs of magnets but

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,720
in this case there's only a magnet on

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,960
one side of the key

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,919
and that is actually quite normal

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
here you see a key with a piece of

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
magnetic paper on top of it and you can

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
clearly make out that there is magnets

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,360
in there and i can even also tell that

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
the bottom two they are either facing

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
north up or south up and the upper two

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
they are

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
facing left or right

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
so there are different orientations of

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
magnets and that is what creates the key

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
in this the the code in this key

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,639
and of course you need at least one

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,720
magnet per slider to operate the slider

140
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
if you would use a

141
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
incorrect key

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
then

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
maybe the bidding is incorrect which

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,759
means that some pins are sticking out

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
or you have the incorrect magnets which

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
means that the sliders are sticking out

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
so they all need to be

148
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
correct

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
for everything to align within the plug

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
and the plug to rotate

151
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,960
right so this is a the theory um how

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
this lock works so i hope that is all

153
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
clear now let's look at defeating this

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
lock so what about picking can we pick

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
this cylinder well the four pins that

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
are in there they're just for pins and

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,880
you could

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
lock pick them with

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
regular picking techniques

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
and actually there's only four of them

161
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
whereas most common locks have five so

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
that should be easier but then there's

163
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
also these magnets

164
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,759
now these magnets can also be

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
manipulated if you take a piece of metal

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,720
and

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
glue a small magnet on the end of it you

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
can insert in the lock and wiggle it and

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
manipulate these sliders

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
and the sliders will move inside of the

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
cylinder and you can also use audio

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
magnification to make it easier to to

173
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
figure out what is happening and open

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
this lock

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
this is not easy when i started my

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,039
research which was already quite a few

177
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,240
years ago

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
i had not seen anybody open this

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
cylinder before

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
but

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
later on

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
i found well here's at least four videos

183
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,639
on youtube where you can figure out

184
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
where you can see this lock actually

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
being picked by hand

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
but there's only a few videos so that

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
already tells you that this is very hard

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,680
lock to lockpick because of those

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
magnets and and

190
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
the oldest videos are about two years

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,000
old that i found

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,960
so what i did was i took an old cylinder

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,199
and i

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,840
made a test cylinder out of it so in one

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
side i only kept the pins and the other

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
side i only kept the

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
magnetic sliders to

198
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
to work with this and my first thought

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
was can we duplicate the key

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
because you cannot just duplicate such a

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
key you need

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
to call to the factory to get it

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
duplicated you need to have a

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,759
certificate but if you have a key can

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
you make a copy

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,520
and of course you need to

207
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
read out the magnets

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
so we need some kind of device to

209
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
measure the magnetic field

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039
now i'm quite an old hacker so

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,039
i like to do electronics real ultra

212
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
stuff electronics i have a talk about

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
the gigatron tomorrow night but it's a

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
different story so i made this i found

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
this on the internet and i made a

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
magnetometer

217
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
so here's a device that you can use

218
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,039
to measure magnetic fields

219
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
and as you can see here i can read out

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
the magnets and you will see that some

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,599
magnets are orientated left right

222
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
and some of them are up down

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
oh that's not true in this particular

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,199
key they are all

225
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,919
left right oriented and you can also see

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
that for for each pair there's only one

227
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
that is an actual magnet the other one

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
is fake

229
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
okay reading the

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
magnets done my electronic batch is in

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
the pocket

232
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
but now i need to create a duplicate key

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
with these magnets

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
now the blank keys are cannot be

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
obtained

236
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
so i cannot start off with a blank key

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,279
and and put a magnet and make it fit

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
the magnets are made by factory and i

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
believe it is in france or spain or

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,839
somewhere

241
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
and the only

242
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,760
company in the netherlands that has

243
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,720
these is the anchor factory itself

244
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
and they won't just give you a key

245
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
maybe if you're very good in social

246
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,399
engineering

247
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
but anyway i thought i'd make a

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,000
magnet setup key so i take an existing

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
key

250
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,839
try to take out all the existing magnets

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,320
so i have holes in which i can put my

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
own magnets

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
so i used my dremel and i also took away

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
the bitting

255
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
and my idea was this key

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
is used to set the magnets

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
and then i can use this slit in between

258
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
to pick

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
the pins

260
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
because uh yeah i cannot form an

261
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
existing key i cannot make another

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
bitting of another key so i thought well

263
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
let's make a key with the magnets and do

264
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
picking

265
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
well that was also an epic fail because

266
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
there there's so little room inside this

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
cylinder that i just could not put my

268
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
pick in the

269
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
in the lock

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
and uh yeah not disturb pins that i did

271
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
not want to move

272
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
so that was a fail

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
but nevertheless i proceeded i i bought

274
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
some two by two by two millimeter

275
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
magnets

276
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,079
um

277
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,680
and um

278
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
yeah i tried to make the setup key

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
anyway

280
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,720
because i wanted to do yeah i still was

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
trying to learn more stuff but this just

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
didn't work i'm not very good at metal

283
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,240
work it appears and it was too steep a

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
learning curve for me i didn't have the

285
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,600
right equipment

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,720
so the setup key thing was going nowhere

287
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
it failed

288
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
so i thought

289
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
how else well let's let's forget about

290
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,839
these magnets for a while uh let's

291
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
suppose that we can create a key with

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
the correct magnets let's suppose i find

293
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
somebody who can do the metal stuff and

294
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,640
create this empty key for me

295
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
if i have it

296
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
what do i do with the bidding how do i

297
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
copy the bidding

298
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
well i also

299
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
do have

300
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
some equipment to make

301
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
copies of keys by using molding

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
so you take some putty you put in the

303
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,040
key

304
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
it makes a

305
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
you get a mold you pour in molten metal

306
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,390
and you have a copy

307
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,399
[Music]

308
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
you see a mold i made of an existing key

309
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
so now my idea was if i have a

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
setup key with the correct magnets i

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,320
need to put in this bitting that you see

312
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
here

313
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
and this is how i did it

314
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
so the setup key i combine with the mold

315
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
of the key i want to copy

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
i pour in metal and this is the result

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
does it work

318
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,839
yeah achievement unlocked

319
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,360
of course this is the cylinder that only

320
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
has the pins and not the sliders because

321
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
i didn't

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
succeed in making the setup key

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
but this proves that if i have a setup

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
key i could copy the

325
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,730
bidding

326
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,959
[Music]

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,959
so to duplicate a key we could make a

328
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,920
skeleton key from the existing key

329
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
but that's quite frustrating also

330
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
even if i could get this empty key with

331
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
the holes to put the magnets in the

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
magnets that i bought are two by two by

333
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
two millimeters and the key is only 2.1

334
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
millimeters thick

335
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
if you have only point one millimeter

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
left you yeah it becomes really horrible

337
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
to work with

338
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
and this was a state of affairs

339
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,360
in at lok con 2019 just before kovit and

340
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
i thought well

341
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
the only solution i see to get it to get

342
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
to advance is to do 3d printing but i

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
didn't have a 3d printer

344
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
and

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,880
yeah i left the project

346
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
i abandoned it

347
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
but then came covert

348
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
and i had time

349
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,320
and i also had a little bit of money

350
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,519
left to buy myself a

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,320
present which is this creality halo

352
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,920
printer this is a resin printer because

353
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,480
i thought because of the really tight

354
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
tolerances i needed a very a printer

355
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
that could make really my new details

356
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
i bought this printer and i thought and

357
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
i was still somehow stupid of me in the

358
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
mode of i need to get that setup key

359
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
so what i did was i made a setup key

360
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,600
with the slit to do the picking which i

361
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
already knew didn't work anyway

362
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
and i but this was fun because i needed

363
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,519
to learn about

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,800
openscad

365
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,600
and

366
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,639
design

367
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
so again achievement unlocked i was able

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,279
to create a 3d model of this key

369
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,800
and this has a slit to allow for picking

370
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
and this is actually maybe the the

371
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
second or third thing i printed on this

372
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
printer so i was really chuffed

373
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,199
it did need a little bit of filing to

374
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
make it really fit because the

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
measurements were a little bit a little

376
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
bit off

377
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
but as you can see the magnets did fit

378
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
it didn't break

379
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
and best of all it does work on my

380
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
cylinder that has just the magnets

381
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,079
so the proof of concept is i can make

382
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,560
this key

383
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
still a tiny problem of the slit where i

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
cannot put in my picking tool without

385
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
yeah

386
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,959
doing anything

387
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,839
but i first i i fixed my model to make

388
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
it more to make it fit better so this is

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
a

390
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
somewhat later key and this fits right

391
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
away after printing

392
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
but i still had that problem in the

393
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
meantime i had learned from those

394
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,199
youtube videos which were made

395
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,800
after i picked this project up again in

396
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
kovit

397
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
i find out that the pins are first to

398
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
bind in many locks with different rows

399
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
of pins of different elements

400
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,199
you need to pick one row first

401
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,240
then the

402
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,839
lock will rotate slightly and then you

403
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
need to pick another one the the second

404
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,360
row of pins

405
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
now in this particular lock you need to

406
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
pick the pins first then it will rotate

407
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
a little bit and then you need to

408
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,160
put the sliders in the correct position

409
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,199
so i can actually by applying tension in

410
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
the middle of the lock and using a

411
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
picking tool i can pick the four pins

412
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
and when the four pins have been picked

413
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,839
i can use the setup key that i made by

414
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
copying the magnets from the original

415
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,959
key

416
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
i can insert it

417
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,680
and

418
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
keep the tensioner in place and that

419
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
would open the lock

420
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
and i tried this and i picked the lock

421
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
and actually it was

422
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
much harder than i had anticipated

423
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,199
but

424
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,760
achievement unlocked i did open it but

425
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,639
this is not really something that a

426
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
non-professional lock picker would

427
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,920
easily do

428
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
also the pins in this lock

429
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
are anti-picking pins which makes it

430
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,880
more difficult to pick them

431
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,639
yeah but as i said um

432
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
oh so the attack factor that we have up

433
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,920
till now is if i have access to a key

434
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
even temporary i can read out the

435
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,639
magnets i can create a setup key i can

436
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
pick the pins and open it

437
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,360
but of course why am i not just 3d

438
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
printing the bidding i was really stuck

439
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
on my original train of thoughts of

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
do continuing what i was doing but of

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
course you can just print the bidding i

442
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
mean that's no no biggie

443
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,600
so i

444
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
updated my model and you can now

445
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,800
create a bidding in there as well

446
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
and

447
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
yeah you can just type in another code

448
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,199
and as you can see

449
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,839
it will

450
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,600
change another bidding so you can just

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
type in the number of the

452
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
the code of the bidding that you want to

453
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,839
have

454
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,279
and you create a key

455
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,000
so

456
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
with that here's a such a key that has

457
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,680
been printed

458
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,680
and it does work on both sides

459
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,079
so now we can actually

460
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,839
create a copy of course you also need to

461
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,519
know what the bidding is but

462
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
there's only four pins and the depth of

463
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
these pins there's only four

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
possibilities

465
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
so that's not much

466
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
in many locks you will have seven or

467
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,240
maybe nine possibilities and then you

468
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
really have to measure quite well to see

469
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,440
which

470
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,680
which depth it is but in the anchor it's

471
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
only four

472
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,480
and if you've been doing this for a bit

473
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
of time you can do this with a naked eye

474
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
if you give me an anchor key i can see

475
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
with the naked eye what the depth

476
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,799
are

477
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,640
so i can

478
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
put that in my open scat printer key and

479
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,919
have a duplicate so that's interesting

480
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
uh problem is a little bit that the keys

481
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,079
are very brittle

482
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
i once dropped the key from this height

483
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
and it broken too

484
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
and also you have to be careful inside

485
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,039
of the lock

486
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
uh so i also did have a key break inside

487
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
of the lock and it gave me very hard

488
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
time getting that key out again

489
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,039
so that's also why if you do these kinds

490
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
of experiments you do them on your own

491
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
cylinders that you don't use in a door

492
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,320
or somewhere where you rely upon them

493
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
so the keys are brittle so what to do

494
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
about that i thought about this and i

495
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
thought well if we make the magnets

496
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
smaller

497
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,880
there's more

498
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
surrounding material making the key more

499
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,080
sturdy so i did find some one by one by

500
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,200
one millimeter magnets now they are so

501
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
incredibly small that if you put them in

502
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
tweezers and you move them around they

503
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
will they will already flip it's

504
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
i gave up

505
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
and then i talked to a colleague of mine

506
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
at work about this uh hobby project and

507
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,039
he said

508
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
well why not to use disk magnets

509
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,480
and he actually already started on

510
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
printing on his printer a key and he

511
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,520
does not have a resin printer but a

512
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
filament printer

513
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
and as you can see here on the bottom

514
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
this is a key where the magnets are

515
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
cylindrical this means that some

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,960
cylinders some magnets need to go flat

517
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
and some magnets need to be

518
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
going deep inside of the key

519
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,760
but of course if you print a key on a

520
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
per use basis you can print it any way

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,799
you like so you just print it so it fits

522
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
the correct magnets

523
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
and what's even better you can leave out

524
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,799
the holes where you don't need a magnet

525
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,679
where we have these fake magnets which

526
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,280
will also

527
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
strengthen the key more

528
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
and

529
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
i was worried about the filament print

530
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
or not being able to make the key

531
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
with such tolerances that it would work

532
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,559
but actually it does work flawlessly

533
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
so that's about key copying

534
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
but another kind of attack is where you

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
want to gain an entry to a

536
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
or again entry open a lock where you do

537
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
not have the original key so this is not

538
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
about key copying but about

539
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
opening the lock decoding picking

540
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,799
whatever

541
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,080
now here again some wonderful

542
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
photoshopping and you see that the

543
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,960
key on the right has a magnet with north

544
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
facing up and this matches for this

545
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
slider

546
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
a magnet where north is facing

547
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,020
right

548
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,559
[Music]

549
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
and it always has to be the same if you

550
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
if you have this key this

551
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
type of magnet in the key you know what

552
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,520
needs to be in the

553
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
slider

554
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,900
to make it move in the correct direction

555
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,320
[Music]

556
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,880
and for each of these magnets there's

557
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
five possibilities north up north down

558
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
north to the left north to the right or

559
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,770
no magnet at all

560
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,600
[Music]

561
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
so here you see the arrows represent the

562
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,000
direction the sliders need to move so

563
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
two of them move right and two of them

564
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,480
move left and that's the same for every

565
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,679
cylinder

566
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,679
and here you see the magnets that i've

567
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
read out

568
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
and

569
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,600
i then know if i see this key i know

570
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,080
already that the lock must contain these

571
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
sliders

572
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
because if this key is inserted in this

573
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
specific lock

574
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
i know that is the only way that the

575
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,880
sliders will be

576
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
moved to the correct position

577
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,360
so knowing the magnets in the key

578
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
with that i will learn what the magnets

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
are in the cylinder

580
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
but it's also the

581
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
other way around if i know what is in

582
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
the cylinder

583
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
i then know what is in the key

584
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
so i wanted to read out the magnets in

585
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,360
the cylinder

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
so i use my

587
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
wonderful magnetometer try to read out

588
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
the magnets but yeah it doesn't fit the

589
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
sensor is too big

590
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,840
as i said this lock is a weird shape and

591
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
there's really not a lot of space

592
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
so this was a fail and um

593
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,640
i looked for smaller ones smaller hole

594
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,360
sensors and i found this in a soft 23

595
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,760
package which is rather small

596
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
i bought a few of them

597
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,559
and

598
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
then i needed to put this on something

599
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,330
to insert into the cylinder

600
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,679
[Music]

601
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,720
i then

602
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
tried the kicad to design a little pcb

603
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
just a flat piece of pcb that goes

604
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
inside of the cylinder

605
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
and

606
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,840
i bought some 0.4 millimeter flexible

607
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,760
pcb and i was told by somebody you can

608
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,919
so that's a keycard achievement

609
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
and somebody told me if you print your

610
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,280
keycard design with a laser printer on

611
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
inkjet paper and then use an iron you

612
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
can transfer it to the pcb and etch it

613
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
well for me this failed horribly i don't

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
know what i did wrong maybe some of you

615
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
know

616
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
come see me after the talk but i

617
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,480
reverted to a really old-school pcb

618
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
making which i've already done years and

619
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,039
years ago it's just using a sharpie and

620
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,320
drawing on it

621
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,039
and

622
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,039
making it so

623
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,919
that was

624
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
achieved but still failed because it

625
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,039
didn't fit

626
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,039
here you see on the bottom left you see

627
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,000
that the

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
sensor is on top of the pcb and together

629
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
with the pcb it was still too high

630
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
so the solution was to put this the

631
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,600
whole center at the end of the

632
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,080
pcb and glue it on

633
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,960
and for that i needed to extend the wire

634
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,039
so i used 0.1 millimeter wires and

635
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,600
soldered them on and this was the most

636
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,200
hard thing of the whole project

637
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
it was really frustrating but it did

638
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
work in the end so it was on it was

639
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,760
working

640
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,600
i used it with my magnetometer and it

641
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
failed because it uses different voltage

642
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
levels than the other wall sensor

643
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
so i needed to fix my electronics

644
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,840
but

645
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
i thought well let's learn some more

646
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
stuff let's do something with an arduino

647
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
i mean it's totally overkill for reading

648
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,679
out the whole sensor but it's fun anyway

649
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,159
so here you can see the device in action

650
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,080
so i can insert it i have to wiggle it a

651
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
little bit

652
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,039
in case the magnet is going left and

653
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
right

654
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,520
but you see i can actually read out the

655
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,840
the magnets that are in the cylinder

656
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
and what's interesting is that this lock

657
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
has quite a few magnets but we'll get to

658
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
that later

659
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
and since i was doing this anyway i

660
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
thought well let's make it more

661
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
beautiful so i ordered this

662
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
lcd touchscreen

663
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,039
and

664
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,200
i also programmed in that you can

665
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,120
that will translate from the magnets in

666
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
the key to the cylinder and vice versa

667
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
it has now an analog mode and a digital

668
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,360
mode to show what the magneti

669
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
magnetization is

670
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
there's an sd card in there so you can

671
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
save the current readout to the sd card

672
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
and here you see me reading out a

673
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
specific cylinder

674
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
and you see it will translate

675
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
automatically if the cylinder in this

676
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,840
position has this kind of magnet

677
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,640
then the key must have this other magnet

678
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,600
in that place

679
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,720
and now if i read out the original key i

680
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,120
should get what is depicted on the left

681
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,120
works great so i can now read out

682
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
the magnets in a cylinder

683
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
so the attack factor is if i have

684
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
temporary access to a cylinder

685
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
but not the key i can read out the

686
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
magnets and i can determine what magnets

687
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
need to be in the key

688
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
but i don't have the bitings so we still

689
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
i can make a setup key but i still need

690
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
to do the lock picking for the four pins

691
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
for one time opening with a lot of

692
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,080
effort

693
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
or i could make

694
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,360
all possibilities because it's only four

695
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,840
pins with four possibilities if i make

696
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,159
if i spend a few days and make 256 keys

697
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,080
i could try them out and one of them

698
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,480
will fit

699
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
so that's yeah do we have an alternative

700
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
instead of picking or creating 256 keys

701
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
so one of the ways that you can also

702
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,720
open a lock

703
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
one time is using bumping so i won't

704
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
explain everything with bumping but the

705
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,120
idea very shortly is that you

706
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,000
apply a lot of force to the pins that

707
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
transform that the force is

708
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,039
moved over to the other pins on the on

709
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,799
top they will

710
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
separate for short moment of time and in

711
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,200
that time you can open the lock

712
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
can we do bumping

713
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,320
now that's quite hard as well because

714
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,000
for bumping you need a bump key a bum

715
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,679
key is a key

716
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,679
where as you can see here in the in the

717
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,039
movie the the key is cut to the deepest

718
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,120
most position everywhere

719
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,240
but for this i need an existing key

720
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,919
and i also need to have the correct

721
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,679
magnets in there

722
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,960
um

723
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
so i could print a uh

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
so yeah i cannot get a blank key from

725
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
the factory

726
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
because i won't give it to anybody

727
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
but i can print the key well the resin

728
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,919
printed key is much too brittle so i if

729
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,880
i if i yeah smash it it will break

730
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
but fortunately the pat g key is strong

731
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,760
enough

732
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
so this is pad g on the filament printer

733
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,279
so i have the correct magnets that i've

734
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,799
read out

735
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,720
i use a bump

736
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
hammer

737
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,919
and of course i show you the video where

738
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,240
this works in one hit normally it would

739
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
take maybe five six seven eight hits

740
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
to open it it does require a bit of

741
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
practice to be able to do this but it

742
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,120
works and it did work repeatedly so the

743
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
key was not

744
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
it was still operational

745
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
for another bump

746
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
after i did this bump

747
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,760
so that's nice that gives me the

748
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,399
possibility to do a one-time opening

749
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
if i don't have the key

750
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
there's another way of finding the

751
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
bidding which is impressioning that's

752
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,120
also a very interesting topic that you

753
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
could also talk about for 50 minutes

754
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
instead maybe you can watch this video

755
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
by joel zveyers he did a great job on

756
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
attacking master keith systems how to do

757
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
that with impressioning with

758
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,600
impressioning you start with a key that

759
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,320
has all the pins in the top

760
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,000
maximum level

761
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
you wiggle it in the lock and it the the

762
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,480
the pins will make tiny marks on the key

763
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
so you need to have a key that has

764
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
rather soft material like brass not

765
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
steel

766
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
and you get tiny marks you need a

767
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
magnifying glass to see them and where

768
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,279
you see a mark you need to file away a

769
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,760
little bit of material until it yeah it

770
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,919
fits because if you if you file it to

771
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,799
the correct depth it will no longer mark

772
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,880
and here you see a lock so so there's a

773
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,159
key a dimple lock key that i impressions

774
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,600
and you see it looks a bit weird because

775
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,279
i filed straight over the key but it

776
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
doesn't matter as long as the place

777
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
where the pin drops goes to the correct

778
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
spot that is fine now can we do this for

779
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,640
the anchor well not with our 3d printed

780
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,760
keys i mean that material is not suited

781
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,120
for doing impressioning you need to

782
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
apply quite a lot of force and these

783
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,840
pins need to mark the key

784
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
so we need a brass

785
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
setup key

786
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,399
and we don't have those

787
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,360
setup key brass impressioning key

788
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
well i was talking to my colleague hido

789
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
about this project and he said oh but i

790
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,520
have a cnc machine maybe i can do

791
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,640
something for you

792
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,600
so

793
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
actually he did an aluminum key for me

794
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
as well so he and from that one he took

795
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
some pictures so here you see that he's

796
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,320
creating from a piece of

797
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
aluminum a or aluminium i should say

798
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
probably here

799
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
made a key with the

800
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,600
spaces to put the magnets in

801
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
and you can make this a bum key

802
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
or an impressioning key

803
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,880
and here's the impression key so this

804
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
was made out of brass

805
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,360
and on the bottom left you can see

806
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
that under the right lighting you can

807
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
see the marks that the pins make on the

808
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,159
key

809
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,399
and there you file away a little bit and

810
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
you try again so this is not something

811
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,559
that you can do in a few minutes it

812
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,360
takes

813
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,440
yeah several steps

814
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
and quite a bit of time

815
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
and

816
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
yeah did i achieve it yeah i achieved

817
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,799
impressing a a key to make it fit but i

818
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,640
feel i also kind of failed

819
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,840
because this was

820
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
very hard i mean i've done impressioning

821
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,760
in the past with regular locks and the

822
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,200
lock you saw before

823
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
that is way more easy than with this

824
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
particular lock i'm not really sure what

825
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
is the reason for that

826
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,600
maybe it's also the material used but i

827
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
found it very hard and it's

828
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,679
not really a

829
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,520
yeah a real life scenario i would say

830
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
but still we now have an attack factor

831
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
when you have access to the cylinder but

832
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,279
you don't have a key we can read out the

833
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,200
magnets

834
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,360
and we could create a set of key uh

835
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,120
with the deepest cuts to do a one-time

836
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
bump so you have opened it but you don't

837
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
know what the combination is

838
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,559
or if you're very experienced you might

839
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,240
be able to do impressioning which will

840
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
take

841
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
quite a bit of time but then you end up

842
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,120
with knowing the correct bitting so you

843
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
have an actual key

844
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,640
for a cylinder that you have not seen

845
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,600
the key

846
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
for before

847
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
now let's talk about something else

848
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,399
which is master keying because

849
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,360
the anchor lock is a high security lock

850
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
it was invented in the 1980s i think i

851
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,840
already mentioned it was patented in the

852
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,279
early 80s

853
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,799
the patent has been

854
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,360
is no longer valid by a long time

855
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,679
but they are used in in high security

856
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,200
environments like

857
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
hospitals

858
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,240
and such

859
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
and in those environments

860
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,960
they use master keying a lot and very

861
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,799
short introduction to master keying

862
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,799
master keying is where you have

863
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,440
cylinders that have that each have their

864
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
own key so you have a key that works on

865
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,600
your door in your office but you also

866
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
have a key that works on all the doors

867
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
on your floor or all the doors in your

868
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,080
building or all the doors on the site

869
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,760
but let's keep it simple and only look

870
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,720
at

871
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
i'll show you an example with just two

872
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,559
locks with two individual keys and one

873
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,039
third key that opens both of them how

874
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,159
does that work

875
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,039
in a traditional system

876
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,200
this is a traditional pin tumbler lock

877
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
master key so on the left is alice's

878
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
lock

879
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
and on the right is andy's lock

880
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,240
and here you see alice's key alice's key

881
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,120
will open alice's lock why because all

882
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,760
the pins are

883
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
all the pins

884
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,279
are

885
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,720
here

886
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
straight at the shear line

887
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
so that works but it doesn't work on

888
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,440
andy's lock because as you can see some

889
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
pins are still blocking so alice's key

890
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,480
only works on alice's lock

891
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,720
nd has a different key and here you can

892
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,559
see that andy's key will work on andy's

893
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,799
lock but it does not work on alice's

894
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,000
lock

895
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,840
so far so good

896
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,919
and now comes the special key

897
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,399
the master key or master key or

898
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
submaster key or whatever you call it

899
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
and this key will open as you can see

900
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,080
both locks

901
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,679
and you've also seen that the way they

902
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,039
do this is by cutting up the pins once

903
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,600
more so you have two possible depths

904
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
that will open

905
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,080
that will set that pin to the correct

906
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,360
position while there's two correct

907
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,039
positions

908
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,720
and what's also interesting to note is

909
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,640
that the master key that you see here on

910
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,000
top

911
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
in this case in this example differs in

912
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,360
two spots

913
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,600
and the master key always has more

914
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960
material on it than the individual user

915
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,559
keys

916
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,600
and

917
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,279
if you're a real hacker you will

918
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
probably figure this out but the reason

919
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,159
is that if you have the user key you

920
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,720
must not be able to create a mask key by

921
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,600
just filing away a little bit of stuff

922
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,120
so you can create an individual key by

923
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,559
the mask key by filing but that's not

924
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,720
really an attack factor

925
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
now if you translate that to

926
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
anker then you will see that also there

927
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
we have master keying in the pins

928
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,600
so the the the pin in red is a is

929
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,919
actually it's now lying flat but it is a

930
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
really thin

931
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,919
spacer and on the right middle right you

932
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,760
see the three different spaces that

933
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
exist with the depth of one two or three

934
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,679
and you also see the pins with depth one

935
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,360
two three four so with these you can

936
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,919
make all kinds of combinations

937
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,600
so for this

938
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,080
these pins in this cylinder is part of a

939
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,720
master key system and there is two

940
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
bittings that will

941
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,240
match to open the lock

942
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,719
so my naive thought

943
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
when i started this was to think well if

944
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,399
i have an existing key so let's get back

945
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,000
to the scenario where we do have a key

946
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,320
for a cylinder and we know it's master

947
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,359
keyed

948
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,199
and i have this key i know it's a user

949
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,079
key so i don't have much access

950
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,000
then well this must be the correct

951
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
position also for the

952
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,119
master key because otherwise the i could

953
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,199
file away stuff to get to the master key

954
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,839
which is against our rule and this pin

955
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,000
while the muskie might have one

956
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,359
of three other

957
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,440
uh positions there

958
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,839
and this one and we can try them out so

959
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,719
we

960
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,599
we

961
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
create we print three keys

962
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,000
and we can uh just

963
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,359
um alter one of the pin stack positions

964
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
so we keep three positions the same and

965
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,359
the other one we can vary

966
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,880
and we make three keys and we test them

967
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,760
all and maybe none of them work

968
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
that gives us information

969
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,040
and for the third key there's two more

970
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,359
possibilities and we print them and we

971
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,119
try them out and maybe only one works

972
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,760
and for the last one we print three

973
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,720
and also maybe one works

974
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
and naively speaking we would say well

975
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,640
it must be the highest positions for

976
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,760
every

977
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,359
for everyone that must be the master key

978
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,800
and we can print that and hopefully that

979
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,480
will open all of the logs

980
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,839
um

981
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
it is actually not true

982
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
oh yeah we can't copy these

983
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,640
but you can make these keys try them out

984
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,839
and get information about what

985
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,119
works but what's interesting is that we

986
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,599
do not have just the pins we also have

987
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,040
the magnets and that makes this look

988
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,880
much more interesting

989
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
and in the magnets we can also do master

990
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
keying because the magnets here you see

991
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,480
the the bottom of the

992
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,079
sorry the sliders the bottom of the

993
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,000
slider you see there's place for two

994
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
magnets also in the key we have place

995
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
for two magnets

996
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,680
and this we can use for master keying so

997
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
we can have a key with a magnet on the

998
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,960
left side and another key with a magnet

999
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
on the right side and the slider has

1000
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,599
magnets on both sides

1001
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,680
and that's really cool

1002
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
in this lock

1003
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,160
here's a key

1004
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,480
this is a key that's part of a master

1005
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
key system this is a user key

1006
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,880
if i have this key i can read out the

1007
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,040
magnets and i already know using my

1008
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
little device here

1009
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
it will tell me what magnets are in the

1010
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
cylinder

1011
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,079
so

1012
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,280
but

1013
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
uh when i

1014
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,560
let's go again so i know at least these

1015
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
are in the cylinder

1016
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,119
and but what is in the master key

1017
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,680
well what i can do is i can also read

1018
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
out

1019
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
the magnets in the cylinder in my door

1020
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
and maybe i will find find some extra

1021
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
magnets that are in the cylinder but

1022
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,440
they do not match anything in my key

1023
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240
now so that gives information

1024
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,160
so first of all i know that the master

1025
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,520
key

1026
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,920
the master key operates on my door

1027
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,320
so it must have the magnets

1028
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,839
to operate it must have magnets to

1029
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
operate each slider

1030
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,520
now there are two sliders the middle

1031
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,640
ones

1032
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
that only have one magnet so i know that

1033
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
the corresponding magnet must be

1034
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,119
in the master key

1035
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,560
so that is something i know for sure

1036
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,480
now there are also

1037
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
magnets that are in the master key

1038
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
that i did not find corresponding

1039
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,400
magnets in my key

1040
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,160
but there are in the master in the in

1041
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,880
the oh i said master right i the the

1042
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
magnets i found in the cylinder that are

1043
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
not matched on the key

1044
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,839
but they must be in the cylinder for a

1045
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,040
reason

1046
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,400
um

1047
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
i mean you could frustrate hackers and

1048
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,320
put in magnets that do not do anything

1049
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,400
but i'm pretty sure that's not the case

1050
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,320
so these magnets are there

1051
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
they are operated by some other key

1052
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,839
other than mikey so that must be the

1053
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,680
master key so the master key must have

1054
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,359
magnets that operate on the blue

1055
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,119
magnets in the cylinder

1056
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,520
what to do with these sliders

1057
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
that have two magnets so i still have

1058
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,640
the

1059
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,040
the north up here and i have the south

1060
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,119
up there

1061
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,119
should we put the corresponding magnets

1062
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,160
on the master key or not

1063
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,320
well i can give you

1064
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
an example that shows you that you

1065
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,720
should not

1066
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
so let's suppose that so this is the key

1067
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
we just saw

1068
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,160
and this is my cylinder

1069
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,079
but we all in this master key system we

1070
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,920
also have a different cylinder cylinder

1071
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,720
b

1072
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,640
with its own key

1073
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,520
key b and if you look closely you will

1074
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,640
see that key a does not open cylinder b

1075
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,000
and key b does not open cylinder a

1076
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
because

1077
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
here is a south

1078
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,960
matching the north south and here's the

1079
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
north

1080
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
matching the south north so they cannot

1081
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,839
be mixed

1082
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,079
if the master key would have a

1083
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,640
north south there or south north

1084
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,280
it would not open

1085
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,800
one of the keys

1086
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
so

1087
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
if we

1088
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
go to

1089
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
cylinder b

1090
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
read out the magnets in the key

1091
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
we find out that on the bottom left

1092
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
there's a north we know that in the mass

1093
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,079
key there should be no magnet that's

1094
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,000
something we learn

1095
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,800
and

1096
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,880
we also learn by reading out the second

1097
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,920
cylinder

1098
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,839
that it has a magnet that we had not

1099
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,320
seen before there's a on the on the

1100
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,760
second

1101
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,280
slider there's a north on the right

1102
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
and again this slider only has one

1103
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,280
magnet

1104
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,760
so the master key must operate that one

1105
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,079
magnet so in the key there must be the

1106
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
corresponding

1107
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
magnet southward

1108
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,480
and for the one on the top

1109
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,960
top left in the mast key we are not sure

1110
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,560
yet we do not have enough information

1111
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,839
it could be

1112
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,359
that there is no magnet in the master

1113
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,440
key or it could be that there is one but

1114
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
if there is one it must be a north south

1115
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,480
one

1116
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
to operate on these two cylinders

1117
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,319
so this is a process of

1118
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,240
looking at keys

1119
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,839
measuring the magnets measuring the

1120
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,359
magnets in the cylinder going to a

1121
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,560
different cylinder

1122
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,160
measuring the cylinder to a different

1123
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
cylinder and each time you see something

1124
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,640
that you haven't seen before you get

1125
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,200
more information to paint a complete

1126
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,880
picture of what the master key will look

1127
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,079
like

1128
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,880
as far as the magnets go

1129
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,040
and the last one the last magnet well we

1130
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
didn't see any magnets neither in the

1131
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,640
key or in the cylinder so we just don't

1132
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,200
know yet

1133
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
but you could make a key with these

1134
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
magnets and and see if it works as a

1135
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,720
master key

1136
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,319
and

1137
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,000
if it doesn't work you need to read out

1138
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,960
more cylinders

1139
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,520
so getting master key

1140
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,240
well

1141
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,200
the what i said before about filing away

1142
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
uh that was a bit naive also in in the

1143
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,160
anchor system because you have both pins

1144
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
and magnets

1145
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,079
that means that if you have a key

1146
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
that is that could be filed to the

1147
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,720
master key biting that's not an issue if

1148
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,640
the magnets are different because if you

1149
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
are an end user and you file away well

1150
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,079
you have you do not have the the

1151
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,800
capabilities to exchange the magnets

1152
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,119
at least i don't i don't have the cnc

1153
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,760
stuff

1154
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,040
um

1155
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,920
so if you take your key to another lock

1156
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,599
and you you wonder if it's the most key

1157
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,440
and it doesn't work well that's a bit of

1158
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,359
an issue you can read out the magnets in

1159
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,040
the cylinder to figure out what the

1160
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
correct magnets are but you cannot

1161
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,400
figure out what the correct bidding is

1162
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,920
so what do you need to do what you can

1163
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,640
do

1164
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,839
is to

1165
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,000
check all other possible

1166
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,480
uh biddings

1167
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
in the original

1168
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,000
lock so you have the first lock with

1169
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,119
your own key

1170
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
and for each pin

1171
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
you try the other three possibilities

1172
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,359
and that will give you information about

1173
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,119
all the possibilities that are present

1174
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,200
in the master key for the bidding

1175
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
and then you can make a whole lot of

1176
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,839
keys but not 256 but at most 80

1177
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,160
depending on the mastery system and try

1178
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,079
them out and try which fits in the

1179
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
second log

1180
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,079
so it's interesting um the more

1181
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,839
cylinders you see and the more cylinders

1182
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,240
you measure

1183
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,319
the better you are able to get the uh

1184
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,880
the master key or as i call it gold mode

1185
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,440
the key to all

1186
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
but it's surprisingly hard

1187
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,440
just and the reason is this combination

1188
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,359
of the pins and the magnets so i'm

1189
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,960
actually quite impressed with this

1190
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,599
system that is already 40 years old and

1191
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,880
it still has such a resistance against

1192
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,480
finding out the master key it certainly

1193
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,880
is a lot harder than with regular pin

1194
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,839
terminal locks only

1195
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,599
so let's summarize

1196
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,280
i may even have time for a few questions

1197
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,040
i see which is great

1198
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,119
summarizing here for the people who are

1199
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,160
more visually

1200
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
you start if you have a key

1201
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,599
if you don't have a key

1202
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,960
now let's start yeah let's start with

1203
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,560
not having a key you don't have a key

1204
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
then you can decode at least the magnets

1205
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,599
in the cylinder so you know which

1206
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,520
magnets are in the key

1207
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,319
then for the pins well either you can

1208
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
pick but that's very hard that's why

1209
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,520
it's in light blue i don't think that's

1210
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,119
really a realistic way of doing it

1211
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,880
you could bump i think bumping is quite

1212
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,280
realistic but then you have a one-time

1213
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,880
opening

1214
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,400
if you are able to do impressioning

1215
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,359
which is also very very hard you could

1216
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,839
get a working key so getting a working

1217
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,119
key

1218
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,480
without having one

1219
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
at start is very hard but

1220
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,640
opening once

1221
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,119
is for a very determined hacker doable

1222
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,880
if you already have a key an end user

1223
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,000
key a user key then you can decode the

1224
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,760
cylinder and the key gives you more

1225
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,079
information you can duplicate the key

1226
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,560
and if it is master keyed you can try

1227
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,720
with creating a lot of other well with

1228
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,800
the 12 keys find the other bittings and

1229
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,480
then you can go to other

1230
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,319
cylinders read them out

1231
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,280
and

1232
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
maybe you need to print quite a lot of

1233
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,520
keys but if you are persistent you will

1234
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,839
be able to in the end find the mast key

1235
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,040
but that is still quite hard

1236
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
now there's one thing i didn't really

1237
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,720
discuss which is that if you have opened

1238
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,880
the cylinder once

1239
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,359
what you could also do is open the

1240
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,720
cylinder

1241
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,800
and look at what's inside so you don't

1242
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,640
have to make all the setup keys but you

1243
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,119
just open it up look at the pins and the

1244
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,000
depth

1245
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
and you can maybe reassemble it or throw

1246
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,960
it away

1247
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,839
but this is also quite

1248
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,760
hard if you have a cylinder like this

1249
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
well at least i'm not able to to

1250
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,520
disassemble this but i'm able to

1251
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,839
disassemble it but i'm not able to then

1252
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,200
reassemble it

1253
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
if it would be a half cylinder that is

1254
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,720
doable

1255
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,839
still quite quite hard

1256
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,640
so that's actually where i am with the

1257
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,400
uh investigation it took me quite a lot

1258
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,720
of time i i did have a bit of a risk

1259
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
list wish list but i didn't have time

1260
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,839
enough to implement this before

1261
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,400
mch

1262
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,119
so i wanted to build a

1263
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,680
arduino shield where you have 16 hole

1264
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,839
sensors so you can put on a key and get

1265
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,440
a reading immediately for the complete

1266
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,640
key

1267
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,960
but obviously it doesn't really add to

1268
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,720
what i've been saying but

1269
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,560
it's just a nice project to to do

1270
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,359
another pcb and some electronic stuff

1271
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,119
and what also would be really nice is to

1272
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,520
make a device that would read out all

1273
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,480
the

1274
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,720
magnets from a cylinder in one go and i

1275
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,960
did later find out that there are uh

1276
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,599
devices that magnetomaters that are

1277
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,960
suitable for that

1278
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,000
um

1279
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,079
but yeah this is harder to solder and

1280
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,440
i didn't really pursue this yet

1281
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,800
so the conclusion

1282
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,960
with the advent of 3d printers copying

1283
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
keys has become much more easy

1284
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
for regular

1285
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,160
standard keys

1286
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,920
it's become super easy

1287
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,960
and

1288
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,480
yeah if you show your key to somebody

1289
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,000
and it's a regular key somebody can just

1290
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,640
make a picture of it and make a copy and

1291
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,319
3d print it

1292
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,400
with these it's still a bit more

1293
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,000
complicated with these keys because if

1294
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,359
you have a picture you could see the

1295
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,359
bidding but you can't see the magnets

1296
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
but of course if you have the bidding

1297
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,319
you can go to the cylinder it should the

1298
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,079
the key fits in and read out the magnets

1299
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
and then you have everything as well so

1300
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,440
you should still always

1301
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,440
keep your keys in your pocket or at

1302
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,319
least non-visible to others

1303
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,240
but the attacks are also in this law

1304
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,000
quite difficult because there is such a

1305
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,040
constrained space

1306
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,200
find the grand master key i thought it

1307
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,960
was it would be quite easy but in the

1308
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
end it is quite complicated

1309
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
much more than with conventional locks

1310
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,359
and please do not test stuff on

1311
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,440
cylinders that you that are not yours or

1312
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,119
that you do not use

1313
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,119
and in the end i would really spend like

1314
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,280
to spend a minute on

1315
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,720
hiro who has helped me out quite a lot a

1316
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
colleague of mine but also ankerslaught

1317
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,960
so in the process of responsible

1318
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,800
disclosure i talked to ancelott a while

1319
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,240
ago saying that i was going to do a

1320
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,400
presentation and i wanted to hear their

1321
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
thoughts about it and they were really

1322
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,559
super about it so the lead developer

1323
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,480
invited me to the factory in amsterday

1324
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
he showed me around he talked about this

1325
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,119
he knew about these things

1326
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,800
and he was really a great sports about

1327
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,040
it so i would like to if he's watching i

1328
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,000
would like to thank him very much

1329
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and in the end i would like to thank you

1330
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,079
for spending your time to being here

1331
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,960
with me tonight thank you very much

1332
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:53,440
[Applause]

1333
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,280
thank you we've probably got time for

1334
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,920
maybe one or two questions um if

1335
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,640
anyone's got any

1336
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,960
oh i've got one quickly

1337
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,400
could you

1338
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,640
could you've used electromagnets um

1339
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,720
instead of putting magnets in

1340
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,520
i i i have contemplated electromagnets

1341
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,280
but it was too much of a hassle to fight

1342
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,599
to make or find electromagnets and do it

1343
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,640
and

1344
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,240
yeah it would be very interesting

1345
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,599
because you could make a sort of setup

1346
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,680
key and maybe flip through all the

1347
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,040
possibilities and do a brute force

1348
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,720
attack or just

1349
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,960
click and you have the key

1350
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
but it would be just too hard for this

1351
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,040
project to actually make i'm already

1352
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,640
very happy with the result i have so far

1353
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,200
i spent a lot of times in on it and i

1354
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,720
learned a bunch of stuff about a lot of

1355
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,160
things and

1356
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,319
that's where it ends for me now okay no

1357
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,680
super thanks

1358
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,800
does anyone else have any other

1359
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,160
questions oh we've got one here

1360
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,200
since you've talked to a anchor as an

1361
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,920
ethical hacker is there a recommendation

1362
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,559
you have for for them to improve their

1363
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,000
locks so it's

1364
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,800
even harder to pick

1365
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,720
well they're already i would say big

1366
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,599
proof i mean for uh for

1367
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,839
for a company that buys a lock that that

1368
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,520
that wants to deter uh burglars

1369
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,800
this is secure enough this is fine

1370
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,079
and they're still selling these

1371
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,680
cylinders and they sell quite well i

1372
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,040
believe but of course they're also

1373
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,400
working on new ideas so i talked to the

1374
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,559
developer they also put magnets in their

1375
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,079
standard line they have an infinity line

1376
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,400
that also has a magnet and they're also

1377
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,920
making some they are actually making

1378
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,760
some improvements to this specific

1379
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,599
cylinder so yeah there's still a bit of

1380
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,000
development going on there

1381
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,079
but otherwise yeah i think this

1382
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,079
you should also not change too much on

1383
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,240
the design to prevent introducing other

1384
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,200
flaws

1385
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,960
so maybe they they will come up with a

1386
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,839
completely new design

1387
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,200
okay

1388
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,079
great

1389
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,400
well thank you very much indeed for

1390
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,760
explaining that to us it's fascinating

1391
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,000
you
