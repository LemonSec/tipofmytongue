1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,559
[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
this is a world premiere

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
of my new talk so uh

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,360
oh yeah exactly exactly

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,550
[Applause]

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,560
the truth is that i just got it good

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,560
just got it ready this afternoon in

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,359
total panic so everything is as as it

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,479
should be

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,520
um

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
i'll be talking about how to take log

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
for gay on a global scale using

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
collaborative security

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,680
um

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,879
yeah well

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,480
there aren't much to say other than that

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
there's a fancy picture of me from when

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,559
i worked at kpmd and had to wear a tie

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,920
to go to work

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
and also i had to go to work which i

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,480
don't

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
now anymore because everything is work

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,120
from home

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
um

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
yeah i don't want to i don't want to

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
repeat all that

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
um

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
in order to understand how data is

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
collected we need to talk a little bit

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,400
about

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
how crosstalk works it's not going to be

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
a completely product marketing talk

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,799
but just a very overall basic talk about

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
about that

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
um but first i want to address

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
one of the reasons why crosstalk was

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
built in the first place because as we

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,320
all know

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,159
all those of us who work with cyber

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,520
security who has an interest in cyber

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
security there is a problem that is not

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
solved because everybody gets hacked and

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
the as time goes those of us who has

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
been around for a long time know that

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
more and more people get gets hacked

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
and companies spend bigger and bigger

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
fortunes trying to prevent that and and

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
it doesn't work

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
right so so

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
so basically what you could ask yourself

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
is is are we doing something wrong

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
and

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,439
obviously uh cardsec

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,200
has another approach to this which we

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
think is makes much more sense

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
and basically

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,280
it's time for a new approach to approach

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
because we tried

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
outpowering the bad guys didn't work we

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,758
tried outsmarting them didn't work

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,640
why don't we try to outnumber them

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
because when you think of it

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
there is more bad guy there is more of

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
us than of the bad guys so why don't we

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
try and

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,879
take advantage of that because if when

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,400
you think of it nobody wants to fight a

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,840
beehive if

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
a single bee not so bad but if a

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
thousand bees come

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
comes running at you you run if you're

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
saying you run and that's because there

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
are a lot of them so so we let's try to

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
take the that analogy and put it into

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,359
into security

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
so basically uh

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
i'll try to

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
in in trying to explain how crosstalk

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
works are usually compared with with

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
waste and calling it the waste of cyber

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,560
security and if you don't know what waze

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
is waste is a gps app on your phone

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
that shares

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
information about your travel how fast

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
you're going where your where there is

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
where the queues and

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
where where the holes in the roads and

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
stuff like that

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
and it shares that with all the other

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
um

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,920
waste users so that everybody hopefully

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
avoids all that stuff

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
and the sword is the same with with

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
crowd's sake card's sake that takes the

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
attack it sees on your servers and

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
shares them with everyone with everybody

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
else it also blocks the attacks

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
if you want that which you which you

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
typically want

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
and basically

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
crowdsick wreaths lock

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,560
right

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
then it detects threats it mitigates

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,319
those threats and it sends those signals

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,840
back

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,959
and then they are assessed and shared

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,760
with

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,599
the community with the rest of community

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,518
as block lists basically

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,439
yeah

111
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
these are just example of attacks i'm

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
not going to talk very much about them

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
other than the cards they can also

114
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,920
detect uh web-based attacks and this is

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
what like what we did when in terms of

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
this lock 4k thing because

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
crosstag reads the web server lock and

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
detects

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
basically

120
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
those log4j strings

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
that

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
some of you may remember

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
that was part of the attack

124
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
and the the and in general this is how

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
crosstalk works whatever web-based

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,000
attack crowdstick

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
is trying to mitigate it's just doing it

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,039
just looking at the log

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
the current stat as of yesterday is that

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
we collect around 1.3 million signal

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
each day

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
we have 3.7 million ips in our smoke

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
database which i'll be talking about in

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
a little while um

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,360
and around 33

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
33 000 ips in our

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
curated blog list that are distributed

138
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,320
to to other users

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,759
i'll be talking

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,120
a little bit more about how big the

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
network is and

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,199
what we call network strength in a later

143
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
slide

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
and the chrysler is open source

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
and

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
the the license we've chosen for krauss

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
for crosstag is smit which means that

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
it's free forever

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
once

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
the horse has been opened it cannot be

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
closed and that is completely by design

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,759
because

153
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,479
being a young company and all that um

154
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,320
there is a risk that somebody with a lot

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
of money

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,320
wants to buy us so we can we can have we

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
can have a lot of money which is good

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,960
but what is not good is is is if those

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
if that company based off money as or

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
driven by money as companies often are

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
they want to close the source and and

162
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
basically screw up the community school

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
with the community and and destroy

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
everything we've worked for

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
so hence this is mit

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
it's open if if something if if a

167
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
company wants to do that nothing happens

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
the the code get the code gets forked

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
and

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
that was a bad decision

171
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
um

172
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,319
we offer

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
crosstalk office a fair deal we think

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
you share

175
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
the the

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
information about your tax you see and

177
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,080
you get

178
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
all the bloodless stuff back for free

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,800
so that is so so that is sort of the the

180
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
the trading agreement if you don't want

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
to share then you can always you know

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
pay and stuff but but crosstalk is free

183
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
to use no strings attached

184
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
and a question that i'm using that i'm

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
often asked is what about privacy well

186
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
it's pretty easy to

187
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
to not

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
to not give out people's information if

189
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,160
you don't collect them because usually

190
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
when um

191
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
when something is free it means you're

192
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
the product that's how it is with

193
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
facebook and everything else but in

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
crowdtake you're not the product the the

195
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
bad guys ip ips they're the products so

196
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,759
basically

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,479
that's it's their privacy that we that

198
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,960
we sell and honestly who cares i mean

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
they ask for it so um

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,039
carson only collects the timestamp of

201
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,319
of any given event um the offending ip

202
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,360
and

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
a behavior which basically means a

204
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
a scenario that's been triggered a

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,680
scenario can be ssh brute forcing

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,560
or

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
any attack it's just that that is

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
everything we collect we don't collect

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
anything about how the attack is being

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
performed whatever we just know that

211
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,080
this method this scenario and that's it

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
another

213
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,440
option or another important thing with

214
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,759
with cardstack is how do you deal with

215
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
poisoning and false positives

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
there is a there is no there's an

217
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
inbuilt consensus engine that works on

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
the server side of karsaq which

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
assesses all all ips that are put that

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
are put that have been sent to us in the

221
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
in the smoke database this is this is

222
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
the the initial database where signals

223
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
enter

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,319
there's a trust rank um

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,639
basically all new agents all ages has a

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
trust rank attached and they start with

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
trust ranks here and and over time as

228
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
they are contributing signal signals and

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,199
they prove trustworthy and all that

230
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,400
um

231
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
gate and rises uh and after six months

232
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,759
of being

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,000
rock stable and trustworthy they got a

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,960
thrust rank of 99 and

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
that is important because this trust

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
rank is being used as a sort of a

237
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
point score

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
whenever an ip is deemed malevolent for

239
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
instance it needs an ip in order for it

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
to be malevolent it needs a certain

241
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
amount of points and those points are

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
based on the on the thrust rank

243
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
basically

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
and and and the reason for this is that

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
is that we want to we want it to be as

246
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
expensive and

247
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
and

248
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
hard to poison the database because if

249
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
you are a um

250
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
a bad guys and what the person the

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
database it takes a lot of time that's

252
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
one thing and also

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
in this voting process

254
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
and asn can only give one vote meaning

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
that if you want to have if you think

256
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
you can poison

257
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
the crosstalk database by by buying a

258
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
thousand vpss on the same cloud provider

259
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
you're wrong because they don't have

260
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
many exams so you need to have them on a

261
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,399
lot of asms around the world in order

262
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
for to have a chance to build

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,480
this trust rank and also a lot of time

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
there is in terms of

265
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
false positive

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,279
we have a small fleet of honey parts

267
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
where we basically

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
evaluate

269
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
the the signals that comes from from all

270
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,800
the agents that we don't have control

271
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
over so the honeypots have a slightly

272
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
bigger source rank

273
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,560
there's a white list there are certain

274
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
ips that we don't want to want to

275
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,600
blacklist like

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,120
google dns

277
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
cloud fair cdns

278
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
stuff like that

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
and

280
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
this looks a little bit pretty crimeish

281
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
but there's also a predictive algorithm

282
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
saying that if a certain

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
number of ips from the same net block

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
has been doing bad things we just at

285
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
some point we just blocked the entire

286
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,320
net block

287
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
saying that nothing good comes out of

288
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
that why not block them in advance

289
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
and then after this consensus process

290
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
ips are being sent to the fire database

291
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
and distributed back

292
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
and as i said before

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
there's around 3.7 million ips in the

294
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
smoke database and around 33 000 in the

295
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
fire database so

296
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
it is very conservative

297
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,760
assessment because we don't want false

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
processes we just simply don't

299
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
and so far it works well

300
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
um

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
this is not a detailed talk about

302
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
cardstack even though that you may have

303
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
failed it like that already um if you

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
want to want to learn

305
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
more about which os is supported and how

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
crosstalk works and details and all that

307
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
i have i'm having some workshop during

308
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
mch

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
i'll talk a little bit about those that

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
are already arranged

311
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
if you want to have one

312
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
in your village or whatever just

313
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,800
feel feel free to approach me and i'm

314
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
sure we can

315
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
find a way to do that

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
um

317
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
yeah there are more details on that in

318
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
the end of my talk and now it's time for

319
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,160
my first break

320
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,240
right

321
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
before i'm talking specifically about

322
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
log4j it's important to understand that

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
crowdfund is not a it's not a very very

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
case of firewall it's not a bath

325
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
and regarding love for gate is

326
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,839
particularly important

327
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,760
because as you may know

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
if not then i'll talk about a little bit

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
later it only takes one request

330
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
uh if you're vulnerable to uh to get to

331
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
get compromised

332
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
so

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,519
and be and give and because crosstalk

334
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
reach locks things needs to be in the

335
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
lock before it can be blocked and if

336
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
it's is and if so and if it's already in

337
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,040
the block and you're vulnerable then

338
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
you're already so

339
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
crowdsack relies very much on this

340
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
network effect it relies very much on

341
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,959
the community signals if you're a

342
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,639
vulnerable server and you're protecting

343
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
the scar stick then

344
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
you hope that the network has to take

345
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
those ips because yeah

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,480
you're in trouble

347
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
luckily hold this this whole reputation

348
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,040
basically i worked pretty well because

349
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
we did we did a small study not

350
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
scientific at all uh where we were on

351
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
two identical servers in try in and and

352
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,320
the whole objective was to try and find

353
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
out how big is the network effect

354
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
basically we set up two dpn servers on

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
aws

356
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
identical the only difference was that

357
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
one of them had

358
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
the bouncer

359
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
the bouncer part of crosstalk which is

360
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
the ips part of krausseg

361
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
blocking traffic

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
because

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
once once once you have blocked

364
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
the eyepiece in the thread in in the in

365
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
the firewall

366
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
in the firewall of the host machine

367
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
where crosstalk is installed then it

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
won't be in the log and then it won't be

369
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
in the stats basically

370
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
so we left those machines running for

371
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
three months and it turned out that 92

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
percent of

373
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,279
all the bad traffic aid aimed at the

374
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,760
server was blocked by the community

375
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
already so this is good news

376
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
if you're if you're vulnerable for luck

377
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,639
to love for gay back in december and uh

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
you relied on crosstalk for this

379
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
um but it's also important to note that

380
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,000
that that this is also crosstag is also

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
in a way resemble resembling to a honda

382
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
part in general because it's possible to

383
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
install the crowdsack

384
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
scenario or the honeypot scenario in the

385
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
scenario without being vulnerable you

386
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
just need a web server

387
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
so conclusion community matters

388
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,600
all right this hopefully this is the

389
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
part you came for this is what is where

390
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
we are now

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
um

392
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
if there should be

393
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
a couple of you who don't know what log

394
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
for day is i'll give you a the very

395
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
short version of this

396
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,000
um

397
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,519
on december 9th

398
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
last year apache foundation released an

399
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
info on a critical block in the love4j

400
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
library

401
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
exploitable via remote via remote code

402
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
execution

403
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
and then

404
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
it turns out lock4day is used everywhere

405
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
and by everywhere i mean everywhere

406
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,320
right

407
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
and i saw this tweet from a guy called

408
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,440
casper coden

409
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
which where it dawned on me because he

410
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
had in his iphone he had set his name to

411
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,760
this

412
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
specific jdi string

413
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,000
which com which it then exploits the

414
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
server and and it turned out he got a

415
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,399
connection back from apple servers and

416
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
they were and they were vulnerable

417
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,320
and then i was like

418
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
it really is everywhere so it was

419
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,720
everywhere so everybody obviously went

420
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
totally in panic

421
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
and

422
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
everybody had and their

423
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,959
everybody was busy uh at least in this

424
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
in the security field to

425
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
uh it was by by reason free tools and

426
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
resources to help out and so did we

427
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
we we released the entire list of

428
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
of ips that were actively

429
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,839
abusing

430
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
the vulnerability so that people could

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
import into their own firewall

432
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,639
this is a super fast uh overview of of

433
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,720
the timeline the

434
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
the

435
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
the the details of the under

436
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,040
vulnerability was released on on

437
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
december 9th on december 10th

438
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
crashlytic released the first version of

439
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
the log4j scenario

440
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
then

441
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
that scenario was pushed out to a number

442
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
of agents and and the signal started

443
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
pouring in a little bit

444
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,920
um

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
but it didn't peak until like two days

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
later because

447
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,959
when you think of it this is a really

448
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
good example of

449
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
what

450
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
what is cool about this whole community

451
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,639
stuff that that that when that we have

452
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,600
when you have a a community of

453
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
crosstalk users that that could that you

454
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
can utilize in this way just by sending

455
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
sending other scenarios to them then you

456
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,199
can

457
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
start harvesting

458
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
cgi on on even new vulnerabilities

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
and it and it happened pretty fast

460
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
um

461
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
as

462
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
the attacks evolved

463
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,079
we also needed to

464
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,839
update the scenarios

465
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
because in the beginning it was just

466
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
this plain texturing but i think of a

467
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,040
few obvious stations and shenanigans and

468
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,399
stuff

469
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,959
made them happen of course as

470
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,160
hackers do

471
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
so we had to update the scenarios as

472
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
well

473
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
so on december 12 on december 13th on

474
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
december 16th

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
and finally on december 20th when

476
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
somebody from the community was adding

477
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
some unicode

478
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,079
a bypass pattern thing um

479
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
it was updated then and then

480
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
in the end it turned out there was there

481
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
was 34 grog patterns

482
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,160
uh in in the end scenario which is uh

483
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
pretty cool i think

484
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
this is uh the spike of signals you can

485
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,119
see here on december 10th

486
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
not much going on on december 12th it

487
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,559
goes bananas

488
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
um

489
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,679
but as we started getting signals there

490
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
was there was some signals that we that

491
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
we that we received that was somewhat

492
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
different and our data scientists looked

493
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
into it and it turned out that it was

494
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
that there was a german

495
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,360
security research company that would do

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
who were doing scanning

497
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
and obviously we didn't want to

498
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
interfere with their

499
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
research or anything and also they were

500
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,640
not any harm so we blocked them out

501
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
and this is how log for day

502
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,360
is looking on up until now

503
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
you can see a big drop in the end of may

504
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
and then after that there were a little

505
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
there were a few things going on

506
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
especially there were two big parts two

507
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
big spikes to the right

508
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,039
which i'll be talking a little talking a

509
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,120
little bit about

510
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,239
that was on june 21st and july 7th

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
we're not really sure what happened but

512
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
we know who did it

513
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
it's this guy

514
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
13.89.48.118

515
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
both on

516
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
june 22nd and on july 7th

517
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,000
this guy was going crazy with the love4j

518
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
attacks

519
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
um

520
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,520
we don't

521
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
really know

522
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,039
um it was it was interesting because and

523
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,600
this this our data scientists he he

524
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
tweeted that on june 22nd

525
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,240
and then on july 7th

526
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,360
there was

527
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
double as many attacks and as as

528
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,159
as he saw on on june 21st

529
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
as i said we don't know why

530
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
but we have a theory at least for june

531
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
21st and that theory is that on june

532
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
23rd

533
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
um

534
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,919
there was a there was a report from from

535
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,200
cesar the cyber security and

536
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
infrastructure security agency in the us

537
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,039
who warned that

538
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
malicious cyber cyber actors were trying

539
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
to exploit lock for shell in vmware

540
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
horizon servers so

541
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,360
one can only guess

542
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,919
that that's what they were trying to do

543
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,799
and

544
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,640
given as i said when i talked about

545
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
log4j in italy in initially um

546
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,880
log4j library is everywhere so it's

547
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,720
highly unlikely that everything is

548
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
patched by now and probably ever will so

549
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,360
we

550
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
we may see more of this who knows

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
and

552
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
it's pretty clear that then when you

553
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,520
that when you're collecting a lot of

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
data like like we do

555
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,039
there are other

556
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,720
fun things to see

557
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
some more fun than others i give you

558
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
that but

559
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
here it goes

560
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
here is the top ten of asns hosting

561
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,039
malevolent traffic

562
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,240
some are

563
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
more legit than others

564
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
i'll talk a little bit about

565
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
hackers and their need for anonymity in

566
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
a little while and why and when why they

567
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,760
are hacking like that

568
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,799
and then also about how um

569
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,120
how some cloud providers are better than

570
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
others in taking those

571
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,400
those bad

572
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,679
those compromise servers down

573
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,240
let's look at the two figures of bold

574
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,360
because

575
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
the top one shows that over time all the

576
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
ips that um

577
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
that has been seen at least once at

578
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
least once and the malevolent at some

579
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,360
point

580
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,679
over time since crosstalk started like a

581
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,640
year and a half ago is around 2.79

582
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
but if you look at it how many new ips

583
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
does ip does crowdsake verify in a in a

584
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
week then it's six times as high meaning

585
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
that

586
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,000
the the the

587
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the eyepiece that the bad guys are using

588
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,840
is rotating a lot on the short on the

589
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,360
short term

590
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
and the reason why they do that is

591
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,799
because they want to be anonymous

592
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
and and then

593
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,440
and the way one of the one of the the

594
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,120
ideas behind crowdstrike is to

595
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,039
automatically detect all those attack

596
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
and block them right away and by the

597
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
root by the root if possible

598
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
so this is a good news because we really

599
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
want to put those

600
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,959
essos out of business

601
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
two percent of those ips they renew

602
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,039
every 12 hours and in a week 12 percent

603
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
of the ips are seen

604
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
for the first time

605
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,640
so yes it's it turns out at least when

606
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
you look at the look at the stats

607
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,480
directly it looks like

608
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,280
the crowd6 strategy by blogging those

609
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
ips right away automatically

610
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,120
is a good idea if we get the world

611
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
domination that we are

612
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,679
trying to achieve

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
this is another thing because it turns

614
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,840
out that zip is constantly being

615
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
hammered

616
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
um we talked to a

617
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
a user back in november that

618
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,280
is a friend's voice of ip provider and

619
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,159
they

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,600
were seeing a lot of

621
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,559
things

622
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,360
a lot of the zip brute forcing and they

623
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,520
suggested that we wrote a scenario for

624
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,840
it and we have done that for for our

625
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
honey parts only and i'll tell you in a

626
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
little while while that why that is

627
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
important

628
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,840
but

629
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
if you look at it

630
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,559
per agent then then the sip scenarios

631
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
are by far the biggest contributor

632
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,159
um because on one day

633
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
we we go we got 83 000

634
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
signals just just unzip just on that

635
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
single scenario

636
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,559
and um

637
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,000
given that it's only installed on

638
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,080
honeypots and honeypots are special in

639
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
the sense that they don't block first of

640
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
all they don't block

641
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
attacks so um so when the tiger can in

642
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
theory keep on keep on hammering

643
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
and also when

644
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
the way the scenario is made is pretty

645
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,240
dumb so it reacts on any on any request

646
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
to the zip protocol but given this that

647
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,039
is a honey pot nobody would want to

648
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
talk to it anyway that's what honeypot

649
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
is for right

650
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,799
and also it turns out that this age is

651
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,600
constantly being hammered

652
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
um

653
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,480
this is by far the most important

654
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
scenarios we got we get around i said

655
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,200
1.3 million uh ips or 1.3 million

656
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
signals every day and around a million

657
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,559
of those are running on are on ssh

658
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
either normal brute forcing or slow

659
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
brute forcing

660
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,440
and we get signals from 5000 agents and

661
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
around and uh

662
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,880
and 6 000 so 60 000 bad actors are

663
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,080
reported on this

664
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,400
this is over time an overview of

665
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,799
of the top threads that that we've

666
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,640
detected

667
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,039
over time we have to take the 102

668
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,080
million signals

669
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,799
and

670
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
60 percent the orange and the blue and

671
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
the green those were the ones we saw

672
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
before this those are ssh brute forcing

673
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,279
um

674
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,080
windows is only windows brute forcing is

675
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
only around two percent of those

676
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
but crowdsec is data is

677
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,480
is most likely or they are totally

678
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
uh

679
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,799
totally guaranteed to be biased because

680
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
crosstag is mostly on linux and even

681
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
when you install crosstalk on linux it

682
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
automatically detects ios that you have

683
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,600
ssh and install the scenario for that

684
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
and

685
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
windows is a very it's very new it's a

686
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
very new platform so it's not very

687
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,159
widely used yet

688
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,159
oh sorry i spam

689
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,200
this is an overview of um

690
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
of selected cloud cloud vendors and how

691
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,320
good they are at cleaning up when when

692
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
when the vps or customers vps has been

693
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
compromised

694
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
on the xi the x-axis there is what we

695
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
call the malevolent duration

696
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
and that is the number of days and ips

697
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
reported by the community

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
so an average ip of all

699
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
an average md my level duration duration

700
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
of all ips in in this in in their in

701
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,000
their asn is an indicator of

702
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
the due diligence

703
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,440
um in terms of dealing with compromised

704
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,799
assets

705
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
um

706
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
and on the end on the y-axis there's a

707
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
number of asn's this cloud this cloud

708
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,400
provider has

709
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,039
there's a big difference between

710
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
the cloud providers and how good they

711
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
are at taking down come by servers but

712
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
there's also a huge difference between

713
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,000
between

714
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,919
hosts in terms of how many risky

715
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,000
services they host and for instance like

716
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
a vulnerable php cms that's like asking

717
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
for trouble right

718
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,039
um

719
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,760
yes in the orange here is the average

720
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,080
md

721
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
for each provider and aws was best of

722
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,000
those that that we looked at three days

723
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
in general it took them aboard virus owh

724
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
ovh took 17 days

725
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,120
so it's not a it's not to say that aws

726
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,679
are good and ovas are bad these are

727
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,120
indications that we see

728
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,159
and

729
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,039
in spite of how good aws are at cleaning

730
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,640
up they're still

731
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
they still have a lot of attacks so we

732
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
wonder how it would have looked if if

733
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,440
they were if they were worse at cleaning

734
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
up

735
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,120
so aws dominates the space with the

736
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
detail ocean i don't know if that's

737
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,799
something to be proud of or not

738
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,200
and then

739
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
the crowdstrike the crowds like network

740
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,320
strength is basically the top 10 of the

741
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
of the most

742
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,159
of the of the countries that has most

743
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,320
classic agents

744
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
the picture is a little bit blurry

745
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,080
because france us germany netherlands

746
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,440
they have a lot of cloud providers so we

747
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,400
may know

748
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
where the ips are physically but

749
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,640
we don't know

750
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,799
where where users are from of course

751
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,360
and

752
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,799
that was it

753
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
yeah if um

754
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
you want to try out crosstak i am i'm

755
