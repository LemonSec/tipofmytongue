[Music]

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
i absolutely love drawbots i bet many of

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,359
you do as well

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,880
this session will go over richard's

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,519
journey to hack the quincy drawing bot

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
uh he wanted to hack this robot to draw

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
pokemons for his son

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
and uh that's sort of the root of this

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
and he has promised that at the end of

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
this session you can win

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
uh one of these quincy robots so we'll

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
have uh we'll have a section we might

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
have a truncated q a to make sure we can

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,559
have that session uh to um so you can

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,039
win win one of these so thank you very

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
much for coming and uh enjoy richard

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
cool thank you very much

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
raffling off too um and you need your

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
phone for that so i hope everyone has a

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
phone um so you should be good for that

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,799
but yeah good afternoon thanks for for

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
visiting this talk uh my name is richard

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,080
aka d any key that's my my nickname and

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,159
i i guess i am one of those like many of

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
here um self-proclaimed uh amateur

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
hackers coders makers uh i i do many

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,280
things actually make lots of projects um

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,479
on the background actually if you can

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,759
see what it is it's one of the projects

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
i made many years ago it was a

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
3d scanner based on a lot of raspberry

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
pi's a hundred raspberry pi's uh joined

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,759
up in one network

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
because i wanted to have a 3d scan of my

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
son so my son often is the the driving

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
factor in my life uh having children i

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,360
think is really very uh

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
insightful in the things you want to do

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
in life um and i wanted to have a scan

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
of him and unfortunately my son

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
literally cannot stand still

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
not even one second so all the regular

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
scatting methods like a connect scanner

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
and those kinds of things weren't

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
possible so when the raspberry pi camera

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
came out literally at that time i

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,479
thought well let's just buy some of them

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
i started with 20 and

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,878
got too many more and i can now make 3d

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,160
scans of my

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
son um this project and many of my other

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
projects are actually

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
officially uh released they're available

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
for you to see and watch

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
i have a page on instructables.com

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,319
where you find most of my hardware

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
projects uh that i make

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
and anything that i typically do with

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,959
code um i also tend to directly put it

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
on github and and share and i'll come

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
back to that actually why i'm doing that

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
because i actually don't do that just so

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
i give other people benefit but actually

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
i get a lot of benefit out of it myself

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
and that's why i'll come to that and i

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,519
think really it's really important when

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
you share things to do so but this

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
particular project um

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
came about that i came about this lovely

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
little quincy drawing robot um

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
at that time

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
this thing was dead cheap

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
it was i bought it for 29 euros

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,879
um and i don't know how you can make a

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
three axis or some two and a half

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
semi-axis uh robot with an arm processor

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
in it stepper motors in it a camera in

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,519
it

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,200
a battery in it

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
for 29 euros but i guess you can um so

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
actually bought a few um

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
to start thinking around with it and

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
those kinds of things now i did put an

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
asterisk with it because of course

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
nowadays do the shortage of electronics

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
the prices have gone up so if you start

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
googling around on

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
an amazon or you can still buy them uh

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
they're still on aliexpress that's where

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
i uh

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
bought a few of them as well

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
but the price on 4k has gone up a little

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
bit and what can this drawing robot do

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
is it can actually um not just draw it

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
can actually teach people children or

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
whatever

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,440
how to draw so it comes with all these

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,519
cards or things you want to learn a dog

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,159
a cat a fox a squirrel or whatever

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
and it will take step by step

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
show you how to draw then you take each

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,040
step and you try to

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
copy and mimic that

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
and it works in a simple concept you

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,519
show it a card there's a camera inside

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
the the robot

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,280
i fear if it was a maybe

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,879
nfc or something but no it's a simple

110
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
camera and actually on the back of the

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
card

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
is a qr code that it scans and therefore

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,440
it knows what instructions should follow

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
so i did this of course with my kit

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,560
we presented with a card

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
and i see the robot draws it actually in

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
front of so facing the right direction

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
for the kid so every step it does and in

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,880
this case we showed it a uh i should

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
make you guess actually what it is but

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
anyone else sees what this is

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
it's a squirrel um or

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
when my son drew it i'm not sure if it's

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
really a squirrel or something like that

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
but um so we we

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
we did the squirrel thing and we did the

127
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,199
dog and the fox fig i think

128
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
but then of course my son came daddy

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
great but i'm not really a squirrel fan

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
i am a pikachu fan um can you make it

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,199
please

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
draw pikachu uh like

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,440
okay we can at least investigate this

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
this opportunity this possibility so i

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
did open up the box

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,440
found out what's inside of it this is

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,120
the motherboard of the of the robot it

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
actually has an arm processor a very

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
well documented arm processor by the way

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,759
you'll find this processor on many

141
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
small embedded

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440
chips and devices that are out there so

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
the documentation is rightly available

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
and actually one thing that you also see

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,800
actually very nicely is there's some pin

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,080
headers here are

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
on the left side and i'm pretty sure i

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
didn't do the trace yet because actually

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
didn't go down that route but i'm pretty

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,039
sure that's the interface to directly

151
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,639
override the firmware and write your own

152
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,759
firmware and that kind of stuff so

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
actually i'm quite surprised how easily

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
accessible

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
they they made this thing but i wanted i

156
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
didn't want to go down the hardware

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
route i wanted to just see if i can

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,080
actually

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
leverage the existing software that was

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,680
inside of it to see if we could make it

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
do things other things and i said how

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
does the thing work

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
it takes a qr code

164
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,039
um and it does something so

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,880
i just started to reverse engineer from

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
how how does that work so if you take

167
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
the qr code and you scan that you see

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
that there's some code pops up in this

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,880
case this is a card of a dog and it

170
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
always starts with excavation mark a i

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
assume the a stands for action or

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
something like that no clue then a dog

173
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
zero zero zero now in the back of the

174
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
unit is actually an sd card slot reader

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
um so there's a micro sd card in there

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
and actually if you put that sd card in

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
your computer it's a just normal in

178
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
english complex

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
file system

180
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
because a lot of things in china not

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
always makes it a lot harder

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
troubleshooting but it was actually

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
everything was super nice in english and

184
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,360
as you can see there's a direct

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
relationship between what you scan

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
and it goes to a certain directory now

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,160
if you then go

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
inside the directory uh you'll find some

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
files and some of the things very

190
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
clearly made sense already uh dot smd

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
well i guess that's the sound file the

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
the things it talks

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
and if you did analyze it that's just a

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
raw uh web file so that's actually

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
easy to use and create and lots of tools

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
available for that

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
and then there's this magic secretive

198
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
pmd file and an ias file and the pmd

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
files are many of them and there's

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,199
always per directory there is this one

201
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
iis file and this one i was able to open

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,919
up and again looked very

203
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
simple realistic

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,440
didn't need actual documentation i think

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
i could figure this out because i knew

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,800
when i showed a car to that thing what

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
it does it starts talking it starts

208
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,319
giving instructions and then start doing

209
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
certain drawing things that i have to

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
redraw and at the end actually like if

211
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,560
this is a

212
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
this is a dock at the end actually you

213
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
have to um

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
write down doc and you have to put the

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
show the cards dog to the machine and

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
that's actually the last three steps

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
which is here so that's the difference

218
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
between a p and a c with c

219
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
i guess capture or something like that

220
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
you actually have to show it the d so it

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,720
knows that you show the d and say oh

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
great you did the the d thing

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
so what this was easy to think i can i

224
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,759
can write this not too complicated

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,000
but yeah how do i draw that's clearly in

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
that pmd file thing now of course we can

227
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
look inside that pmd file

228
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,720
unfortunately that's where the journey

229
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
of easiness stopped

230
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
yeah this was just abracadabra whatever

231
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
stuff it definitely wasn't it wasn't

232
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
json or human readable or or whatever

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
stuff um

234
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
now first thing i do

235
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,120
uh many people should learn that if you

236
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
don't know something you just google it

237
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
instead of asking someone else um so i

238
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
of course go to google and say hey

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,680
what's a

240
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,399
pmd file format and

241
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,799
i actually think it's a

242
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
so google will tell you that it is some

243
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
page maker whatever out of 1980s or

244
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,839
something like that but unfortunately

245
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,080
google is this case wrong

246
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
because while

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
that did exist and had the same name

248
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,399
it's not the same file

249
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,600
format

250
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
so here i really had to start figuring

251
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,680
out so how do you take a file of data

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,920
and and try to figure out what it what

253
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,080
it entails and that kind of stuff and

254
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
now one thing i was sure of it contains

255
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,600
data on how to draw something

256
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
um issue numbers

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
something with numbers uh or something

258
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,080
like that so what i did is i wrote a

259
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
very simple program and that we just

260
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,279
take

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,720
every single

262
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
byte or a few bytes combinational bytes

263
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
to form a number

264
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
and and and show me what the picture

265
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
comes out of that um

266
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
simple so my version attempt resulted to

267
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
this

268
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
um

269
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
yeah they didn't give me the dog that i

270
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
was looking for or something like that

271
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
so

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
um and even though i've been programming

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
for quite a while

274
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
and normally when you program and you

275
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480
work with integers or floats other

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
different types of number systems

277
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
you never hardcore actually know on how

278
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
it actually is being stored in a foul

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,160
at least i never did

280
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
so i had to do some research on that and

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
i found out that actually many ways and

282
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,040
how you can write a number into a file

283
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
so of course you have two byte numbers

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,959
you have four bias so how many bytes you

285
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
use to create the number

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
uh you have something called little

287
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
indians and big indians depending on if

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,640
it writes from the right to the left or

289
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
the left to the right of numbers

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
um so well instead of me trying to guess

291
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
all this out

292
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,399
i just started randomly guessing and

293
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
throwing that to my program and see um

294
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
what came out of that and at some point

295
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
um

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,000
this came out and

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
still doesn't look like a dog

298
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,399
but

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,760
i guess there was something with these

300
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,120
numbers

301
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
it can't be artificial damage or

302
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
something i was i think on on a

303
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
relatively good way so i did a lot of

304
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
more troubleshooting and actually

305
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,079
i use a hex editor to figure it out

306
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,519
because the main thing that i was

307
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
struggling with is that

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
so the numbers are four bytes

309
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
but my file size divided by four

310
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
was not a whole number

311
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,360
like

312
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
how's that possible

313
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
and then i figured out well each file

314
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
starts always with the same byte so

315
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,600
there is actually

316
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
the first byte of each file is just an

317
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
identification that hey i am this pmd

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
file whatever thing

319
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
did more and more troubleshooting and

320
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,640
then i found out actually the second

321
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
byte

322
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
tells me how many segments are in the

323
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,920
file of the steps of what it has to draw

324
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
and then per file it had another byte

325
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
that says how many coordinates or

326
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
numbers at least there were in so that i

327
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
figured out

328
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,399
wasn't sure yet how to draw it and all

329
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
that kind of stuff but what i did do is

330
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
already directly document this on github

331
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
now i'm pretty sure this thing is not

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
very popular in the world i don't know

333
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
how many people have one of these things

334
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,079
so

335
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
i didn't thought that this would reach a

336
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
million people audience or anything like

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
that but for me it's easy just to

338
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,720
document also for myself always a great

339
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
place to find my information back if i

340
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
stop a project and later on move on and

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
so i wrote down what i found said wrote

342
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,680
down how i think the the file format

343
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
is on

344
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
and i went on with my journey i tried to

345
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
start figuring out

346
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
how can i take these numbers and how

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
does that machine turn that into an

348
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
actual drawing action and i was getting

349
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
closer and closer but i was really

350
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
struggling because

351
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
and what you see here is so in the set

352
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
of cards there is a

353
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
card for a circle and a card for a

354
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,360
square so i took some of these code

355
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
snippets and i just put them into one

356
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
file so it would draw um two squares and

357
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
a circle for me to like calibrate so i

358
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
can also figure out what the numbers

359
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
will be like at least what i should be

360
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
expecting and that kind of stuff but

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
every time my software was drawing the

362
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
data from that

363
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
i got something that looked like it

364
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,839
but but wasn't the same

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
this really baffled me this was really

366
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
things but that's the nice thing about

367
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
sharing without me asking suddenly i get

368
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
this email from some random guy in

369
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,320
canada saying hey i saw your github page

370
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
um i was thinking about one of these

371
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
robots

372
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
i like to see if i can help and that

373
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,680
kind of stuff and he was already writing

374
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,440
code as well he didn't even had the

375
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
robot yet and he was already writing

376
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
code for it which was amazing he did

377
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
order it but it took a long time for him

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
to get from aliexpress and he was also

379
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,519
getting the same strange way for he was

380
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
doing random coordinate things and

381
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
instead of getting a square he was

382
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,839
getting this kind of

383
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
you know i don't know fish shape uh

384
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
thing or something like that

385
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
and then i started thinking or we

386
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
started actually thinking it's like

387
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
i've always been thinking about

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
coordinates xy

389
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
that must be in the foul but if you see

390
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,279
how the robot works the robot has two

391
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,240
arms

392
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,839
and the literally is like you like me as

393
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
a human being the arms are not on the

394
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,120
same beginning point there's one on the

395
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
left and one on the right

396
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
and um what this entails in

397
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
is this concept here so you have the

398
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,839
arms the shoulder joints at the top

399
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
there's two and a half centimeters in

400
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
between

401
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
and there's an 11 centimeters for the

402
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,279
upper arm 10 centimeters for the

403
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,800
underarm and that's where it comes

404
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
together

405
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,839
so i was thinking maybe these numbers

406
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,360
were not xy but there were angles of

407
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
of these two shoulders

408
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,639
now that sounded very plausible

409
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
but then the real challenge started so i

410
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
don't know who's here good at math

411
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
but that's mathematically

412
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
quite difficult at least

413
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
my math skills definitely stop there how

414
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
do i calculate if i knew what those two

415
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,040
angles were

416
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
having two and a half centimeters apart

417
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,000
from each other they're joined together

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,639
if i move this angle here where what is

419
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,199
in the end the x y coordinate

420
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,839
of that endpoint over there

421
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,600
now i teach go to dojo programming

422
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
lessons every saturday and one of my

423
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
fellow coder dojo

424
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,680
colleagues um is actually a math rock

425
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,760
star so he drew this up for me on a

426
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
piece of paper

427
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
and i'm like

428
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
dude well thank you very much for your

429
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
effort but uh

430
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,760
how do i translate that into code

431
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,399
and he was also so he somewhat thinks he

432
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,600
figured it out

433
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
but he was really also struggling but

434
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
the original point is not zero comma

435
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,680
zero there's one on the left and one is

436
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
on the right and how do you put that in

437
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,720
math and then how to work that out and

438
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
that kind of stuff

439
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,120
so

440
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,279
i was working on this like trying trying

441
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
to learn myself math now that's not an

442
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
easy thing on my age so i really started

443
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,279
to give up i like this this is not gonna

444
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,120
work i need i need some serious help

445
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
here

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
um and then i actually did something

447
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
that i do for lots of other more

448
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
typically graphical things let's see if

449
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,760
i can actually hire cheap help to to to

450
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
sponsor me with this to figure this out

451
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,199
so i actually went to fiverr i don't

452
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,639
know if you know fiverr the name stands

453
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
for five normally you pay five dollars

454
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,440
for someone to do something for you

455
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
it's in reality not always five dollars

456
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
but i just posted the thing there hey i

457
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
have this

458
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
i think super difficult math problem

459
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
with a drawing on it literally that

460
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,800
drawing

461
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,720
these are the stuff who can help me

462
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
write

463
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
the math so i can actually understand

464
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
angles towards coordinates because

465
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,120
that's really what i was asked for and

466
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
some really nice guy i think from

467
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
australia said yeah for 12 euros

468
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,000
i'll i'll do that for you well said

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
i don't have to do my own i don't know

470
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
if this is cheating with hacking but uh

471
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,199
if someone is willing to give me this

472
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
math stuff for 12 euros

473
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
go for it and the guy actually spent two

474
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,959
three days on it we had a long

475
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,199
conversation i was every time he came

476
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
back with his math thing i was trying it

477
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
out and the picture didn't really but we

478
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
sorted it out

479
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,639
in a couple of days and we really got

480
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,360
some really um it's very clean code on

481
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
how to actually get

482
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,759
from angles to x y

483
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
uh location and also the other way

484
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,279
around

485
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,320
um

486
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
from x y um to to angles because that's

487
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
in the end actually what i wanted if i

488
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
want to make a drawing

489
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
i can take any jpeg

490
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
and then i want to say well i i on x y i

491
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,399
want the thing to go down but what

492
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,680
angles does that represent now

493
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
unfortunately that way back reverse

494
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
is not one-way street

495
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
if you imagine i can move my arms in

496
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
multiple ways while this point still

497
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,079
stays at the same thing so i just brute

498
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
force that i just

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
figure out on all dots what the angle

500
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,680
should be had a map for that and and

501
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,959
figure that out so i actually wrote a

502
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,640
piece of software then to

503
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
take an image i could draw a line over

504
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,280
the image in my case pikachu of course

505
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
and started writing the steps down but

506
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,919
again

507
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
my newborn friend from canada was

508
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,520
working with me on this project as well

509
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,240
i wrote my program in a net windows

510
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
program

511
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
he did a much better job

512
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
emo wrote something web-based

513
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
and we have now a quincy online editor

514
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,600
where you can go online and you can

515
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
upload an image and you can make this

516
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
that you have to trace it

517
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,600
because you you can't auto trace

518
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,520
well technically of course you could but

519
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,919
what you want is you wanted to say okay

520
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,840
this is step one if you wanted to also

521
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
be an educational tool on how to draw on

522
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
that kind of stuff

523
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
but for me that wasn't the quest for me

524
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,320
it was just about getting my kid to be

525
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
happy so

526
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,000
started in may this is in november

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
i showed him the robot we tossed it a

528
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
different card

529
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
and

530
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,160
magically as what he asked took a few

531
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,039
months lots of complicated math

532
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,000
um

533
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,679
but it did drew

534
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,280
pikachu uh what he really wanted and of

535
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
course kids they're like wow oh

536
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
fantastic um

537
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
he was very happy i did it in the end

538
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,879
for his smile

539
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
see that that's what as a dad what you

540
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
do it for the kid is happy

541
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
he doesn't appreciate really how

542
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
difficult it was or whatsoever he moved

543
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,360
on to the next project he didn't care

544
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
anymore whatsoever because it was six

545
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
months later or something like that

546
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
um but for me it was a fun journey i i

547
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
met new people i did learn

548
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
a little bit about bath a little bit

549
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
more

550
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
and it was really really really nice

551
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,559
and that's why we want to share this

552
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,080
with you right i mean it's not about you

553
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
having to hack this robot if you do

554
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,679
things and that kind of stuff one thing

555
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,280
i really recommend is always when you do

556
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,559
projects share

557
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
on all my projects i've always getting

558
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
so much nice feedback but also

559
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
interaction on other people's ideas and

560
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
it really evolves the project and that

561
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,080
kind of stuff so using

562
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,760
instructables.com use a github

563
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,720
use a thingy first um

564
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
whatever stuff you find lots of things

565
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
that i design on thingiverse as well

566
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
and i always get a lot of feedback from

567
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
that as well so it's very valuable to

568
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
share things and yeah when things do get

569
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
hard

570
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,960
don't cheat don't bill out just go cheat

571
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
and get help and if you have to pay 12

572
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
euros for it go pay 12 euros for it i

573
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,559
guess

574
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
it helped me moved on my my project

575
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
so that was my experience about this

576
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,760
thing and of course i wanted to give you

577
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
guys a chance to to win one of these

578
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
things or two i actually have two so

579
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
we're going to do

580
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
if the screen

581
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,000
works

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
i guess we have to cancel out of this

583
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
there we go we're going to do a little

584
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,200
kahoot

585
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
three questions that's going to be short

586
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,840
so i don't know if you all know kahoot

587
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
you go on your phone you go to cahoot.it

588
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
if you happen to have the app

589
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,159
um you don't have to tell your real name

590
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
you can be any name as long as you later

591
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
can show me that you're you that you're

592
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,840
that person if you win type in the code

593
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,400
uh we do three questions in the top two

594
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
and we'll automatically get um well you

595
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,039
will well you can come pick up your

596
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
quincy drawing robot

597
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,559
let's see

598
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,679
i hope you all have good connectivity

599
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,600
i for one in 21

600
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
almost

601
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
good to go

602
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,440
no almost

603
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,320
now

604
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,679
hint

605
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,799
the questions are of course about robots

606
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,159
so don't know how much you know about

607
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,400
robots

608
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
good to go

609
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
no

610
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
slow phone

611
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
yes good to go

612
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,840
okido there we go so uh it is about so

613
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
three questions uh you get points for

614
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,760
scoring the right answer but you get

615
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
even more points for scoring faster the

616
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,480
right answer so don't want to rush you

617
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
because the wrong answer doesn't give

618
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,159
you points but there we go um

619
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
so first question you answer it on your

620
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,159
phone

621
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
where was the word robot first used was

622
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,559
that in an ancient manuscript in a play

623
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,520
in a science research paper or in a news

624
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,799
article

625
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,360
where was the word robot

626
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
first used

627
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,679
i think it was somewhere in the 1928

628
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,200
time frame

629
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
something like that

630
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
it was uh yeah it's not real it was a

631
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,840
slavic or something it's not a country

632
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
it's a dialect but in russia area

633
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,080
and it was in a play in a play about

634
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
human slavery

635
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
to to mechanics or something like that

636
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,559
uh

637
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,760
okay so you still have champs don't

638
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
worry two other questions coming um

639
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,559
number two

640
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,520
who wrote the famous robot law right on

641
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,159
robot should obey should not hurt human

642
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
beings and should try to keep itself

643
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,600
alive

644
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
is that isaac

645
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,400
asimov is that isaac newton

646
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,679
hiroshi

647
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,679
ishii guru or tom baker

648
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,840
wow good guess everyone

649
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,039
all the other ones do have something to

650
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
do with robots by the way uh i'll let

651
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,039
you figure that out

652
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,320
there we go

653
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
see if there's

654
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
still many people in the top so final

655
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
final final question

656
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
there we go

657
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
what is the name of the robot in the

658
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,919
movie short circuit is that the t100 the

659
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,559
t200 johnny number three or johnny

660
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,960
number five

661
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,919
oh many people like terminator i guess

662
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
t200 is a terminator they kill people

663
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
it's not a drawing robot or a funny

664
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
robot it is of course johnny number five

665
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
so

666
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,039
we'll see number three but unfortunately

667
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,640
number three i only have two so sorry

668
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,520
