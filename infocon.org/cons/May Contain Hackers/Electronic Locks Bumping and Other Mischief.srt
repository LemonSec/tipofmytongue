00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,680
hello I'm Michael

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,260
um and this is my 2022 talk about

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
electronic locks and

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,420
I see some familiar faces here but not

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,760
everybody knows me so I'll quickly

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,980
introduce myself so

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,500
um what is it about this guy and why is

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,800
he always talking about locks for me

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,399
this lock story goes way way back when I

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,160
was a like a little boy

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
um my great grandfather was supposed to

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,320
make me a key to the apartment so I can

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,239
get back into the apartment of the

15
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,460
school and he did not give me key he

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
gave me this

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,120
um this is called Dietrich in German

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,620
and it opens more than one lock of

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,840
course and somehow this all started for

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,339
me

21
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,880
um later when lock sport became a thing

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,299
I started to compete in lockspot as well

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,460
but this will be probably the only

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,259
picture you'll ever see of me of winning

25
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,439
any major price I'm not the fast guy a

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,040
Modi analytics guy so I wrote a number

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
of papers about locks publish them you

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,560
can find them there

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,479
obviously I do conference talks now and

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,159
then some of them were recorded some of

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,200
those are on YouTube and

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
um I made a playlist for this and then

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,140
yeah software and electronics

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,659
my father often predicted I'd become a

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,259
locksmith but I also found that I like

36
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,420
to take apart electronics and write

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,399
software and so on so I I became an

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,100
engineer I do my living in with software

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,240
development and as a personal project I

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,219
made an app that may help you if you

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,540
have an Android device and use this

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,520
Bluetooth covered warning app but now

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,119
let's look at the locks so to make it a

44
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,580
little bit easier to follow this talk

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,120
I made a like four segments obviously

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,160
electronic locks are electromechanical

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,680
systems so you can attack the mechanics

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
part or the electronics and software

49
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,700
part and also to sort it a little bit

50
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,940
there are generic attacks that works on

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,099
that work maybe on many locks and then

52
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,620
also very log-specific attacks

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,080
as an example it would be like what I

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
will show most bumping

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
it's very generic it attacks the

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,260
mechanical part there are other ways

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,400
that you could do it magnets are

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
typically something

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,540
and other attacks electronics and

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,860
software there's a lot

61
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,860
of attack surface but it is typically

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,840
very log specific for one specific

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,860
system

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,620
and yeah some of the things are generic

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,440
if RFID keys can be copied and you know

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,500
that okay start with bumping you have

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
heard about dumping I'm very sure for

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,300
mechanical locks

69
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,360
um there was a

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,019
patent early in 1926 and then in the

71
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,360
early 2000s it was made public again and

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,459
also

73
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,840
by some people here in the Netherlands

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,879
there was a Bahrain drop from Tool and

75
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,340
wrote a paper about it and what you

76
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,400
probably also know is bumping cheap

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
electronic safes so that is a well-known

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
technique you can use a potato or a fist

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,379
or whatever and here you see Ray bumping

80
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,739
uh open a safe at Munich CCC so you

81
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,379
probably have seen that right and most

82
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,760
of

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,580
um people who know something about locks

84
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,980
also know that this is because of the

85
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,700
solenoid and these cheap saves

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,379
and yeah they have become an

87
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,840
anti-pattern in mechanical lock design

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,459
or an electronic lock design because

89
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,860
they are so easy to manipulate from the

90
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,480
outside

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,260
um

92
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,640
so people generally accept that Motors

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,220
are a more secure way to to lock

94
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,500
something

95
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
um okay

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,459
but I did find a modern lock with the

97
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,880
solenoid and this is now a lock specific

98
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,500
mechanical attack

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,479
on

100
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,219
a very specific lock

101
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,040
this uh it's a

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,500
mechanical

103
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,340
electromechanical lock with mechanical

104
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,960
keys and the keys also have like a

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,060
little ship in there and electrical

106
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,280
contacts that you can see

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
here

108
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,460
um here I actually covered them up with

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,979
a little bit of tape and just by the way

110
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,040
in this presentation I typically put the

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,660
left side of the picture is like the

112
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,639
secure side on the inside of the door

113
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,979
and on the right side of the picture is

114
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,740
like the outside and in this case you

115
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,360
would have the key on the outside and a

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,300
knob on the inside

117
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,400
this lock works with batteries on the

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,759
inside knob and then there is a solenoid

119
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,639
and I think it was designed with a

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,400
solenoid because solenoids are fast if

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,919
you think of a little

122
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,800
leads through that would move this pen

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,080
up that may take too much time

124
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,539
yeah let's try it out so

125
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,060
I can you can see that now right yeah

126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,220
very good

127
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,600
uh okay so

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,060
this is the correct key

129
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,000
it will be once and now I can turn it

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,780
this is the modify key with the pins

131
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,419
covered the lock does not know it's in

132
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,360
there now but it doesn't know

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,240
uh once I start turning

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,620
you know

135
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm supposed to

136
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,759
demonstration work too early

137
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,860
so basically if I start turning it will

138
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,539
not fire the solenoid and I cannot turn

139
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,440
any further okay so but if I turn really

140
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,539
quickly and I know I can do that I'm not

141
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,520
sure if I can do it live on stage let's

142
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,180
try yes I can also turn it quickly

143
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,520
I mean it does beep but it also opens

144
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,460
the door so so much for locking out the

145
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,599
person you don't trust anymore

146
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,360
okay

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,979
um

148
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,100
no bumping

149
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,800
bumping as we said the solenoid is bad

150
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,319
let's use a proper motor

151
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,800
this little key safe I have it here uh

152
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,840
actually does have a motor

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
and this motor

154
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,660
pushes down on a spring-loaded latch

155
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,360
so it's convenient you can close it and

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
the Sledge will close but

157
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,599
um yeah you can also do the same thing

158
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,880
as with the cheap safe and this has a

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,259
nice time uh time delay thing to it so I

160
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,800
I like to do that I can also yeah but I

161
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,900
don't do it on stage here

162
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,840
um to be fair the manufacturer has or

163
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,460
I'm not sure if there's only one but

164
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,860
they have improved it and there is now a

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,800
little uh function that the motor turns

166
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,020
the other way around when it sensors it

167
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,259
close and then now this attack doesn't

168
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,639
work on the new versions of those

169
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,199
anymore so I like that when

170
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,580
manufacturers actually improve the

171
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,599
product

172
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,419
uh okay but now we know

173
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,919
it is

174
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
the spring is the problem it's not to

175
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,020
have a motor or a solenoid it is this

176
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,419
coupling or this blocking is um

177
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,220
typically a mass spring and mass system

178
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,660
and

179
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,199
um I mean you know spring and Mars or so

180
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,720
subsystems like that if you want to

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,580
um if you want to do something from the

182
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,080
outside you can just hit it and now a

183
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,539
collision happens you know you know this

184
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,060
thing is called Newton's Cradle

185
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,720
uh you hit from the outside and if there

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,580
are collisions then this energy will be

187
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,900
transferred and it's called con

188
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,780
conservation of momentum for example the

189
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,979
other thing that you can do from the

190
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,080
outside if you cannot reach um this and

191
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,720
it's like isolated now you can actually

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,840
use inertia so you just hit it from the

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,539
side it will still start moving and if

194
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,179
you hit it multiple times it will

195
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,380
actually there will be a resonance

196
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,899
frequency and so on so you may actually

197
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,120
be able to to hit it even

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,860
uh harder so let's test

199
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,620
this Theory

200
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,420
um for this because I cannot zoom it

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,860
would be cool if we could switch to the

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,480
other camera please

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
and

204
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,880
um have a look at this cylinder

205
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,380
and this lock

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,740
so as you know

207
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,040
these mechanical electromechanical lock

208
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,140
cylinders work like this you have on the

209
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,500
inside the opportunity to to open close

210
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,420
the boat

211
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,760
but on the outside you can only do that

212
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,339
after authentication so because then the

213
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,720
motor will move something and so now

214
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
it's free spinning and it's secure

215
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,660
suppose it's secure okay let's see I

216
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,100
think we can we can see it on camera

217
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,380
right yeah

218
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,120
okay so it will be a little bit loud but

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
normally for a short time and you have

220
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,839
to watch this

221
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,380
see that it moves in

222
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,360
yeah open

223
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,200
okay okay

224
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,980
we will have another demonstration later

225
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,019
with the other locks but let's have a

226
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,640
look at them first

227
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,339
so the theory was this

228
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,279
um just so you see what what I just did

229
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,100
is I attacked this lock cylinder

230
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,959
this is a very

231
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,519
complicated system where all the

232
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,380
electronics are on the ice outside of

233
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,320
the door including a magnetic override

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,500
key and you can use a RFID chip and

235
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,660
everything

236
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,240
but yeah it also has a spring loaded

237
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
clutch an axial spring-loaded clutch

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,820
element

239
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,200
okay and there are typically some

240
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
questions or frequently asked questions

241
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,140
the first one is why test this in the

242
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,100
door

243
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,079
some people in Germany will now be angry

244
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,240
with me because log sport ethics say you

245
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,800
should not attack the door you should

246
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,320
only attack a lock and this way it

247
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,760
doesn't look like we are thieves and

248
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,220
want to break in the only problem with

249
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,399
that is you cannot have a real

250
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,180
um

251
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,579
test if you just hold the cylinder in

252
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,200
your hand

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,860
um

254
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,920
I want to show you with this cylinder

255
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,959
here this is an electronic lock signal

256
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,060
that is not vulnerable to these attacks

257
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,980
at least I didn't

258
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,980
yet

259
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,500
um but you can see that this cam that's

260
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,560
a thing that operates the the bolt it

261
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,180
actually turns even though I didn't put

262
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,940
the key here the thing is though if I

263
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,440
put my finger here

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,300
you see it does not turn so there's a

265
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,060
slip clutch and that is now a way to

266
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,360
design it in a way that it will not open

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
the door lock with if you don't

268
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,240
authenticate it but to test whether this

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,180
attack works you have to put some you

270
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,980
have to prove that you can really

271
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,700
transmit torque to the cam

272
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,260
uh the other thing that you may think of

273
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,660
if you look at this is don't put this

274
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,480
into a into a lock where you don't need

275
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,760
much torque so if you have like a key

276
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,279
switch that maybe doesn't need much

277
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,260
torque to activate then this is not the

278
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,899
right lock for it or if you have like a

279
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,560
thing that just blocks

280
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,240
based on the cam like

281
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
um like a little safe

282
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,860
something like that you can easily know

283
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,440
here you know this type of thing you can

284
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,000
easily pull it out if you can just move

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,220
the cam without torque but yeah that's

286
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,860
the reason why we have to put it into a

287
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,540
simulated door or something like that

288
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,100
um I cannot oh sorry okay

289
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,200
um the other question is

290
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,660
if there is a motor like a heat screw or

291
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,200
whatever why is there a spring inside if

292
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,079
it just were like a fixed motor lead

293
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,560
screw drive there's no problem with uh

294
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
moving that right

295
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,620
um but

296
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,220
um

297
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
if you design a system like that you you

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,760
will see that you have to

299
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,560
engage the clutch at all the angles even

300
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
at those where where the things don't

301
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,060
match like the both sides don't match so

302
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,040
now the motor can actually put the

303
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,320
energy into the spring and then once you

304
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,060
turn it it will actually engage the

305
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,420
clutch and the other way around if um

306
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,480
you hold the knob and retract for

307
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,940
example the latch

308
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,040
uh put much talk on the

309
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,740
on on the clutch then it cannot

310
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,360
disengage so that's why there are

311
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,300
usually Springs

312
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,100
uh yeah the only problem with that is if

313
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,899
they are actual then we can use the

314
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,380
hammer the rotary hammer to to do that

315
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,720
and then another question would be why

316
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,459
are the Springs weak

317
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,339
and that's because if they are really

318
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,600
strong

319
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,620
then it takes a lot of battery power

320
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,079
right

321
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,180
other things and as I hear from vendors

322
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,480
of these locks is yeah it's not a silent

323
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,240
attack and you if you do it more often

324
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,220
you see

325
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,839
scratches and stuff like that

326
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,019
uh that that's maybe true if your luck

327
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,420
is not meant to secure anything really

328
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,699
but just like make sure that honest

329
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,620
people stay honest then it may be fine

330
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,620
but uh if I buy some lock that is

331
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,839
supposed to have like 10 minutes drill

332
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,279
resistant from uh has a SK G three star

333
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,980
rating and so on I expect it to resist

334
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,480
for some minutes and not a few seconds

335
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,339
uh and then also the other thing and we

336
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,959
have seen that today when we did the dry

337
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,779
run uh if you do it too often maybe you

338
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,760
put too much energy into the lock and it

339
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,220
will fail and that is really annoying

340
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,920
for me as the pen tester but um I mean

341
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,680
still if it opens the first time

342
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,240
somebody wants to attack my lock

343
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,260
it's it's still not a good thing okay uh

344
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,060
there is one thing that I think it

345
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,519
should be kind of part of the um

346
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,740
training of lock designers you should

347
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,800
not use actually spring-loaded clutch

348
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,060
elements

349
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,380
okay uh I will demo other logs soon and

350
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,880
these are the logs that I want to show

351
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
you this is where the whole thing

352
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,740
started this is a really old lock from a

353
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,459
um

354
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,959
from a manufacturer like I don't know 15

355
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,199
years ago it's really old 20 years ago

356
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
um and they have two more Generations in

357
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
the meantime that are not vulnerable to

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,779
this but I I want to show it briefly and

359
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,579
this actually does have a solenoid in

360
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,860
here so it's like just if you hit on it

361
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,540
it will move and

362
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,720
yeah so that's the first one so it has a

363
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,440
solenoid blade um bass clutch then a

364
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
lock with a weird sorry with a wired

365
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,839
electronic key

366
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,699
um

367
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,579
that one when I took it apart and looked

368
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,500
at it it looks like the clutch is

369
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,620
actually radially meaning coming out of

370
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
this which would be good

371
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,259
you could have the on its own problem if

372
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,660
you turn it really fast then like um

373
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,480
centrifugal force which um

374
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,820
would maybe pull it out but that's not

375
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,399
the case they designed it well

376
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,120
um however there is also a part of the

377
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,800
movement is actually and that's why it's

378
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,860
also falling to this

379
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,000
um

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,560
yes but

381
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,560
why we look at this lock I promise some

382
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,519
other things than bumping other mischief

383
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,940
this also has bad crypto and a Time

384
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,660
penalty bug yeah so

385
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,820
um

386
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,220
the the vendor says the key is read and

387
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,079
copy protected through cryptologically

388
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
and crypto dialogue procedure uh but

389
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,740
that was like invented

390
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,920
Home Road crypto by somebody uh 20 years

391
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,940
ago

392
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,100
and if you look at the key you also see

393
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,180
this is just a little pick

394
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,259
microcontroller so what would you expect

395
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,839
let's have a look right so do a standard

396
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,360
reverse engineering procedure would be

397
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
uh look is a logic analyzer to record

398
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
the transactions I use the layer logic

399
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,579
and then look and you see the physical

400
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,900
layer and the physical layer is really

401
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,660
simple it's like a zero and then the bit

402
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,640
and then the one and the zero next bit

403
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,819
and the one you can write for this type

404
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,380
of logical as you can write a low level

405
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,140
analyzer and then you see the bits

406
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,199
figure out it's 40 bits Challenge and

407
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,860
response

408
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,840
then tnz is something like an Arduino

409
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,059
but faster

410
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,580
made an analyzer with wrote some

411
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,799
software for that

412
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,720
and then we could actually understand

413
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,760
the encryption and we'll look at this on

414
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,980
the next slide but once that is done we

415
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,900
can also simulate the key and then copy

416
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,980
the keys

417
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,799
and then while doing that

418
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,820
um

419
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,500
this cylinder has a knob with digits and

420
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,120
you can join it and then you push it and

421
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,740
turn and push it and turn it pushes you

422
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,840
can do four digits five digits or six

423
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
digits code that way and it turned out

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,580
that if the codes were four or five

425
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,640
digits and we entered it through the key

426
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,100
interface then it wouldn't have a Time

427
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,240
penalty

428
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,340
meaning you could easily brute force it

429
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,900
by just trying out all the four digit

430
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,720
codes in short time so that one the

431
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,120
vendor has fixed in new firmware

432
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
releases which are well the whole system

433
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,559
is not updatable but if you buy a new

434
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,020
cylinder like this now it won't have the

435
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,660
time penalty bucket anymore

436
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,700
uh let's look at the crypto so I chose

437
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,620
this picture uh people who stare at bits

438
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,980
and at this time I also want to thank

439
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,900
nice people from UCC and as a staff for

440
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,679
being such a nice aspiring partners and

441
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,380
inspiration so thank you

442
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,840
and all the others uh we did this

443
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,580
hasn't Gypsy session during the pandemic

444
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
and stared at bits uh so on the left

445
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,200
side you see the challenge

446
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,660
on the right side you see the response

447
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,020
bits and what you can already see is

448
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,960
like if you look at cases where only one

449
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,539
bit flips here

450
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,780
not much happens on the right side and

451
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,620
uh Chloe Shannon wrote about gertography

452
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,900
um called this diffusion

453
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,360
the the single bit change should change

454
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,740
more bits on the right side so if you

455
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,660
see this already you have an idea that

456
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,480
something is doesn't seem to be right

457
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,940
uh and if you look more closely and I'm

458
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,380
not sure if you can see it here but I

459
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,660
highlight that the change bits and both

460
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,799
print and you can see that it is uh six

461
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,780
bits changing and they're always at the

462
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,960
same site and that is very much looking

463
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,820
like a linear feedback shift register

464
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,980
and it's actually

465
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,900
um a little bit more complicated than

466
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,500
that but and it's too linear

467
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,600
lfsrs and that's it so now that we

468
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
understand it you just need to have one

469
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,700
single transaction and you can get the

470
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,280
secret of this key

471
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
good so that was about uh cryptography

472
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,159
attacks if you will want to call it like

473
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:17,940
that

474
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,720
uh bumping again another lock

475
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,960
this is a very strong smart lock

476
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,460
cylinder

477
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,520
uh and this is designed very well

478
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,980
because all the electronics parts are on

479
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,960
the inside of the door and there's only

480
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,940
some strong metal on the outside on the

481
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,600
door of the door in strong

482
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,780
protection and you see the skg three

483
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,820
star sign here

484
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,380
so

485
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,960
um yeah that is a strong lock

486
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,720
taken it apart you can see that there

487
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
are

488
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,419
um

489
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,600
actually spring-loaded pins clutch pins

490
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,360
yeah that's the problem of course

491
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,000
um if you look at this knob you see

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,100
there is like on the left picture these

493
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,559
pins are not engaged but on the right

494
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,059
side they came out

495
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,720
zooming in so now they are out in oh no

496
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,120
it's coupled in out here you can see

497
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,620
that

498
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,940
um

499
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,039
yeah and that's the problem that we'll

500
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,720
see when we bump it

501
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,480
um okay there's a very similar design by

502
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,880
another manufacturer this one even has a

503
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,500
mechanical override

504
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,340
um

505
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,940
down here it's really neat design but um

506
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,720
same problem

507
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,919
okay uh uh then the locks I've I've

508
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,900
shown before they are quite expensive

509
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,100
like a few hundred euros per piece

510
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,600
there's also cheap electronic lock

511
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,720
cylinders that you can import from Asia

512
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,299
typically

513
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,720
and yeah this one has a lead screw based

514
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,620
clutch

515
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,520
mechanism again but spring loaded and

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,559
all the electronics on the outside of

517
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,460
the knob

518
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,980
uh there are actually Four General sorry

519
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,140
two generations of them

520
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,820
pretty similar but slightly different

521
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,400
and then a completely different Next

522
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,080
Generation has actually two little

523
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,179
Motors in here it's really nice like a

524
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,380
redundant thing

525
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,440
there's two of them one can be activated

526
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
through Bluetooth and the other one you

527
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,520
have to connect the USB override thing

528
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,159
but I mean both of them actually have

529
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,419
the problem we

530
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,960
've seen

531
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,799
I took one apart it's turned around now

532
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,380
uh I made a slow motion sequence so you

533
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,480
can at the right side of the picture

534
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,659
in which if you can see it here but

535
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,919
um

536
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
there is this clutch part and you can

537
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
even see that the little pin stuck out

538
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,080
from last attempt here and here you can

539
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,799
see that painted is black and if when

540
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,520
the when the pin jumps out you see this

541
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,340
black covered yeah let's see how much we

542
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,659
can

543
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,580
is another Hammer comes from the left

544
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,700
and the whole thing moves and you see

545
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,500
the pin coming out now

546
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
and now it is back again but it's

547
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,240
um

548
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,860
jumping a little bit back and forth so

549
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,299
that is what hap what's happening in

550
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,039
there obviously

551
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,159
and now let's have the camera switched

552
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,700
again please and we just do it live

553
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,559
again on

554
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,399
on these locks

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,240
so number two is the very basic one with

556
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,960
the solenoid

557
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
um

558
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,159
we'll see so uh one thing I want to tell

559
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,440
you I didn't make many of these uh

560
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,000
little mini doors I made a little

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,179
demonstrating things instead and you can

562
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,220
see here's a white wheel with a black

563
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,240
tooth

564
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,059
and this is to prove that the clutch or

565
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,520
the cam was actually transmitting enough

566
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,659
Force

567
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,419
to turn it so after the attack the

568
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,340
little black tooth will not be at the

569
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,020
top but will be moved and then you know

570
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,659
that it would have opened the door yeah

571
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,620
okay let's try open

572
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,179
um this one I didn't put the expensive

573
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,400
knob with the key interface and this

574
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,500
code entry on there but just a little

575
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,840
brass piece so don't destroy the

576
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,940
expensive knob

577
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,360
open

578
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,039
uh

579
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,919
that's the strong one with the skg three

580
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,159
stars

581
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,679
into this really strong maybe let's see

582
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,919
foreign

583
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:57,650
[Music]

584
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,600
to keep that in

585
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,039
hmm

586
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,360
let's try once more

587
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,600
open

588
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,419
okay then we have this other very

589
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,419
similar One open

590
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,700
and now we come to the cheaper versions

591
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,380
yeah

592
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
open

593
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,640
open

594
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,020
okay

595
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,640
getting there one last

596
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,640
open okay

597
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,000
[Music]

598
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,179
okay so I have a feeling like uh there

599
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,860
was a German TV show called baton dust

600
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,320
and I just uh

601
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,980
okay uh how if you want to try it

602
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,120
yourself

603
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,980
um what you need is a strong rotary

604
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,480
hammer

605
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
um it needs to be a rotary hammer not

606
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
just a hammer drill so there's this

607
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,740
electromatic thing that really puts some

608
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,159
Jewel of energy into each of the hits so

609
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,799
this one does two joules a very cheap

610
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,400
one imported to then go to AliExpress or

611
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,740
whatever does about 1.5 although they

612
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,440
claim more and this one is also you get

613
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,539
it at Aldi or little learnson and has

614
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,640
like one Jewel and for many of them it

615
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,659
works

616
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,000
you would need something like an adapter

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,740
because if you just use the typical

618
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,960
Hammer like the typical drill bit you

619
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,460
will drill a hole but you need something

620
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
that distributes the force of a more

621
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
surface

622
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,039
and I made TPU covers with three

623
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,900
millimeter TPU

624
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,980
and then you can either use duct tape to

625
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,220
to tape it to the knob or what I did is

626
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,900
I did some adapters with different

627
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,440
diameters okay some little other massive

628
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,779
I promised uh

629
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,380
yeah I wanted to buy a time lock

630
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,840
for a certain reason I will show you but

631
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,980
it turned out this is a sex toy but

632
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,320
anyway the attack is called fault

633
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,500
injection and the thing is you can reset

634
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
some very cheap electronics with this

635
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,419
EMP device yeah that is sold to as a

636
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,039
advertise that the device that makes

637
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,980
slot machines pay out money but it can

638
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,100
really only disturb or reset only the

639
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,840
cheapest of electronics like this locket

640
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,039
doesn't work

641
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,140
uh and obviously maybe there's some

642
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,059
other some outside there are some

643
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,620
Chinese locks that is effective against

644
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,179
and then there's a lot of ads where it

645
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,039
says and it's not effective against this

646
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,940
something that is effective sometimes is

647
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,059
a rotating magnet and if you look at how

648
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,320
to influence the motor from the outside

649
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,179
what you could do is if you have a

650
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,740
really strong magnetic field you could

651
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,779
actually superimpose that over the

652
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,059
existing magnetic field and then

653
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,140
the motor will turn the other way around

654
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,740
um

655
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,100
the other thing you can do is pull

656
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,080
the Ivan core

657
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,460
of the magnet of the motor so I got this

658
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,799
time lock now it's set to 33 minutes

659
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,840
still so it doesn't open you cannot push

660
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,059
this button in but here I have a magnet

661
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,279
it's north post Hospital on these sides

662
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,220
diameterally magnetized and if I just

663
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,559
put this here and turn it

664
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,539
uh I can now open the lock right and I

665
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,559
can also close it again yeah okay

666
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,480
um

667
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,860
what else yeah this was pulling

668
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,159
um if the Mac if the motor is inside the

669
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,860
knob and you turn it really fast you may

670
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,200
be able to use centrifugal force or if

671
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,899
you do acceleration acceleration inertia

672
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:03,720
to actually turn something okay
