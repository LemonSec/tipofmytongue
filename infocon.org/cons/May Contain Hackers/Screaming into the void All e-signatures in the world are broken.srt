2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,800
again welcome back to day two of mch

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
2022

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,119
um as you probably all know over the

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,080
last

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
last few years all over the world

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
electronically signed

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
artifacts let's call it that became

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,280
commonplace even in emerging digital

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
countries like germany

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
but if you combine these with

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,559
dynamic contact this usually leads to

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
disaster so instead of screaming into

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
the void

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
please welcome on stage curiels to talk

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,559
about all

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
e-signatures in the world are broken

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
thank you

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
thank you everybody

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
so

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,280
the last presentation i did before kobit

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
uh i was gonna do before kobit was

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
actually called travel for hackers how

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel the world easily and then for

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
three years we were all stuck wherever

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
we are so this is my first presentation

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,400
abroad

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,360
since covid hope i'm not too rusty

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
anyway this is me if you can if you can

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
see the screen i sure can't

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
um i work in a couple places but most

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
importantly um i am a hacker even though

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
i do manage my own company on today day

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
basis i still like to hack

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
many of the things i'm going to talk

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,680
about are available on my presentation

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,360
site girls.org if you want to take a

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,240
look at them later on

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
some of the research that i've done in

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
the past and that i'm currently involved

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
in besides this presentation here

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
in 2017 when google published their

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,600
research on shattered

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
which is the they practically

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
demonstrated the collisions of one

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
function

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
um i took the opportunity to show to the

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
latvian government that it's that is a

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
thing and those of you who took a look

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
at the

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,680
exploit that google created even though

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,480
they did not initially publish the tool

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,879
they used to do that it was really easy

54
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,120
to repurpose it and basically create

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,560
any two different pdf documents with the

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
same

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
sah one sum

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
a different project that we're working

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,599
on right now is variable security um

60
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
it's a cool project you're probably

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
going to hear about it in a year or two

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
and when we're done with it so we're

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,799
trying to

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,440
make sure that the devices that people

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
were are safe anyway

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
this talk here

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
really important thing i want to

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
communicate here now most of you here

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,560
are

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
hackers i would guess many of you are

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,599
technical

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
i'm hoping that we do have some

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
management people if not in the room

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
yeah ah there we go uh then online as

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,640
well

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
and

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,319
with this talk i want to bridge

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
the gap between the technical people and

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
the management people because as you

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
will see that is what i think

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
is what we need to actually fix

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
the problem and the problem isn't

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
new on a technical level it's been

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,720
discussed

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
on different mailing lists as long as 10

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
years ago

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
but we decided to

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,879
revisit the problem because covet right

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
then during covet

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
as harold angel told you

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
we did have people using more and more

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
digital technologies people companies

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
government agencies that

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
did not

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
use them before

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
and that kind of brought up

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
this problem

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,480
so

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
for the management people online and in

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,040
the room

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,159
uh how do signatures work

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,680
um that's

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,720
can you actually see that yeah

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
you can oh yeah you have smaller screens

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
that's good

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
basically we take data

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
we hash it using for example let's say

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
h1 or

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
maybe a more secure version of it

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
and then we sign it using cryptographic

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,040
function using uh we use public and

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
private key to sign it and then verify

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
it right and the certificate is what

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
proves that you are you right government

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
could for example give out that

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
certificate to every person and then

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
they could sign it

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
so what we are actually signing is the

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
hash not the actual document right

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,520
but what's more important for this

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,199
presentation and this

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
vulnerability

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,600
is

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
we are hashing

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
the bits we are hashing the bits in the

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
file we are not actually signing what we

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
see on the screen and that's basically

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
the whole concept here

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
even though we may see one thing

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
the same bits might later turn out to be

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
something else

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
now

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
there are

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
many different

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
schemes

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
that can be used for

137
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
signing in european union uh some of the

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
most popular ones de facto we have pdf

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
with embedded signatures i hate it but

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
it's there

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
we have asica

142
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,560
which is a container uh in latvia we

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
also have edoc which is basically the

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
same the the overall structure is the

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
same now since this is a container

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
or a compound file we can actually take

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
a look

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
inside it and

149
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,479
it's

150
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
it's it's really easy how it works but

151
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
one more thing with compound files is

152
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
that

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,759
you can put anything in it and

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
it's it's not a hacker thing it's not

155
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
that you can hack the government you can

156
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,759
hack the system and you can sign

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,720
um

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
let's say a jpeg or

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
you can sign dot mp3

160
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
it's intentional

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
european union uh strongly holds that

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,319
for asiki containers

163
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,840
citizens should be able to sign any

164
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,880
data and that opens huge pandora's box

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
in my opinion for example

166
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
i could sign

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
let's say an iso file

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
that an iso file can be interpreted in

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
many different ways as you know

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
i could even sign an elf file

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
a program that every time you launch it

172
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
it displays a different

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
content a different document

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
and it is

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,880
perfectly legal just because in the real

176
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
life this is much more complicated than

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,479
just having a document

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,160
now that's where dynamic content comes

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
in

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
dynamic content are files not signed

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
non-signed files where the

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
representation changes due to some

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,120
factors without bits changing

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,599
for example we could use dynamic only

185
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
objects in word document

186
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,440
dynamical objects are these things where

187
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
you can put in a formula

188
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,400
or you can put in a different dynamic

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
perspective into the object and it

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
basically changes every time you open

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
the file uh it can even change

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
when the file is open like this file

193
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,039
right here

194
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,919
uh that's a gif obviously right we all

195
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,919
remember gifts from the or jif so if

196
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
you're in that that that part of the

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
debate um we all remember those from

198
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,400
20 30 years ago of course

199
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
but what you can do is obviously you can

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
make the first frame stay there for 20

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
seconds for 10 minutes for

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
maybe even longer i'm not sure what the

203
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
what what the accent is there for that

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,919
one

205
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
so it can change after a while

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
we also have static object pre-renders

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
going back to

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
office documents

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
now most office standards including

210
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
docx by microsoft

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
support or rather demands that when you

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
use any new features that you embed in

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
the document

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
the program you use to make the file

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
with also creates a preview which is

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
basically a graphic static graphic file

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
for that object

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
now when you open such a document with a

219
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
modern software

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
the object loads if you open it is

221
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
old software doesn't support it you see

222
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
the preview

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
obviously libreoffice microsoft is they

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
generate automatically but if you go

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,599
inside the file you can change it

226
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
manually and then you get different

227
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
things for different uh different

228
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
viewers

229
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
now remote content

230
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,719
is super interesting

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,519
remote contents means just in just as in

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
html pages you can load the remote image

233
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
for example or a remote iframe

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,719
in your document so you open it up

235
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,240
and this loads from the internet and not

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
only you can actually get dynamic

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
content that way you can also of course

238
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,959
track

239
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
document being open and you can also

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
decide what is going to display post

241
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
post sending the document right instead

242
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,399
of thinking ahead you just have this

243
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
link and then in a year or two you just

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
change the content um so those are all

245
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
real real attacks right and these are

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
for classic document formats

247
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
um for other formats like gif or elf

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
that i mentioned you can go even even

249
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,279
further

250
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
um i'm going to show you

251
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,920
how it looks and once again it all works

252
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
because we sign the bits

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
not what we see on the screen

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
so i have a couple things here uh first

255
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
of all the gif file of course it's 613

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
bytes so it's

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,040
less than half a dozen half a kilobyte

258
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
just just a gif right uh for this one

259
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,000
here i i made it to change in 20 seconds

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
of course you could have text on it

261
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
and so on

262
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
now

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
let's take a look at the dynamic content

264
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
here's a

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
docx right if i open it up it's not

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,760
signed

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,880
the file is inside if i open it up

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
it opens on my other screen

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
but basically what we have here

270
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
is a sentence

271
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
and we didn't spend the time to

272
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
actually

273
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
make it look believable right but

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
basically what happens here is it says

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
john will pay

276
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
peter this amount of money right john

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
will pay peter if we close the document

278
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
right here

279
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,399
and we try opening it again

280
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
we once again have john will pay peter

281
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
and if we open it again we have peter

282
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
will pay john right so

283
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
this document could be signed and we

284
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
actually signed it and send it to the

285
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
government

286
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
to just just to prove the point and uh

287
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
then it's hard to know what what happens

288
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
afterwards right uh how it's happening

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
is quite easy i extracted the dockets

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
here as you know dockex are also

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
compound files which means you can just

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
rename them to zip and open it up

293
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,360
and this is what's inside right

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
so if we take a look here

295
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
we have this embeddings right and

296
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
it's basically just an excel file in

297
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
this case

298
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
which has this great formula right here

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
which randomly chooses one of the

300
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,839
one of the things let me show you oops

301
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,600
well uh okay

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
yeah so round between

303
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,040
randomly choose one of the cells and it

304
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
works that's how that's how we get the

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,200
simplest forms of dynamic content now uh

306
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
let's look at the actual signatures

307
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
right what happens with that once again

308
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
since we're signing bits it doesn't

309
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
really matter but

310
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,040
if we open it up it looks quite

311
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,719
spectacular so here we have the

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
pre-signed document i signed it

313
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
with dynamic content

314
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
and this is the most popular standalone

315
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
app that we use

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
back in latvia i have signed here if i

317
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
press validate

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
it's fully valid right and if i try to

319
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
extract the docx file it's the same docx

320
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
file uh just for the billability i'm

321
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
gonna

322
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,040
do that right now of course for you

323
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,839
so we have an empty folder here

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
gonna not gonna work that way

325
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,320
i'm gonna export it

326
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
into this folder here

327
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
okay

328
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
and there it is and once again this is

329
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
the same file right it says peter owes

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,639
some money to john and if you open it

331
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,399
once again it will say john owes some

332
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
money to peter right

333
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,839
the other thing was the static preview

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,440
uh with the static preview we opted to

335
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
create a demo that will actually allow

336
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
us to um differentiate the kind of app

337
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,360
in a way that's being used without it

338
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
connecting to the internet analyzing

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
servers and this second file here if you

340
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,040
implement here with the official tool

341
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
once again uh what we're gonna see is uh

342
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
we're on screen again

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
what we're gonna see is it has preview

344
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,959
function and if you open it up it

345
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
actually says right there can't see that

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
it actually says right there

347
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
in bold on second line this document is

348
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
opened with this specific program and

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
we're going to say that always every

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
time you open it

351
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,839
but if we

352
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,600
extract it

353
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
we will see that it's opened in normal

354
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
way and this is because of the preview

355
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,680
function that is crapped previously

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,480
right so this is the preview once again

357
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,360
and if we export it

358
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
and this is the other file and we open

359
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
it normally it says its document is

360
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
opened normally right

361
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
so

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,519
that's that's the problem right but

363
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,680
technically it's not that interesting i

364
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,800
mean

365
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,399
it was super easy to

366
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
think of the exploit it was

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
quite easy to create the files

368
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
um and it's

369
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
it's not like it's a vulnerability at

370
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,600
least the government doesn't think it is

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,920
now of course this also works for other

372
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,480
signature schemes like for example a gpg

373
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
or libreoffice built-in

374
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
signatures

375
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,120
now the question is

376
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
does it really matter

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
is is it really a problem and this is

378
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,079
the management uh the presentation the

379
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,440
part of my presentation where management

380
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
people will feel home so

381
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
for for management people what i've

382
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
learned over the years is it's it's not

383
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
always the technical reality is it there

384
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
or is it there

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
but the mic is not not working too well

386
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,560
is it there or is it not there

387
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
the rather what's important is

388
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,480
what happens if we exploit it can it be

389
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
exploited and can we accept the risk

390
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,279
now

391
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
does this really matter here well

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
the tampers that i demonstrated are

393
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
apparent

394
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,440
so

395
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
it stands to argue

396
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
that if me and you signed an agreement

397
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
like that

398
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,720
and then i tried to screw you over you

399
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
could go to court and an expert

400
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
in court could tell this document was

401
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,199
tampered in this way

402
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
it's not valid even though we signed it

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,600
and problem solved right because we do

404
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
have fraud prosecution and that's how

405
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
that's what the government is betting on

406
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
right now

407
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
so they will not fix it

408
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,760
i

409
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
tried talking to

410
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
different people i i contacted local

411
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
latvian cert we got the government

412
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,800
involved the department's responsible

413
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
for digital signature safety

414
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,120
we even got european partners involved

415
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,199
most of the european partners didn't

416
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,480
want anything to do with it they

417
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
wouldn't touch it with a stick that's

418
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,199
like let's not talk about that it's not

419
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
a problem right see previous slide

420
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
court will figure it out

421
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,360
so we talked and talked and talked

422
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,199
and it didn't work

423
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
no one no one cared

424
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
in latvia we did do a coordinated

425
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,839
release of information to general public

426
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,800
to developers about this risk

427
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
but it didn't really take off so because

428
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,839
it's

429
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,399
not a problem right

430
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,920
but now what if we could make a document

431
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
dynamic but at the same time if someone

432
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,839
were to look at it

433
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,800
in a court of law they could not

434
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,279
necessarily prove that it's been

435
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
prepared specifically that way

436
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
now what i'm thinking here

437
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,759
of course is remote content

438
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
and

439
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
emails

440
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
we do use email i have remote images

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,199
turned off

442
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,600
99 of email users don't

443
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,199
html we have remote images loading

444
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,480
hardware sites

445
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,959
so it's not inconceivable

446
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
to convince the court

447
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
that that's how your

448
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
document department created the document

449
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
we just have this remote image there it

450
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,959
doesn't mean it's fraud right we use

451
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
that for emails it makes sense so

452
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
there is this potential problem

453
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,959
who is that

454
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,560
the other part

455
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,360
is because this problem cannot be solved

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
technologically and it cannot be solved

457
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,680
politically one party cannot solve it we

458
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
are thinking about

459
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,759
always when we find a vulnerability or

460
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
when we just write an exploit for an old

461
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,280
vulnerability like in this research here

462
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
we try to think okay we need to propose

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,640
a solution

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,599
but we couldn't find any technological

465
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
solution and politically they can't do

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
anything about it neither so we need to

467
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,679
work together

468
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,799
to

469
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
be able to fix this one proposal the

470
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
main proposal that we had the one i

471
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
personally like the best

472
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,880
is okay if european union wants to allow

473
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
the citizens to sign mp3 files or dot

474
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
exe files or malware samples it's okay

475
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
we can we can leave that but we need to

476
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
create a new scheme

477
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
specifically for signing documents

478
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
because what people sign is what they

479
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
have in front of them

480
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
we shouldn't be signing bits

481
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
we should be signing

482
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
what we see on the screen and that is

483
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
why we cannot fix it just by one party

484
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
working right if we just change the

485
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,840
technological part then eu and some

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
people are mad that they cannot sign

487
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,679
mp3s if we just change the political

488
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,039
part the technical vulnerability is

489
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,320
still there

490
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
so that's

491
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,960
the main uh problem there and that is my

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
proposal how

493
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,559
how to deal with

494
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
that thing over there

495
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,880
and i'm ready for q a here

496
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
if

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
anyone has anything to suggest i would

498
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
for for i know that

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
at the conference we usually don't

500
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
appreciate uh comments instead of

501
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
questions but

502
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,400
since

503
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
the the uh tent here is only about one

504
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,760
half full um i would love to hear from

505
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
you if you've been working with digital

506
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,720
signatures or if you've been working on

507
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,760
that before

508
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
uh that'd be that'd be really great

509
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
because i have

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,160
i mean i tried we we published this

511
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
exactly a year ago last last july and

512
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,360
not fixed thank you

513
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
thank you carols um just a second thanks

514
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,679
for queuing up do we have any questions

515
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
from the internet

516
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
no questions from the internet so please

517
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
mike the front mic please

518
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,880
have you

519
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
found any ways to explore this with pdf

520
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
and pdfa specifically

521
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
the newest pdf formats also have dynamic

522
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
content in them yes

523
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
our our workaround solution that we

524
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
propose to our

525
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
partners and customers

526
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,799
is that we use pdf version one

527
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
with a only static jpeg in it

528
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
so that's that's how that's how we do it

529
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
right now but modern pdfs can have

530
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
dynamic content as well yes

531
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,280
do you know if pdf a already is the

532
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
restricted format that you would need

533
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,440
that is

534
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
that is the safe format i believe we

535
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
didn't find

536
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
anything in

537
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,280
there the back mike please uh please

538
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
talk very closely to the microphone

539
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,799
thank you

540
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,840
yeah it's it's not a questions only a

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,960
comment

542
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,320
you

543
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,120
mentioned about politicians and

544
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,720
such

545
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
documents which are digitally signed but

546
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
in reality nobody knows

547
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
what is a digital signed document nobody

548
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
use it

549
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,039
for example a couple of

550
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,679
politicians in austria germany and spain

551
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,799
answered to an email coming from ukraine

552
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,960
it was vladimir klitschko and it was

553
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
only a video screen and nobody knows or

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
only some detected that's not a question

555
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,799
it's only a command thank you so much

556
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,400
for the comment yes maybe i am ahead of

557
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
ahead of my time here maybe i'm talking

558
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
about the problem um

559
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
which is a bit more complex than the

560
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,440
actual problems that the users are

561
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
facing and

562
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,480
i'm going to open up the signature

563
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
application again

564
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
actually

565
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
in

566
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,320
for the customers some of the trainings

567
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,400
we do we include

568
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
a slide on how to verify e-signature

569
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
using the official app and it's still a

570
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
problem so if i open one of the it

571
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
doesn't matter if it's dynamic if it's

572
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,039
tempered or not if i open one of the

573
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,960
documents

574
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,480
what we do is we open it up and we show

575
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
it to them and we ask them okay so

576
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,440
this is

577
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
this is a screen

578
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
is this document

579
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
valid is a signature on it valid

580
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
most of you probably have never used the

581
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
app what do you think is the signature

582
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
valid how many of you think this is a

583
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
valid signature that that will

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
you don't trust me do you how many of

585
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,158
you think it's an invalid signature

586
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,919
okay some more people how many of you

587
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
don't know

588
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
oh good you're really smart so the thing

589
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,600
is

590
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
this is the official tool it's the

591
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,320
newest version of the official tool

592
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
we've had it for

593
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
10 years i think and you open up the

594
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
document it will not say if it's valid

595
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,480
or not you have to press the validate

596
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
button

597
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
and only then

598
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
the blue thingy on on the left bottom

599
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,919
changes into green thinking

600
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
um that's how the app works they never

601
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,039
that they aren't updating i don't know

602
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,320
why

603
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
so yes thank you for the comment um and

604
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
we do have lots of lots of these uh

605
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,400
these problems with these signatures

606
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
and the real question i guess is how do

607
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,360
we make it

608
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
so that it's easy to use but at the same

609
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
time that people can can trust it right

610
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
because it's easy to make a phone app

611
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,559
that just displays a green check mark

612
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,600
and we have a bunch of those in

613
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
different fields

614
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
but

615
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,039
what if i make a similar phone app that

616
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
displays the same check mark so trying

617
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,240
to

618
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,640
communicate the

619
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
bits

620
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
in the computer memory to a human user

621
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,039
which is not i.t savvy is is always

622
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,000
going to be in challenge i believe

623
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
all right um do we have any more

624
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
questions from the internet

625
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,919
no no no questions from dinner but

626
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
someone lined up to the microphone in

627
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,120
the front thank you yeah um question

628
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
could you actually replace a document

629
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,679
which is signed so if i got a signed

630
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,440
document could you replace a document

631
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,840
behind it

632
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,400
thank you for the question so

633
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
the attack i'm talking about here talks

634
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
about prepared documents two kinds of

635
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
those those were a court in my opinion

636
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,840
could tell that has been specifically

637
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
maliciously prepared and those where

638
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,960
court couldn't

639
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
conclude that conclusively

640
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,159
there is attack in 2017 by google called

641
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
shattered but even there

642
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,080
for

643
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
a limited amount of computing resources

644
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
you would need to maliciously prepare

645
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,720
the document

646
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
for it to be completely replaced and and

647
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,039
they work with hashtags over there

648
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,880
meaning that we have two completely

649
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,279
different pages which have the same

650
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
cache now for vulnerable hashtags it is

651
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,039
also possible of course to replace it

652
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
post factum right if the cache is broken

653
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,720
and we can generate uh for a known input

654
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
uh for non output hash we can generate

655
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
arbitrary input we can of course replace

656
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
it with anything

657
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,159
all the time right so in that sense

658
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,400
these documents let's say

659
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
i'm just guessing in 50 years in in 100

660
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
years

661
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,400
they will be worthless because

662
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
people will be able to use these old

663
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,919
hash algorithms and generate collisions

664
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,559
i believe

665
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,000
and uh one more uh so you say we want to

666
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
sign what we see actually so would you

667
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
say that assigned bitmap is um okay that

668
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
this should be valid

669
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
yes that that that's exactly that's the

670
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
direction we're going in right if we

671
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
were if we had the

672
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,720
political tools i if i can call it that

673
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,919
way uh to create a new new format and it

674
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,679
is political question right

675
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,360
then we would probably go for a bitmap

676
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
that's that's the easiest right there

677
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,919
are some strange things in there as well

678
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,960
um

679
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
i don't believe you can have

680
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
transparency in bitmap right but there

681
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,880
are different bitmap formats that you

682
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,559
can use um

683
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
yes

684
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
yes please mike one if you want to

685
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
reduce the whole problem to just having

686
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,799
static images to show that you sign you

687
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,640
still have the problem that you need to

688
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
trust the program that displays the

689
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
image and the hardware that the image

690
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,400
gets displayed on so all of that

691
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
i mean it's reduced so only experts can

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
really work with sign data because they

693
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,039
have to understand the whole system

694
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,720
and you can't really trust

695
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,480
just consumers to understand the

696
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,559
subtleties of a system i think that's

697
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,480
the core of the problem right so it

698
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
makes you think if with electronic

699
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
signatures we kind of skipped

700
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
uh the part that we are now debating for

701
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,360
electronic voting for internet voting

702
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
right everyone except estonia thinks

703
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
that internet voting at the moment

704
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
thinks that internet voting is not the

705
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
brightest of ideas

706
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,039
and we aren't using it now for east

707
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,120
signatures what what the audience what

708
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
you are telling me today

709
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
i feel like maybe we just

710
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,080
slept and didn't notice that that's

711
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,679
happening because all all that is true

712
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,840
of course

713
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
right one more one once more to the

714
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,960
signal angel no questions from the

715
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,799
internet unfortunately

716
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
okay that's fine

717
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,159
and any other questions from the

718
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,400
audience we still got a few minutes left

719
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
so feel free to bother him with

720
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
anything

721
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,640
so it's broken but how do we fix it

722
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
that's the question right because i'm

723
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
going to repeat to repeat once again

724
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,159
what i said in the presentation it is um

725
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,159
not that big of a problem in in in the

726
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
eyes of the management and at the same

727
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,799
time

728
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,120
it is kind of hard to fix

729
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,159
front mic

730
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,200
yes so

731
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,279
uh if you just allow static content on

732
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,520
besides so let's say it's just text

733
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,240
and make sure you use a secure algorithm

734
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
because if the algorithm is broken

735
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
everything's broken

736
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
wouldn't that solve the problem and of

737
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
course make sure the chain of trust is

738
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
complete so

739
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,159
save cpu save hardware save everything

740
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,279
yeah that would solve the problem

741
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
outlined in the presentation right but

742
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
people want to and and they actually

743
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,919
need images or representations when

744
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,279
signing some contracts you can't just

745
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,080
have uh basic text right and if you have

746
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,000
just static images that cannot change do

747
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,799
not allow dynamic content yeah yeah from

748
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,080
technical perspectives that's great the

749
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,919
problem is right eu

750
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
is a slow beast yeah thanks

751
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,840
any evidence of a real world tempering

752
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,399
has been found or

753
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,200
um

754
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,080
yes

755
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
i'm not sure if i can say more than that

756
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,559
but we we got as a feedback from the

757
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,640
people we contacted we got info that

758
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
there have been a limited amount of

759
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
of tampering i think i can name the

760
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,559
numbers so for a country of

761
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
approximately two million people um i

762
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
believe it's it's about two cases per

763
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,279
five years

764
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,679
and did it get solved in court

765
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,559
uh

766
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
police solve it

767
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,279
so yes fraud protection uh final thing

768
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,320
i'd like to

769
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
add please if you if you have any

770
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
contact in the government or or

771
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,159
the formal non-hacker world talk to them

772
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,399
about about this we need more allies

773
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,760
outside the flat fee and maybe we can

774
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,159
fix it together thanks

775
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,919
all right and with that thanks very much

776
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,930
careless

777
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:20,199
[Applause]

778
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,360
you
