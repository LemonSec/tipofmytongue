00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:16,880
[Music]

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
so here this evening to talk to us about

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
smartos uh sorry illamas smartos uh

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
which is a specialized hypervisor uh

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
distribution uh is thomas so thanks a

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,950
lot give him a hand so

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,310
[Music]

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,640
[Applause]

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
[Laughter]

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
yeah let's talk a little bit about

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
illumos so

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,760
it's more or less a specialized

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
hypervisor as already said

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
but let's see a bit about the agenda so

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
i will share a bit about myself and

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
share a bit about um how all that indium

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
stuff happened and what are the

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
difference to linux and bsd

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
um what makes smarter as itself really

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
special besides other operating systems

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,479
and share a bit how to use it

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
and based on that i hope i prepared a

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
bit of demo so we can log into in term

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,040
servers and

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
random commands

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,439
and beside that at the end i share a bit

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,439
about the community itself how it's

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,439
organized and how you get additional

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,920
information about it and then you're for

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
sure you can ask

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,159
a lot of questions

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
so about it myself so i'm thomas i more

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
or less work as a server ninja for

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
skyline

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
we provide smart ass based hosting and

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
cloud solutions with our current brand

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
and i doing unix and cleaners

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
consultancy for around well i would say

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,960
15 years or maybe a bit longer

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
and i more or less focus on system

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
administration and automation and

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
so-called the cloud

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
and

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
maybe interesting for people who well

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,079
think a bit about solaris um i not

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
started with a large background

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
so i came from linux to

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
smart os

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,119
so then we already started with what

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
what is illumis itself

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
what are the difference a bit to linux

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
and psd

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,520
it might be really hard to read

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
but

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
the most important part is

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
that

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
illumis itself came from operas

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
so we

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
at a point

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
for um yes sun microsystems

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
created solaris and then they open

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,160
sourced it

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
was which was quite great for for lots

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
of people and for the community and i

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,640
think for sun itself as well but then

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
sun got acquired by oracle

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319
and um oracle closed sourced it again so

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
and at that point in time illumis get

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
forked based on the sun code

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
and the open solaris code and continued

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
with with the code improved it and did a

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
lot of stuff as well

73
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
it's still different to

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
oracle solaris but

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,519
some parts may stay the same

76
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,319
so

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
you can say more or less

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
oracle solaris 10

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,879
is more or less equivalent to illumos

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,879
with different feature sets

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
well

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
so what itself is a smarter s smartest

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,799
is the loom space distributions there

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
are a couple of more distributions out

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
there but for for today we will focus on

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
smartest because

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
i like it really much

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,159
so

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,879
it's originally developed by giant um

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,440
they are also well oh there we are a

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
cloud hosting company

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
they got acquired a couple of years ago

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
by samsung because they would like to

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,440
use their

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,239
technology especially smartest and

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
f3 stored object storage

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
for for their selves more to say

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,519
and

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,080
i think it's now two months ago or maybe

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
three when

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
[Music]

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
smartest as a brand

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,599
and

104
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519
including them data center features are

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
stu minix

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
which is also a cloud hosting provider

107
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,360
based in the us

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
smartest itself provides some solaris

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
features for example

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,360
zones alex branded zones crossbow open

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
zfs and dtrace

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
later on i will go more a bit into the

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
details

114
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
it's models itself focus

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,800
a lot about virtualization so you boot

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
from an usb stick or netboot

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
and can use your complete

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,919
disks

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,680
um for

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
storing the virtual machines

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,360
the configuration itself is really

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
minimalistic and

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
it also provides some kind of management

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
tools to manage these virtual machines

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,919
or zones

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
it supports

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
additional to its zones itself it

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
supports beehive and kvm

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
so you can run more or less every

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
operating system on top of smarters

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
so

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
two zones

133
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
zones provides os virtualization layer

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
um it's more or less a self-managed

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
container for example like docker but i

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
would say a bit better but that depends

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
um

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
it provides some kind of isolation so

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
zone

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
only the zone only see itself

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
the global zone so more or less the

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
smartest

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
hypervisor thing can monitor the local

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,960
zone

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
it provides

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
an own network and

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
isolated file system

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,360
the resources can be controlled so

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
memory disk network io and cpu cores you

150
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,479
can also

151
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
configure them firewall settings in the

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,319
global zone

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
or for the user can configure that

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
itself in his own zone

155
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,759
the zone

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
provides a minimal overhead because it's

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
more or less running bare metal on

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
on your hardware so no hardware

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
emulation layer is in between

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
and

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
yeah you can use

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
services

163
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,960
to monitor

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
monitor your zone from the global zone

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
itself for example you can run dtrace

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,080
script in the global zone to manage all

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
or well to monitor all your customer

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
zones

169
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
and services inside that

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,479
there's some

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
really nice

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,319
branded zone out there it's called the

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,919
linux branded zone

174
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
it provides this linux system called

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
translation layer so you can

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
run linux binaries on top of smart os

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
these systems get been translated to the

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
lumos kernel itself

179
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,520
it feels and looks like a normal zone so

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
you can use the same tools

181
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,039
to manage

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
both zone types

183
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,639
and

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,520
they are already pre-installed

185
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
yeah images so to say

186
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
available for example for debian center

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,319
s void linux and so on

188
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
and it's also possible to run docker on

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,280
top of smartest based on these linux

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,679
branded zones

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,759
there is also crossbow it um

192
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
it could also be seen as a virtual mix

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
management tool and

194
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
driver so

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
you can create and manage virtual

196
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,160
network interfaces and switches for your

197
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,120
zone

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
interconnect

199
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
the zones itself um yeah

200
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,879
use some kind of anti-spoofing

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
tools to

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
run them mac filtering or ip filtering

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
or especially dcp package filtering so a

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
zone

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
will only be able to run dhcp and

206
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
receive an ip address or can only use a

207
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
specified ip address which you have

208
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
configured you can also use them kind of

209
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
bandwidth tools to limit a bandwidth or

210
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
provide

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
some kind of tooling around of that

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,879
luckily base hits

213
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
on open solaris and

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
we have set fs

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
so a copy on write file system with pool

216
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,880
storage partitions are not required and

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
you have a welder management layer which

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
maybe lots of people already know um on

219
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
from freebsd or now also from linux

220
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
you

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
you based on that you are able to yeah

222
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,680
run set quotas easily for the zone

223
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,800
and

224
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
you have

225
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
for sure different rate sets so from

226
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
rate one some kind of mirroring to rate

227
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
that and the rates at two and so on or

228
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
rate zero for striping

229
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
i will not go into much of detail of zfs

230
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
um i think it could be a complete other

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
talk

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
but some additional small features which

233
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
i think is

234
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,399
might be interesting so it provides some

235
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,880
kind of compression deduplication

236
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,760
and snapshot cloning support and also

237
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
now for sure encryption

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,959
so you can yeah if you have a zone you

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
can run a snapshot based on that

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
do them changes and if it doesn't work

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
you will roll back the complete

242
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
operation well the complete content of

243
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
the zone for your customer

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
because we have beehive and kvm support

245
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
beehive support has been ported i think

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
it's now one year ago or so

247
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
which provides much more performance

248
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
instead of kvm

249
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
you will be able to run um yeah lots of

250
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
other operating system on top of smart

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,040
os

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,760
so

253
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
linux bsd windows plan 9 is also working

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
and

255
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
the really cool stuff is you can use the

256
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
same tools um

257
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,519
for

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,320
zones and also for beehive branded zones

259
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
for elixir renaissance they are all the

260
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
same

261
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,079
and well look and feel is also the same

262
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,479
based on that

263
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,839
so how to use it

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,640
you

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
easily download

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
the usb image for example

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,640
boot your server up with a usb stick

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,800
follow the installer which will run them

269
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,680
pre-configurations and ask you some

270
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
questions about network um how you would

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
like to configure setpool

272
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
and um yeah hostname and password are

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
also required

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,959
and

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,079
after that you also boot um smartest

276
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
based on that usb stick

277
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
um but you will also be able to well

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,880
since now two years that's already you

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,839
can run

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
pi rdm to install it permanently on your

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
disks

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
but i i personally prefer to well use

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,959
the usb stick or use netboot to boot

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,200
put all the machines which can easily be

285
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
then updated

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
and the complete disk pool can be used

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
for virtualization or for the virtual

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
stuff

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
um a short note about the global zone

290
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
itself which is the zone you well is the

291
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,279
first zone you boot or basically the

292
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
operating system it's a minimal ram disk

293
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
which um yeah well copied from the usb

294
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,279
stick into the memory um it's yeah only

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
for zone management so you do not have

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
much tooling around

297
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
beside the zoom management so to install

298
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,920
something could be a bit harder

299
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,320
because um well etc and root and other

300
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
stuff is not permanent user couldn't be

301
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
written

302
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
because it's in the memory and it's read

303
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,519
mount reid read only mounted the only

304
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,720
parts where you can write data is in opt

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
and var for permanent storage and for

306
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
sure you have a sound pool which you can

307
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
use for virtualization of all the

308
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
zones itself the basic configuration is

309
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,399
started on the slash usb stick which is

310
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,560
not the usb stick itself

311
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
so which is in the zone pool which is a

312
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
bit confusing and

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
well in that basic configuration it's a

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,519
basic configuration text file

315
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
which you can configure more or less the

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
stuff you have configured already in the

317
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,920
installer

318
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
then there are all kinds of data sets

319
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
around there and then we can also see

320
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
that as images

321
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
they are pre-configured zones alex

322
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,440
friend zones beehive or kvm images

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,639
they

324
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
will probably provide you with already

325
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
some running services or with a complete

326
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
operating system what you already need

327
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
there are well official images from

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
smart as itself they are more or less

329
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,800
pro well

330
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
provided by now from mnx before that

331
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
they are provided from joint

332
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,279
they can be reached from images.smart

333
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,880
but there are also community based

334
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,040
images which are shared with via dataset

335
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
80

336
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
so for example as a list

337
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,800
you already see

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,519
well an ubuntu image for example or

339
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,160
netbsd image

340
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
which you more or less see that

341
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
it contains alex so it's a line of

342
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,680
sprint zone

343
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,120
a set wall

344
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,920
says

345
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,399
it will be could be used for kvm and

346
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,600
beehive

347
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
and well there's the zone data set which

348
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,519
is a real running zone

349
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
and you also see for example based on

350
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,360
the naming

351
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,199
there are the base zones around there

352
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,079
them there are some mx zone which

353
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
provides um x those mail services

354
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
and there are also lots of more based on

355
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
the community

356
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
as to to create a zone first you need to

357
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
import that image

358
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
all images are well

359
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
more or less named by a new uid which

360
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,279
are addressed by uuid they also contains

361
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,240
names but that's mostly how you fetch it

362
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
so you run emg rdm import and the uuid

363
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
and you get

364
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
the image

365
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
which then locally be stored on your

366
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,439
server

367
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
then for the zone creation itself

368
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
you um well

369
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
use a json configuration files um

370
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,920
which provides already a of information

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,519
which are required

372
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
for the zone there are a couple of more

373
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,519
this is only a short

374
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,240
i would cut based on the minimal needs

375
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
so for example how the zone will

376
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
be aliased how the hostname is

377
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
configured

378
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,040
how the network of the zone is

379
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
configured and

380
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
which and how much memory it will use

381
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,079
and which type of

382
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,839
zone it is um

383
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
because it's developed by joint the

384
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
giant

385
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,279
zone is the original zone so no not the

386
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
elex printer zone

387
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
and then you run

388
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
vm idm create and the json configuration

389
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
file and this will probably create this

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
zone for you

391
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,000
and then it will be reachable hopefully

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
and uh yeah and then you can also

393
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
yeah as you can see you can list the

394
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
zones as well

395
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
for for example yeah you run a vm adm

396
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
list and then you see the current

397
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
running zones or probably all zones

398
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
which are existing on the server

399
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
vm adm provides a lots of more com well

400
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,920
sub commands and filtering options for

401
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,759
the list command to only see the running

402
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
zone to only see zones which will have a

403
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,120
memory of 200

404
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
or which aliases are

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
starting with whatever letter and or

406
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
what which type it will be or which ip

407
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
address it will have

408
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,120
as already said there are lots of sub

409
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
commands for example one of the

410
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
important is vm idm

411
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,040
and you get all the details of the zone

412
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,360
so if it have an autostart which brand

413
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
it is which well version type

414
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,839
which memory which quota and so on

415
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,399
there are some kind of a bit special

416
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
stuff um especially for bee hive and kvm

417
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,399
because um bee hive and kvm supports vt

418
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
information

419
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
to connect well to a via vnc server a vr

420
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,240
cbse client to that server and it um

421
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,639
provide the details of the host name

422
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,720
the port and the display and if

423
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,519
configured also a password for that vnc

424
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,519
session

425
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,559
then you can easily log in with well

426
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
with set login you easily can log in

427
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,520
into existing zones and then you receive

428
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
a shell there or if you have configured

429
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,959
ssh you probably can also use that but

430
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,280
that provided quite easy management

431
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,039
functionality

432
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
and you can also use that login which

433
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
then be a bit rapid

434
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,359
to

435
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,559
beehive zones as well

436
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
because they are already um well we

437
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,000
talked a lot about commands itself

438
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
there are also

439
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
some kind of uh yeah

440
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
web uis or orchestration software on top

441
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
of smart s

442
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
so the origin one um firstly developed

443
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,480
by joined is this mother strident data

444
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,600
center

445
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,039
which provides well all the data center

446
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
functionality you need

447
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,360
from from kind of master server to

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,440
manage the um

449
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,080
your zones or your virtual machines

450
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
with an api and so on

451
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
but they're also well

452
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,799
now two

453
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,520
kinds of community projects um for

454
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
example there's project fifo

455
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
which is well

456
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
well starting with the top one smartest

457
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
strident data centers more or less

458
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,640
written in node.js project five was

459
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,400
written in erlang and for danube cloud

460
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
i'm pretty not sure what it is

461
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
it's a kind of also i think based on

462
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
brighton data center but i'm really not

463
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,799
sure

464
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,520
but yeah all of them provides well

465
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
different kind of web interfaces to

466
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,280
manage these zones or provide a bigger

467
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
cluster

468
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
on top of that well basically a data

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,880
center

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,799
well then um yeah i more or less prevent

471
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,400
i hopefully

472
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
you might hopefully see it

473
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
maybe a bit um i've had a kind of demo

474
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,919
or

475
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
well would like to show you a bit around

476
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
so

477
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
um yeah i currently have installed

478
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
smartdress

479
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
um there are below use while i running

480
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
in

481
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
in my local environment so you're more

482
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,480
or less running a scene console

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
um yeah but there are we have a shell

484
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,559
which all this hopefully can be good

485
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,120
read and i have well written down

486
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
types which i would like to show you

487
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
around um as i said you you more or less

488
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,640
have

489
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,679
vm

490
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,280
adm to list the zones itself

491
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
to get everything

492
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
um

493
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,240
yeah you have emg idm avail for example

494
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,880
to see the value available

495
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
um yeah zones

496
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,799
maybe

497
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,280
yeah the network is working so um yeah

498
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
for example there are some kind of

499
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,520
pre-configured zones you have them basic

500
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,880
zones

501
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,360
um yeah based on the naming they provide

502
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
um different tooling inside

503
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,640
everything on smart os itself or

504
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
especially the smartest branded zones

505
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,919
are managed

506
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
provide software packages via patch

507
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,080
source

508
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
and yeah and there are also some kind of

509
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
lts images which more or less provides

510
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,559
longer support of package source

511
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,320
packages there

512
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
so you do not need to to update it

513
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
itself

514
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
so if you're going back to vmadm um we

515
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,640
currently as you have seen we have two

516
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
os branded zones which which are um

517
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
well native zones and we have one lx

518
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,919
branded zone

519
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
like as as i said on my local setup i

520
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
will not run any beehive because it's

521
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
required a bit of more ram

522
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
so if you for example log in

523
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
into uh well lx brand its own

524
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
so while doing a bit of

525
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
file user pin file for example

526
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
and um you you more or less see

527
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
that's a really linux command

528
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
which exists there and can be easily

529
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
used

530
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
on top of that

531
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
and

532
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,400
one

533
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,559
might be some interesting stuff there's

534
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,120
a slash native which provides native

535
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
commands

536
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
from outside this zone

537
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,200
so for example if i run a setfs list

538
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
well currently no data set is available

539
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
inside that

540
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,520
but that's a native command which is

541
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
based on from the outside

542
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
smartest global zone

543
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
so if we log out we can also easily

544
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,678
update

545
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,960
some kind of quota if we for example

546
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
need more

547
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,039
or make it smaller

548
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,039
and it's update

549
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,760
live so for example if you're going for

550
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,158
net

551
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
eat more let's see that's going to be 5

552
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,678
and if you're going into 10

553
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
we also got that

554
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,880
and i currently need to

555
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,400
see

556
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
which time we currently have so we might

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,360
have a bit of time left

558
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
so

559
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,280
if we log in here again

560
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,080
i can also show you

561
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
how the json's files looks like

562
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
so maybe interesting for for the elix

563
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,320
sprint so itself if it can be yeah um we

564
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,480
need to provide a kernel version this

565
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
kernel version is more or less um

566
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,600
for illumise and of course madras itself

567
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,559
to know

568
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
how which type of syscall translation

569
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
layers should be used so if something

570
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,559
changed into the line in the linux

571
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,120
kernel and it doesn't match 100

572
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
you can also choose a different kernel

573
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,880
version depends a bit on your needs

574
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,679
also with dtrace you will be able to um

575
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,880
yeah check the syscalls in in linux

576
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
brand its own

577
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,919
if

578
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,640
the

579
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
scroll works or not and if it's

580
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
implemented in smartwares and

581
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,640
really working or not

582
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,799
most of this is called well for regular

583
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,880
commands and for regular programs i

584
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,559
guess it's working so for for example i

585
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,520
an

586
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
open air a

587
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,919
so read a lot server in

588
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,559
top of void linux because it's

589
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
a hell to get mono working on smartwatch

590
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,919
at the moment

591
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
and as you currently see um yeah mostly

592
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,720
we have some network configuration there

593
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
nothing more is provided

594
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
if we go into another example you can

595
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,840
provide them

596
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
more details um which is called metadata

597
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
which are auto well which you can read

598
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
out in indict the zone and well run

599
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
on top of that num commands or well

600
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
pre-configure these zone

601
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
and you can also use user script which

602
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
is a well probably a shell script or

603
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,480
whatever type of script which you can

604
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
put in here and it will be executed

605
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
automatically

606
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,320
on the start

607
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,639
zone

608
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,120
yeah probably that's mostly all a bit

609
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,799
about the community itself um yeah we

610
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,039
have illumise.org which provides well

611
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,440
basic illuminous information also some

612
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,840
kind of information to the other

613
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
distributions out there and which

614
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,919
smallest feature they provide

615
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,440
for smartest

616
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,240
i can really recommend the wiki page

617
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
which provides mostly all information

618
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
about smartest and how to use it

619
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
and additional commands itself

620
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
on github you will find

621
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,640
the code currently moved from join to

622
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
triton data center as a naming

623
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,799
and um yeah force modus itself it's

624
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,080
modest life

625
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
there is also um illumos madras which is

626
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,159
a well

627
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,720
a fork of the illumous code to provide

628
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
maybe additional features or upstream

629
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
that

630
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,600
the community itself is more or less

631
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
organized um

632
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
well on irc and i think they also

633
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
provide a matrix

634
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,000
bridge somehow but i'm i'm really not

635
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
family with it

636
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
um yeah and it's also

637
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,520
good organized in

638
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,320
well

639
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,039
in different lists and mailing lists

640
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,159
which which also helps a lot

641
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
yeah that's probably all from my site

642
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,559
so if you have any questions

643
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
awesome thanks so much um we've got

644
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
plenty of time so any questions please

645
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,919
take it away

646
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,200
yeah um

647
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,880
when you were doing the demo you were

648
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
always or also in the slides you were

649
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
always using the full id of the zone

650
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
which was pretty long

651
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,080
and

652
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,240
i'm sure when the system is small scale

653
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,159
it's easy to oversee okay that's zone

654
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
one two and three but can you also use

655
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
the alias uh to use the zone admin

656
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
commands or are they not unique yes yes

657
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
you can also use the alias and use a

658
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
multup and then it will translate the

659
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
alias into the well uuid

660
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
and then the uids well used for their

661
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
dressing itself then

662
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
okay so you end up with the id but you

663
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
can use the api to translate exactly

664
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,880
yeah okay thanks

665
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
okay it says no more questions uh then

666
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,080
that's it for us this evening so uh

667
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,450
thank you once again thanks as well

668
00:26:52,450 --> 00:27:00,349
[Applause]
