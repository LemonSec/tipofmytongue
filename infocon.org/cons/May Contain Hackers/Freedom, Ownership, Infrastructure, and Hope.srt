[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,119
if you're a regular conference attendee

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
you know these talks where they provide

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,119
you with the speakers provide you with

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,039
answers with how to's with

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
solutions to certain problems um at hack

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,519
events like mch there are also these

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
talks where they don't prov where the

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
speakers don't provide you with with

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,680
answers but they just post interesting

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
questions

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,320
next talk is one of those talks um

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
so

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
the next speakers is is going to provide

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
us with questions and directions on how

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
we could encode uh

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
and what social model in the

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,559
infrastructure we build so please

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,879
welcome with a very warm round of

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,399
applause

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,800
eleanor and freedom ownership

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
infrastructure and hope

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,400
[Applause]

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
hi there

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
so this this will be as noted a slightly

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,760
different talk hopefully there will be

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,200
some interesting questions that you get

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
coming out of it um there are no slides

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
instead you can just view some beautiful

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
well you probably can't see it because

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
daylight but overview effect um in the

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,479
background so

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
first kind of a historical note of how i

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
came to be here giving this talk i'm a

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
kid who grew up with bucky fuller and

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
climate modeling and a bunch of other

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,200
stuff

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
and i spent a while thinking about

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
governance and

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
um well i guess

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
detour via commercial security world did

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
a bunch of early threat modeling work

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,920
that kind of thing and i spent a while

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
thinking about governance and how do we

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,079
build governments how do they actually

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,360
get structured

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
um

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
you know i did a a bunch of that

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,200
thinking was happening in the context of

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
the arab spring and occupy

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,960
i spent some time with smari trying to

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
rebuild the icelandic constitution into

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,079
something more useful

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,960
um

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,479
and i spent a bunch of time in the ngo

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,680
world

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
and you know doing security for

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
activists and news organizations who are

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
being targeted by nation states and

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,959
eventually i get really burnt out and

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,160
quit and went back to the commercial

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
world because i was tired of not being

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,040
able to solve the problem

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
you know it's it's one thing doing the

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,239
kind of work where you know that your

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,319
best case is that you reduce the

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,640
likelihood that the people that you're

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
trying to take care of die where it's a

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
statistical reduction and that's your

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
best outcome but we weren't even really

71
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
getting that you know we were not doing

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
the work suitable to solve the problem

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
and i've sort of come to think of of

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
ngos as the bards of the 21st century's

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,760
form of epic tragic poetry you know they

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
write all of these white papers and you

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
know charts and graphs and presentations

78
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
and that kind of stuff that chronicle

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
the ongoing decline of human

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,160
civilization which is a nice job i guess

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
you know i think they could probably do

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
a bit better with actual poetry but

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
that's basically what they're doing um

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
and so let's talk a bit about our

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
current moment so

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,480
as you may have noticed we're dealing

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,319
with a massive resurgence of fascism

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
across europe and across america and

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
really seemingly across

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,040
most places uh the u.s is preparing for

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
its first large-scale queer genocide

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
which is probably going to start in a

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
couple of years um

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
we are dealing with an explosion of

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,239
oligarchs right we have added

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,560
an amazing number of billionaires over

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
the course of this first half of this

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
pandemic

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,280
which is

100
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
not actually great for a lot of reasons

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
that we'll talk about

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
and if we want to

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
maintain globally organized human

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
civilization we have about seven and a

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
half years to get to carbon zero

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
now most people say net zero but

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
it's kind of questionable these days

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,239
because it turns out that most of the

109
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,840
offsets are junk

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
and that carbon capture and storage is

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
never going to be viable at scale

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
because it requires wildly too much

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,879
energy

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
and we can't build reactors fast enough

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,519
right you start a new reactor project

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,640
right now even if you waive the

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
permitting process and you're just

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
looking at construction it's going to

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,519
take 20 years

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,040
so nuclear is

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
irrelevant

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
regardless of what you think about it

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,199
otherwise

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,079
um

125
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
and there's a bunch of other stuff that

126
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,120
we've kind of figured out like

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
we finally have an estimate of how much

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
methane gets leaked globally and it

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,080
turns out that once you account you know

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
uh once you account methane leakage

131
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
liquid natural gas is worse than coal

132
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
we're literally better off spinning up

133
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
all the coal-fired power plants because

134
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,600
that doesn't leak into the upper

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
atmosphere

136
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
um so there's a lot of stuff where our

137
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
we keep realizing that our situation is

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
is worse than it previously was

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
and uh

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
and this is you know and a lot of this

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,479
is also driving a lot of the rising

142
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
fascism out of this kind of stuff we

143
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,000
live in an uncertain world and in an

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
uncertain world people look to strong

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
leaders who are willing to shoot the

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
other

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
which is great when you're the other

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
so

149
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
if you look at

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
the

151
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
um

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
there are three estimates in the recent

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
ipcc report which are in the probable

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,479
window

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
and if you look at the worst of those

156
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
three estimates we will cross two

157
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,479
degrees in 18 years in 2040.

158
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,960
now a two degree world is

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
already catastrophic i'm not going to go

160
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
into the details you can read all the

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,680
summaries

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,639
now

163
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
think about the syrian refugee crisis

164
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
that was 6.9 million people leaving

165
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
syria

166
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,199
think about 350 million people in the

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,919
next 18 years becoming international

168
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,280
refugees

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,120
right 50 times that number of people

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
think about what europe think about what

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
fortress europe is going to do in

172
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
response to that we're going to see

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
gunboats in the mediterranean shooting

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
anything that moves automated right who

175
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
know i mean

176
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
the the impact of that on our society if

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
we end up going down that trajectory and

178
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
if we keep thinking about the world from

179
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
a frame of ownership from a frame of

180
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,520
we've got ours

181
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
is not good

182
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
i do not want to live in a world where

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
the eu kills a couple hundred million

184
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
people

185
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
for trying to escape a place where they

186
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
can't live anymore

187
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
so there is some hope

188
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
um

189
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
there's actually a lot of hope because

190
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
it turns out that the technical

191
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
transition is entirely possible none of

192
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,680
this is a technical problem and even the

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
bits that are a technical problem we

194
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,199
still keep finding new and new cool

195
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
things um

196
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,120
last year a saudi team figured out that

197
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
you can extract lithium from seawater so

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
we don't need to mine lithium anymore

199
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
it's actually all of that whole resource

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
crisis specifically about lithium is

201
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
gone and the process is so cheap

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
and it produces

203
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
chlorine and a couple of other things as

204
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
by-products that the lithium itself is

205
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
almost free

206
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
um so yeah grid scale batteries not

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,599
actually going to be a particularly big

208
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,240
deal this is genuinely amazingly good

209
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
news and there's a lot of that stuff out

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
there um we finally had a hybrid lift

211
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
vehicle get its um get commercial

212
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
funding right so you know air travel yes

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
it's the third the speed but you can

214
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,000
carry 20 times as much and uh per

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
passenger mile if you're looking at it

216
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
for for air passengers it's like a tenth

217
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,960
of the carbon right and for shorter

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
trips they can run entirely hybrid

219
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,360
so we probably get to keep air travel

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,039
even right like there's there's

221
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
genuinely a lot of good news in there

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
if we actually act um

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
the

224
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
one of the interesting things

225
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
one of the complexities of this

226
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
is that transition requires

227
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
infrastructure equality right

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,360
we here in this world live in a world

229
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
where everything works for us that is

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
not how most of the world works things

231
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
are going to need to get a lot more

232
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
equal and in most part that means that

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
everybody else needs to get brought up

234
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,759
to speed significantly because that's

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,440
the only way that we can make a green

236
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
transition work right you know yes

237
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
there's some leap frogging you can build

238
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,120
microgrids you can do this you can do

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,840
that

240
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
but the end impact

241
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
is significantly more equality of

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,879
structure

243
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
now

244
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
the problem is

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,520
us basically right the problem that we

246
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
are dealing with the reason why we are

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
putting human civilization into an early

248
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
grave is that we are a bunch of rich

249
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
 who want to own the world

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
and i say we because i mean us

251
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,519
i mean all of us not just here but

252
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
across the first world right

253
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
that you know

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
if we were willing to play ball properly

255
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,279
there's a lot of motivation around the

256
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
places that are gonna die first

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
to like

258
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
fix things

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
and it's not a technical problem we just

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
have to choose to do the work we have to

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
choose that we would rather live than be

262
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
rich

263
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
and specifically the problem is all of

264
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,560
those new billionaires

265
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
i mean it's also us but it's them too

266
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
it's them most specifically because the

267
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
oligarchs are starting to plan for a

268
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,160
tradition a transition they're starting

269
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
to plan for an oligarchy preserving

270
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
transition where they keep their

271
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
position in the power structure and

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
possibly even improve it

273
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
and that means a genocide

274
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
right not not necessarily an

275
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,040
intentionally shooting people genocide

276
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
it's just you know things happen to

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
populations sometimes you know which to

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
be fair humans have been doing for a

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
very long time all of us are the heirs

280
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
of literally dozens of genocides in the

281
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
historical record as my friend quinn

282
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
says it's one of the things that makes

283
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
us uniquely human is that we commit

284
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,839
so many genocides

285
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,920
just like dozens of them in the average

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
century you know and and you know that's

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,680
that's a thing that is unique from the

288
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
animal kingdom lots of other stuff not

289
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
genocides

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
um

291
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,320
but anyway so let's so

292
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
if we're going to make it through this

293
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
transition we need to start thinking

294
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
about our lives a little bit differently

295
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,600
and one of the interesting things that's

296
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
happened which is actually the genesis

297
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,040
of this talk and why i decided that i

298
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
maybe had something to talk about in the

299
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
governance space again

300
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
is some folks have been going back and

301
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
looking at the archaeological record

302
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
again because there's a lot of really

303
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
interesting archaeology

304
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
and research that's been done over the

305
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
past 40 or 50 years

306
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,000
about kind of the shape of the world and

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
how we got here and it turns out that

308
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,200
the ideas that we have about history and

309
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
about

310
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
powers

311
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
and about the um i think it's the pack

312
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
or something

313
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
but

314
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
the the ideas that we have about the

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
history of power and that kind of thing

316
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,959
are uh really kind of wrong and why

317
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
they're wrong is a very interesting

318
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
story um how many people here have read

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
graber and wenger's new book the dawn of

320
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,959
everything

321
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,680
a few okay so chunks of this are lifted

322
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
from that it's a great book the rest of

323
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,440
you should absolutely go and read it

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
also uh james scott's against the grain

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
um come up to me afterwards if you want

326
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,839
the names again so anyway so let's start

327
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,079
talking about freedom right freedom is a

328
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,600
really interesting concept it's one of

329
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
the things that we're very

330
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
bent on preserving in this transition we

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
talk a lot about human rights and all of

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
this stuff um so where did our idea of

333
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
freedom come from

334
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,120
well it turns out that most of the

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
original sources for this came from

336
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
roman authors like those were the

337
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,440
authorities that um enlightenment

338
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
scholars drew from very directly when

339
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,200
they kind of

340
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
coined the set of ideas that became

341
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,880
modern human rights

342
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,519
now every single one of those roman

343
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,079
authors owned slaves

344
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
and to own something meant that you were

345
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
allowed to kill them

346
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
that was the baseline from which they

347
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
constructed their idea of freedom

348
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
freedom is the ability

349
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
to own things absolutely and destroy

350
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,639
them at will

351
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
so yeah we want to own things and that's

352
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
why we're killing the world because

353
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,880
that's our

354
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,360
our idea of freedom is the ability to

355
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
kill things

356
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
so maybe we should look at other ideas

357
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
of freedom because that one seems like

358
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
it's starting to become slightly

359
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
problematic at scale

360
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,480
um

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,839
so yeah human rights showed up in the

362
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
enlightenment became the new way that we

363
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
frame the structure of society um along

364
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,079
with a bunch of other ideas like

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,519
democracy and other things which have

366
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,440
panned out you know better and worse in

367
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
different places um

368
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
but we're kind of at the end of the

369
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
enlightenment so

370
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
about

371
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
12 12 and a half years ago eleven i

372
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
don't remember some time ago at ccc

373
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
quinn and i did a talk called no neutral

374
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
ground in the burning world where we

375
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
talked about the end of the

376
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
enlightenment and that's basically what

377
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
we've been living through right the rise

378
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
of large-scale online disinformation

379
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,040
is kind of the end of that rational

380
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,519
society right we're going back into the

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
age of gods and monsters where you pick

382
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,800
which mythology you believe in and that

383
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,480
process happens largely outside of the

384
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
kind of institutional trust structure

385
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,519
all of the other things that were the

386
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
core of the

387
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
you know the way that society was

388
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
supposed to work

389
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
um so now that it's dead let's look

390
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
about where the enlightenment came from

391
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
and specifically where ideas of the

392
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
world came from there are basically two

393
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
models of um

394
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
two models of how

395
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
like what's the what's the default state

396
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
of human nature right there's hobs human

397
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
nature is you know the the base human

398
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,680
nature is the battle of all against all

399
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
it's red and tooth and claw

400
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
and there's rousseau which said that

401
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,399
human nature is miraculous and blissful

402
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
but as soon as you get organization as

403
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,519
soon as you get any large-scale

404
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
population well then you have to have

405
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
power over then you have to have

406
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
hierarchy it's impossible to have you

407
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,959
know even a village without a village

408
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,920
headman

409
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,279
um

410
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,320
and

411
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
that that paravide and rousseau mostly

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
won right rousseau mostly won that fight

413
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
and uh you know and then hobbs is pulled

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
out when the fascists need to kill some

415
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
people um

416
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
but that was basically the philosophical

417
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
work that was required because this this

418
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
happened in the context where europe was

419
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
leaving the feudal age right and it was

420
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
starting to move towards early market

421
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800
economies and it needed a conceptual

422
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
framework to move from the divine right

423
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,600
of kings to the divine right of money

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
and this provided the conceptual

425
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
framework that all of this hierarchy and

426
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
power over and a strong state with a

427
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
monopoly on violence well these are

428
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
simply inescapable conditions of the

429
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
world there is no alternative and we

430
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
still believe that there is no

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
alternative to capitalism right you have

432
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
to exist in this hierarchical structure

433
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
if you want i don't know sewage removal

434
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
all of the things that we expect in the

435
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
world now right it's a it's a it's a

436
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,040
core of infrastructure

437
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
so

438
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
where did that idea come from

439
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
what was rousseau reading what was he

440
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
responding to

441
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
so it turns out that at the time the

442
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,519
french were uh spreading out across

443
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,560
quebec

444
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
and there were trappers and soldiers and

445
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,040
priests and and you know all sorts of

446
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
folks who were talking to a bunch of the

447
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
natives and they were writing about what

448
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
those folks told them and some of those

449
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
folks even came to france and lectured

450
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
widely you know learned french came to

451
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
france and lectured

452
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,279
and

453
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
there was a very very different model of

454
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
freedom there um and so this is where

455
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,839
this is where the dawn of everything

456
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
like the single set of passages which

457
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,639
kind of justified that book for me

458
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,680
were a bunch of interactions and and you

459
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
know even you know translated texts from

460
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
kadarandak who was a wendat statesman in

461
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,320
the 1680s or so

462
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,759
and this was

463
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,360
someone who

464
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
was you know had had very effective

465
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,560
rhetoric was very clear spoken

466
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
and was clearly very used to arguing his

467
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
case

468
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
talking about a different idea of

469
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,959
freedom

470
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
talking about a completely different

471
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
structure of society

472
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
and so their idea of freedom

473
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,920
was

474
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
started with one principle

475
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
no one should ever have to follow an

476
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,519
order

477
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
there can be no orders in the society

478
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
people are going to agree to do things

479
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,519
together that's totally fine but no top

480
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,360
down orders ever

481
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
now if you take that completely

482
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,079
seriously right if you build your entire

483
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
society on the concept that no one

484
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
should ever be coerced under any

485
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
conditions to do anything well the first

486
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,399
thing you have to get rid of is hunger

487
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
right because a starving man has to

488
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
follow orders right you cannot have

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,279
hunger

490
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
and freedom they are immediately

491
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
incompatible and there's a bunch of

492
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,519
other things you have to have you know

493
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,519
care right you have to you know if you

494
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
if you are hurt you still can't follow

495
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
an order okay

496
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
now that means you know everyone has a

497
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,439
duty to provide certain kinds of care

498
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,760
and labor to make sure that each other

499
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
can remain free

500
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
um and they also had an idea that that

501
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,359
um you should be able to travel and you

502
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
should be able to build your own social

503
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
structures your own kind of um frames of

504
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,720
kind of social combination

505
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
and so the um

506
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
the travel thing ended up being there's

507
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,359
this uh kind of moedy lodge system

508
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
across most of the eastern of eastern

509
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
north america where you'd have the bear

510
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,440
clan and the eagle clan and whatever and

511
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
uh anyone from your clan was had a

512
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
hospital hospitality obligation to you

513
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,240
so you could walk from quebec to you

514
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,160
know like new orleans

515
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
and

516
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
you might not speak the language but

517
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
there would be someone there who had an

518
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,039
obligation to hospitality to you

519
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
and it enabled this kind of freedom of

520
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,320
well

521
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
you know there are too many people here

522
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
who disagree so i'm just going to get up

523
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
and leave i'm just going to walk away

524
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
if you haven't read corey doctor as book

525
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,080
walk away it's also recommended um

526
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
and the the freedom of social

527
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
combinations is another interesting one

528
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,360
because it turns out from the

529
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
archaeological evidence that we have and

530
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,799
this is some of this is guesswork being

531
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,120
pieced together um

532
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
the

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
that

534
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,400
social structure was an intentionally

535
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
created reaction to

536
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
a

537
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,240
somewhere like pre-1000 ce dictatorship

538
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
you know theocratic dictatorship across

539
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
most of

540
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
uh most of kind of eastern north america

541
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
and as that society eventually broke

542
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
down a bunch of people were like okay

543
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,400
that sucked that sucked so much

544
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
that we're never going to let this

545
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
happen again and we're going to

546
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
restructure our entire society

547
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,960
so that it doesn't happen and it's not

548
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
possible and the interesting thing is

549
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
that

550
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
precise thing of saying okay all of the

551
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
base tenants of our society we're going

552
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
to throw them out i'm going to start

553
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,280
over again has happened so many times it

554
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,480
is probably it is one of the fundamental

555
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
things that makes us human is that we

556
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
introspect on our system of governance

557
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,720
and our way of living together and we

558
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,840
change it

559
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
and we do that

560
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
until recently we do that very very

561
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,000
frequently there were in fact a bunch of

562
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,960
um

563
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
indigenous groups in a bunch of

564
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
different parts of the world that

565
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
intentionally often seasonally would

566
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
swap their entire system of governance

567
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
you know often they'd live in a small

568
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
band structure that might be um very

569
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
democratic in the summers and then

570
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
they'd come into a theocratic or

571
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,440
autocratic winter structure

572
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
um but you know the people who were in

573
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
charge in the winters had no power in

574
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
the summertime

575
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,080
and

576
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
this was again

577
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
our best guess if we look at where those

578
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
things came from that was that wasn't oh

579
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,919
this is the primitive state of nature

580
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,280
that was a bunch of people who were like

581
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,919
ah if we build things this way then

582
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,240
those don't get uppity and try

583
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
to stick around

584
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
so we're gonna we're gonna intentionally

585
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
structure our society to avoid the

586
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,039
persistent concentration of power

587
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
um and one of the other things that's

588
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,720
interesting that comes out of looking at

589
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,799
the at the archaeological research

590
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,280
is this idea that um

591
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,320
well you know as soon as you have

592
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,720
complexity you need hierarchy

593
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
so the time from the first

594
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,520
city

595
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
first thing that we would call a city to

596
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
the first city where there's where

597
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
there's archaeological evidence of a

598
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,640
hierarchical government

599
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
is about 2 000 years

600
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
it took a very long time

601
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,280
for us to start having those two forms

602
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,799
go together and even after that point

603
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
many many many civilizations persisted

604
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
non-hierarchically in a bunch of

605
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
different contexts or

606
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
tried a just wild panoply of governance

607
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
styles

608
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
now

609
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
the reason this hasn't been you know the

610
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,039
reason this isn't uh

611
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
more sort of common knowledge is that

612
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
looking at the archaeological record in

613
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
this way requires syncretism across a

614
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
huge number of sites and acquires it

615
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,679
requires kind of reevaluation from first

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,080
principles which is basically not

617
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
publishable in an academic context

618
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,799
because it's too far out of any of

619
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
anyone's lane um the book that graber

620
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,039
and wenger wrote was basically their

621
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,120
hobby project they're well like okay we

622
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
can publish this in the popular press

623
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,159
we're gonna do the work as seriously as

624
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,720
we can but it's academically useless

625
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
because it's it's um it's considered

626
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
unserious right it's too big of a it's

627
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
too big of a picture that we're drawing

628
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,360
um so we've gotten trapped in this

629
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,919
russoian model of

630
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,559
how we interpret archaeological remains

631
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,080
etc

632
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
um

633
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
and

634
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
the interesting thing like if we if we

635
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
look at what um if we look at what

636
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,679
oligarchs do right

637
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,799
and to a certain extent what

638
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,320
institutions do but especially what

639
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
oligarchs do is they're trying to freeze

640
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
structures right they break down the

641
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
institutions that support a pro-social

642
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
world and then they

643
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
use you know market manipulation

644
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,960
monopoly power etc to create these

645
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
frozen structures where

646
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
where political evolution can't happen

647
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
right they do large scale media

648
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
manipulation like there's all of this

649
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,039
this whole set of tools which is

650
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,440
designed to preserve their power over

651
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,760
time

652
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,520
and this is one of the things that we're

653
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,039
now running into

654
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,000
um

655
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
but anyway

656
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
so

657
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,360
the rousseau looked at this challenge of

658
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,919
this oh actually power over

659
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,960
isn't

660
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
necessary

661
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
you know um and one of the interesting

662
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,600
things this enlightenment ideal of

663
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
rational debate

664
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,559
well it turns out when you have a

665
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,400
society that

666
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
where no one can give each other an

667
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,799
order

668
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,400
you end up getting very good at

669
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
convincing people to do things because

670
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
you still need collective action like

671
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
you know there are still crops that need

672
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,559
to be harvested there's still population

673
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,760
movements there's still all of this kind

674
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
of stuff so you have a bunch of people

675
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
who basically spend a big chunk of their

676
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
life in a debate society

677
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
and

678
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
weird right after that contact that's

679
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
contact that started popping up in

680
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,480
european coffee shops and the books that

681
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
uh the books that uh a lot of this

682
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,400
material came in were read by every

683
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
intellectual in europe at the time they

684
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,039
were they were kind of the hot new

685
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
thing the hot new structure

686
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
and what rousseau and others created

687
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,799
with the enlightenment was basically

688
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,279
okay so we have market society and we

689
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,720
have this what feels like a

690
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,039
catastrophically dangerous philosophical

691
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
challenge to

692
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,120
the structure of power to the idea of

693
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
power over

694
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
well we need to come up with

695
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,840
something and what they built was this

696
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,919
enlightenment structure which was

697
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
designed to provide just enough freedom

698
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,679
to sort of contain these ideas that

699
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,520
actually we don't have to be serfs and

700
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,440
we could live in a in a more radically

701
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,120
free way

702
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
while still making room

703
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,320
for

704
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
at the time the kings and the merchants

705
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,799
and the entire structure of power under

706
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,600
that right human rights are sort of a

707
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
trap they're a trap that's designed to

708
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,039
maintain the power structure it's it's

709
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
the right to the bare minimum

710
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,240
not the right to everything

711
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,720
so

712
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
the thing which was really fascinating

713
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
there was this direct experience of

714
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
what is the mental state what is the

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
interiority of someone living in a

716
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,919
non-ownership society right of living in

717
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,720
a world where you own basically nothing

718
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,559
you have you certainly have like the

719
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,400
right to use all of the possessions

720
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
which are close to you um but even there

721
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
there was a whole there's a whole very

722
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
deeply held um

723
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
uh

724
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
belief that well if someone has a dream

725
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
about a thing right if someone has a

726
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
dream about like oh i dreamt of your um

727
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,159
your comb

728
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
well then you have to give it to them

729
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
because you know it's very important

730
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,320
that those kinds of dreams are realized

731
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,159
now now this obviously this could be

732
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
abused but you know this is you know

733
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
this is baked into a very deep social

734
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
contract that no you you you would never

735
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,559
do that falsely right that would be

736
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,039
completely unjustifiable and you know

737
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,440
runs counter to a lot of our ideals

738
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,039
but it means that yes your possessions

739
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
do kind of come and go

740
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,279
but because you are exist in this social

741
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,760
milieu which has an incredibly strong

742
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
contract that says that you will be

743
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,640
taken care of it doesn't matter

744
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
and one of the interesting things as we

745
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,559
look at moving into this time of massive

746
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,440
ecosystemic geopolitical

747
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,840
ecological

748
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,679
disruption is that our stuff isn't going

749
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
to keep us safe

750
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,559
no one in here is going to be safe

751
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
because you own a

752
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
tesla with a bio weapons grade air

753
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
filtering system that's not going to

754
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
 keep you alive and it's not a

755
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,799
question of oh you own an ar-15 guess

756
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,240
what you can still starve

757
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,120
 um you know none of this stuff

758
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,039
is going to keep you alive

759
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,840
what is going to keep you alive is

760
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,039
adaptive work with the people around you

761
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
with the community with the

762
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
infrastructural context that you live in

763
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
and whoever else ends up needing to move

764
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,320
into that because if you try to maintain

765
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,480
that hard border you're back at your

766
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,400
stuff keeping you alive again

767
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
and eventually that's going to fail and

768
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,440
eventually when that border does fail

769
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,039
they're going to be a bit less happy

770
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
about the genocide bit

771
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
so you probably are better off

772
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,360
figuring out how to actually live

773
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,660
together

774
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,240
[Music]

775
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,159
and i think that

776
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,480
you know

777
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,200
knowing that we knowing that it is

778
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,159
possible to do large-scale coordination

779
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
without power over

780
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
knowing that it is possible to live a

781
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,559
life where you have that feeling of of

782
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,880
deep personal safety

783
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
without

784
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
the without the hard governance

785
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,840
structure is incredibly powerful

786
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,399
um

787
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,240
now we are in an era of automation we

788
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,440
are in an era of

789
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,200
permissionification and securification

790
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,399
of all infrastructure right um if you go

791
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,360
to a refugee camp you are required to

792
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,440
use biometrics if you want to eat if

793
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
you're not identifiable you starve right

794
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,240
and it you know and and it's a small

795
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
step

796
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,520
from that to well you know that post you

797
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
made we don't like it so you don't eat

798
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
today and it doesn't take it doesn't

799
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
take eat not eating for very many days

800
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,000
for you to change your you know opinions

801
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
on what you're willing to express

802
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,640
politically

803
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,039
um so if we want to keep freedom we

804
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,440
probably need to start rethinking and

805
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
rebuilding some of these infrastructural

806
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
systems that allow that kind of power

807
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,799
over

808
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,919
um if you look at the history of

809
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,240
european colonialism

810
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
one of the interesting moments was the

811
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,600
introduction of the telegraph because

812
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
the telegraph turned colonies into

813
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
empires because it allowed for the

814
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
centralization of power it allowed for

815
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,240
the centralization of information at a

816
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
speed where governance decisions could

817
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
be made in one place in europe instead

818
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,679
of

819
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,000
you know every every colony every you

820
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
know outpost etc being basically kind of

821
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
on its own you know sure that you'll get

822
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,520
a letter in six months telling you what

823
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,120
you should have done but it's not like

824
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,960
the guy can pro you know can sack you in

825
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
any practical way whereas if you can

826
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
just send a telegram

827
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
to the you know separate uh separately

828
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
commanded security force that he has on

829
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
site it's a very different story in a

830
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
very you know much shorter uh shorter

831
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
enforcement window

832
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,799
so

833
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
the and the other thing is that

834
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,720
reinvention of governance right that

835
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,760
idea of change that idea that we should

836
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
change our social combinations not

837
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,919
because the new one is going to be

838
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
better

839
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
but

840
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,120
because the difference disables that

841
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
accumulative function of power right

842
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,640
changing like you know if we

843
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
let's say every every other generation

844
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,279
we completely change the inheritance

845
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
structure for property you know we all

846
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,120
agreed that like oh you know now it's

847
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,799
collective now it's this now it's that

848
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,559
who knows right and it doesn't matter

849
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
which system we pick but it changes

850
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,039
right

851
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,880
now it's a lottery you inherit somebody

852
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,480
else's property whatever um

853
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,760
you don't get

854
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
dynastic wealth then right you've

855
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,080
immediately eliminated dynastic wealth

856
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,760
but and there were there you know so

857
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,880
many different versions of this where

858
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,559
reinvention

859
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,440
is a critical function and so anything

860
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
that we build that that works against

861
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,799
reinvention is probably going to be used

862
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,600
against us because yeah we are we are a

863
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,840
one percent room here almost certainly

864
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,760
but we're not a tenth of a percent room

865
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
or a hundredth of a percent room or a

866
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
millionth of a percent room

867
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,399
um which means that we're not we're the

868
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,240
people building the tools that are going

869
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
to be used to hurt us we're not the

870
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,039
people who are going to benefit from

871
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,919
those tools you know first first in the

872
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
periphery and then in the core you know

873
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,039
we've watched the us do this with um

874
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,799
you know policing tactics that they

875
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,880
first used in afghanistan and iraq and

876
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
now they use you know now they use them

877
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
at home and now they increasingly are

878
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
using them against you know shock white

879
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,360
people sometimes with money

880
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,799
yeah we shouldn't be shocked about that

881
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,159
because that's what power does that's

882
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,080
how it works so we should maybe think

883
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
about building those tools in the first

884
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
place

885
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,520
um

886
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
so i am an anarchist but

887
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
um and i'm also a communist but

888
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
it turns out that revolutions

889
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,240
are generally bad

890
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,399
they do not work very well

891
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,399
um the historical record for them is

892
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,799
pretty awful and

893
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,159
you know the the

894
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,720
the personally viewed very current

895
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
record for them is also pretty awful on

896
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,679
average um and that's basically because

897
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,840
people still need to eat right

898
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,519
so you have an immediate governance

899
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
problem right the day of the glorious

900
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,120
revolution and then the next day we need

901
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
to move a lot of food around

902
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,159
 how do we do it okay

903
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,559
who knows how this system works this

904
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,120
system is designed infrastructurally

905
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
around an assumption of hierarchy the

906
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,840
railroads need to run the factories need

907
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,519
to run

908
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,720
we're going to put a lot of the same

909
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,399
people in charge because they are the

910
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,840
only ones who claim to know how the job

911
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,159
works etc

912
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,840
and it's very difficult to have a

913
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,640
revolutionary structure that recompita

914
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
that actually changes the form of

915
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
society

916
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,039
without people starving in the meantime

917
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,320
now if you're willing to have people

918
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,720
starve you can actually change the form

919
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,360
of society and we have done this a bunch

920
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,799
because we're good at genocides and we

921
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
like them but maybe that's also not a

922
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,080
great idea a if you don't like genocides

923
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,720
but also if you're trying to manage an

924
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,440
incredibly complex resource transition

925
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,320
where you cannot afford to up

926
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,640
like that right we have

927
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,840
an amazingly narrow window where we get

928
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
to keep globally organized human

929
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
civilization and if we spend it all on

930
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,880
revolutions and wars things are not

931
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,799
looking good

932
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,720
things are not looking good um

933
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,919
so

934
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
and then they then there's so that's the

935
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,159
communist way and the anarchist way is

936
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,919
what we're going to tell people about

937
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,360
the possibility like i'm doing right now

938
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960
we're going to tell people about the

939
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,440
possibility that you could all just live

940
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,240
freely in your own combinations and once

941
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,399
we've told enough people about this then

942
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,679
the day will come where everyone's just

943
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,840
like well yeah let's just go do that

944
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,159
and there's a little step in there you

945
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,200
know we've gotten a lot better at

946
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,279
telling people about things you know um

947
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,799
i am seeing a lot more anarchist

948
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,559
propaganda online these days it's lovely

949
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,320
but also

950
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,919
and then a miracle happens if you

951
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
remember the old new yorker cartoon is

952
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,760
not actually a plan for social

953
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
transition that gets us to carbon zero

954
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
in seven and a half years

955
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
um

956
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
so it's going to be a muddle right we

957
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,880
know it's the best case is this is a

958
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,399
muddle and we get some things massively

959
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,360
wrong because this is a wildly complex

960
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,279
problem right we can't solve it it's not

961
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,600
a problem that has a solution it's a

962
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,679
problem that has an ongoing set of

963
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,720
maintenance

964
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
actions that we will find out if it

965
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,279
worked after the fact and you know who

966
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,519
the knows maybe we get lucky um

967
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
so but we also

968
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
need to do something about the oligarchs

969
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
and we need to do something about hyper

970
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
capitalism that is the beast that

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,559
created this entire thing in the first

972
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,760
place

973
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,200
so

974
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
well what do you do

975
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,080
when you

976
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
need to solve a problem and you don't

977
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,039
know how to solve it

978
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,360
and you're kind of making up as you

979
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,399
go well you generally build a prototype

980
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,079
because prototyping works pretty

981
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,239
effectively now we don't have a ton of

982
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,119
time so probably what you do if you have

983
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,960
a bunch of people and a bunch of

984
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,239
problems is you build a lot of

985
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,639
prototypes all in parallel you know it's

986
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,239
the shotgun method you throw a bunch of

987
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,719
 at the wall and some of it sticks

988
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,159
and then you do that

989
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,760
um

990
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,119
and

991
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,918
so we should perhaps consider

992
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,119
that like

993
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,960
if you are in this room

994
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
you probably have

995
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,839
either financial or lifestyle

996
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,440
flexibility of a certain kind also

997
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,719
because you can come and live in a field

998
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,280
for a week um

999
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
and you're probably interested in sort

1000
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,879
of weird

1001
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
and you have a life um for a short

1002
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,918
period of time before the ecosystem

1003
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,520
breaks down and you probably die

1004
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,280
starving along with everybody else so

1005
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,440
why not spend that life

1006
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,079
 around and finding out

1007
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,880
and you know whatever you've been told

1008
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
about the structure of the world take a

1009
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
look at it and see if that thing that

1010
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,040
you've been told supports the oligarchs

1011
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
continuing to grind us all into dust

1012
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,599
because it probably does because that's

1013
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,160
what we're all told all the time and

1014
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,560
then maybe go try something else i don't

1015
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
know i don't care what you try

1016
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,960
just do something different

1017
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,760
right prototype a new way of interacting

1018
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,359
with power and the structure of the

1019
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,400
world

1020
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,839
and see what comes out of it

1021
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,280
and one of the things that will come out

1022
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,960
of it and this is this is also very

1023
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
relevant for us because this is a room

1024
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,160
full of tool builders right

1025
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,520
and there is such a thing as the

1026
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
revolution of the tool builder because

1027
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,760
tools encode politics they encode ways

1028
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,280
of thinking about the world the

1029
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,800
telegraph encodes empire right um you

1030
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
know one and and we don't necessarily

1031
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
know what those tools mean when we build

1032
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,599
them right it turns out that um al qaeda

1033
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,200
is basically a facebook page with a

1034
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
bunch of ieds

1035
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,960
right it's it's not that much more than

1036
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
a meme

1037
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,560
to the extent that the united states

1038
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
government standard of whether or not

1039
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
you're an al qaeda member is whether or

1040
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
not you say you're an al qaeda member

1041
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
that's it that's literally all you got

1042
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,040
to do it's like anonymous al qaeda is

1043
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
anonymous it's the same thing

1044
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
right

1045
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
so if if i to steal another thing from

1046
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
queen if i if i say that well this is

1047
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,599
the uh this is the the radically queer

1048
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,440
branch of al-qaeda up here all our bombs

1049
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
are glitter bombs i'm now an al-qaeda

1050
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
member because that's how it

1051
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
works

1052
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
right that's literally the way the

1053
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,520
governance structure works um so we

1054
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
don't necessarily know what the tools

1055
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
work bill we build are going to mean um

1056
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,079
and we're gonna have to do some finding

1057
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,320
out but it's very difficult to find out

1058
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
if you also don't have a lived context

1059
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
in which those tools work

1060
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,119
so maybe go make friends with a bunch of

1061
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,720
people who aren't in this room who are

1062
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,119
very different from you and try doing

1063
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,440
weird in your lives together and

1064
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,599
then try figuring out what are the tools

1065
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
that we need that we don't have

1066
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,079
right what are the you know what are the

1067
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,720
capabilities that are missing in our

1068
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
technical ecosystem that happen to be

1069
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,839
within

1070
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,000
your grasp or the grasp of whoever you

1071
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,480
happen to know um

1072
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
and then see where that takes you

1073
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,040
um one of the things so i've i spent a

1074
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
while working on the briar project

1075
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,119
breyer is an asynchronous messaging tool

1076
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,880
that deals with latencies roughly

1077
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,640
between a microsecond and a month

1078
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,200
designed for very hard security contexts

1079
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
and that came out of watching the

1080
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,760
student protests in london so there was

1081
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
a tool called or my involvement in it

1082
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,000
there's a tool called tsuki

1083
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,839
and suki was an anti-heddling tool

1084
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,520
because it turns out that cops are great

1085
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
dealing with one hundred thousand person

1086
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
march because that's kind of the way

1087
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
they think that's an institutional

1088
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,480
hierarchy yes there's a problem we will

1089
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,320
throw bodies at the problem and they're

1090
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,880
really really wildly bad at dealing with

1091
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,560
20 simultaneous 5 000 person marches all

1092
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,160
around a city when it's a bunch of

1093
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,640
college kids who can run at a fair clip

1094
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
and just like as soon as the cops show

1095
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
up they vanish

1096
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,920
um so

1097
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
suki came out of there was a really bad

1098
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
kettle and

1099
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,400
um

1100
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
somebody built the tool

1101
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,839
to basically just let people you know

1102
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,280
phone in reports and watch where the

1103
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,960
kettle happened and then they told

1104
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
people hey there's a kettle forming here

1105
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,800
don't go there and so they didn't and it

1106
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,119
was mayhem in the most glorious way

1107
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,440
possible um

1108
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,960
and i took a look at this this is very

1109
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
interesting but

1110
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,119
this is like a google maps mashup

1111
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,560
they're going to hammer you the

1112
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
next time you do this okay so how do we

1113
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,040
you know what would a tool look like

1114
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,079
that was

1115
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,160
fully decentralized that was actually

1116
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,880
just running on everybody's phone uses

1117
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,280
you know local wi-fi or bluetooth or

1118
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,240
whatever

1119
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
you know gsm uplinks if it's if it's

1120
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,839
there um

1121
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,119
and that makes the source of all this

1122
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,520
data pretty untrackable and then a

1123
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
friend of a friend was already working

1124
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,400
on briar and i was like ah that's an rpc

1125
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,560
layer that's an rpc layer that deals

1126
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,720
with this kind of you know hard systemic

1127
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
problem and the tool has moved very

1128
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
slowly we still don't have that version

1129
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,640
i'm not super involved at this point um

1130
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
but someday i would like to go back

1131
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,480
and take that tool and say okay so what

1132
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
if we had what would it look like to

1133
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,040
take the dod common operating picture

1134
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
which is a battle space sensor fusion

1135
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,960
system that takes um you know

1136
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,480
information off a bunch of different war

1137
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,839
fighters this is their way of talking

1138
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,599
about it um you know literally

1139
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,359
everything from a heart rate monitor to

1140
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,240
a you know a gps location off an

1141
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,839
individual grunt to uh space based radar

1142
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,440
and figures out

1143
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,520
what does this picture build together

1144
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
who needs to know about this get them

1145
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,359
the information in the form that they

1146
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
need to understand it right so what does

1147
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,280
that look like for anarchists

1148
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
i don't know

1149
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,880
what does that tool do in the world no

1150
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
 clue

1151
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
i might build it and around and

1152
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,200
find out

1153
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
um

1154
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,000
so

1155
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,599
that's kind of what i'm suggesting that

1156
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,800
we do

1157
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
is around and find out but the

1158
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,839
problem with around and finding

1159
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,200
out is that the oligarchs are still

1160
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,319
there

1161
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,599
and they're looking at these tools that

1162
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,040
we're building

1163
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
and they're being like well that's an

1164
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
interesting tool i wonder how i can make

1165
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,240
that a tool that helps oligarchs

1166
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,760
has anyone here heard of web3

1167
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,150
 those people entirely

1168
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,319
[Applause]

1169
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,800
we used to have

1170
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,040
15 years ago 10 years ago we used to

1171
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,359
have this really cool burgeoning

1172
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,599
decentralized tech scene that was

1173
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,680
looking at all the cool things that we

1174
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,040
could do if we turned the internet

1175
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,280
inside out again and you know that take

1176
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
advantage of this permissionless

1177
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,319
innovation and break down all these

1178
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,520
silos

1179
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,599
and then the bitcoin moved in

1180
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,440
and now anytime somebody says

1181
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,040
decentralization oh but where's your

1182
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,480
token

1183
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,440
so

1184
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,000
 around and fight out shoot a web 3

1185
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,800
developer today

1186
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,440
build a new system in the world and

1187
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
possibly we might get to keep globally

1188
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,860
organized civilization

1189
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,550
[Applause]

1190
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,199
[Music]

1191
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,319
so i think we have a bit of time for

1192
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,319
questions

1193
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
or comments or wild rants

1194
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,880
please no vegetables

1195
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,520
so we we do have time for questions and

1196
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,359
answers if you have a question or

1197
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,880
comment or

1198
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
whatever please walk up to the

1199
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,200
microphones and

1200
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,880
ask a question

1201
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,839
um i see from we don't have a question

1202
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,079
from the internet yet unfortunately yes

1203
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,160
please come up to the microphone walk

1204
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,240
closely to the microphone and speak into

1205
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,720
it thank you

1206
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
um

1207
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,200
you

1208
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
said that

1209
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
revolutions are kind of a bad idea

1210
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,359
because it doesn't work

1211
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,240
but you also said that

1212
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,280
societies in the past used to change

1213
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
every time and we would try many

1214
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,960
different things

1215
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,800
do you not think that revolution is the

1216
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,440
way to do that like if something breaks

1217
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,119
down bends down

1218
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,800
then there is space to create something

1219
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
new if there isn't how can something new

1220
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
come up

1221
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,520
so

1222
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
partially what i'm proposing is that we

1223
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,079
build parallel things next to it because

1224
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,160
part of the problem with revolutions and

1225
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,079
like hey revolutions do work if you're

1226
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,599
willing to accept a genocide as the cost

1227
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,520
of the revolution i am generally

1228
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,000
anti-genocide um i feel fairly

1229
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
comfortable in that position but also

1230
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,319
the problem is that revolutions

1231
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,560
successful revolutions with genocides

1232
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,079
are incredibly infrastructurally

1233
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,960
disrupting and while we might have one

1234
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
right now it makes it very unlikely that

1235
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,400
we're gonna hit carbon zero in seven and

1236
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
a half years

1237
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,720
so it's probably a bad idea right now

1238
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,760
but

1239
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
in parallel like where's the space like

1240
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,560
we

1241
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,720
everything is built like there's no land

1242
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,000
uh

1243
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,560
where where would that in parallel be

1244
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,680
i don't know

1245
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,480
but like like i said i do not have

1246
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,560
answers for you today maybe i have

1247
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,160
interesting questions although one of

1248
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
the things is as large scale societal

1249
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
structures start breaking down you get

1250
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,880
cracks you get places where you can do

1251
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,359
things for a little while is it enough i

1252
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,680
don't know let's find out

1253
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,000
thank you

1254
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,920
uh hi so my question is the following

1255
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,599
statement uh

1256
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
breyer has been used on protests in

1257
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,200
poland already successfully as a uh as a

1258
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,760
backup for regular cellular

1259
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,800
communication any other i am uh just

1260
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
just in case the cell towers were shut

1261
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
down or anything like that right so this

1262
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,160
thing is already happening the the

1263
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,319
player is already being used as as this

1264
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,480
tool yeah no it is like things are

1265
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,240
moving it's just you know yeah

1266
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,680
have you seen how the uh ukrainians

1267
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,119
manage their crowdsourced resources

1268
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,359
no i haven't um

1269
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,560
but i i i have some guesses

1270
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,280
and like i've seen what uh occupy sandy

1271
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,440
did for instance which is another

1272
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
fascinating case of a horizontal

1273
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,800
resource distribution network

1274
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,119
so what happens is that

1275
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,599
you have organizations that collect

1276
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,920
resources from

1277
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,760
all over the world

1278
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
and the way they distribute those to

1279
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,839
groups is

1280
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,680
they look at your reputation on social

1281
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,760
media

1282
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,880
you're a group you post some videos of

1283
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,200
you bombing fascists

1284
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,480
and that makes you a credible group to

1285
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,400
send resources to

1286
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,920
so what i'm hearing is the russians are

1287
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,540
going to start gaming youtube a lot more

1288
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,280
[Laughter]

1289
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,119
just dmca take down all the bombing

1290
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,760
videos anyway but yeah no i mean that

1291
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,359
makes a lot of sense i mean reputation

1292
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,920
systems are complicated

1293
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
they're fine as long as you don't try to

1294
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
formalize them because the first rule of

1295
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
building a reputation system is that no

1296
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,960
one who has a reputation has time to

1297
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,480
interact with a reputation management

1298
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,640
system so they kind of don't work when

1299
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,520
you formalize them but informal ones we

1300
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,839
use all the

1301
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,280
time and thank you for a thought

1302
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,640
provoking thought uh talk i should say

1303
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,800
so i was wondering if you um

1304
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,720
are aware of the work of philip bethet

1305
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,319
who has a particular conception of

1306
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,280
freedom

1307
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,480
so it's a

1308
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,160
we of course knows the two conceptions

1309
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,920
of freedom that berlin always talks

1310
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
about sort of liberal

1311
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
ideas so the liberal idea of freedom is

1312
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,960
that you are only free if you are free

1313
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,480
of people

1314
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,880
interfering with what you want to do

1315
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,839
very liberal idea and his idea that is a

1316
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,560
very old idea as well is that you're

1317
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,119
only free if you're free from domination

1318
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,119
so that's very similar to what you said

1319
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,280
i think slightly different because i

1320
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,480
think he believes that um that that is

1321
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,400
possible

1322
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,200
um in a democracy so there can still be

1323
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,440
orders probably but the but the orders

1324
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,480
can never be arbitrary they should be

1325
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,720
organized in a way that is non-arbitrary

1326
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,400
so that you can count or not so i don't

1327
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,640
know in a state with a rule of law all

1328
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,440
these things that i guess is a slightly

1329
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,200
different from your anarchist point of

1330
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,960
view so i'm very curious to hear your

1331
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,119
thoughts about is this

1332
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,920
non-ownership society possible maybe in

1333
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,280
a democratic state or what are your

1334
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,760
thoughts about the democracy in general

1335
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,680
i mean i think

1336
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,200
i believe in the idea of obligate

1337
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,520
geographic infrastructural collectives

1338
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,599
right so if you were trying to manage

1339
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,040
water you have a problem which is at the

1340
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,480
scale of a watershed

1341
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
you cannot manage that via a group that

1342
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,160
is smaller than everyone who lives in

1343
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
the watershed right because that is the

1344
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,240
shape of the program similarly we have a

1345
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,800
we have an atmosphere shed right so we

1346
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,440
have a you know we we will

1347
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,599
you know we have a global obligate

1348
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,440
resource management problem that

1349
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,920
requires cooperation from everyone

1350
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,839
however that doesn't mean that we need a

1351
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,200
global government that manages

1352
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,880
everything in our lives it means that we

1353
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,319
meant we need a global government that

1354
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,880
manages everything that we put into that

1355
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,400
global commons

1356
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
so i think the

1357
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,000
one of the biggest problems with the

1358
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,440
state is that we each only live in one

1359
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
of them

1360
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,319
we should live in hundreds of different

1361
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,400
states that are structured around

1362
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,880
hundreds of different problems

1363
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
that are actually independent of each

1364
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,359
other right yes it means wildly more

1365
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,079
overhead however if we stop spending all

1366
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,760
of our time making marketing videos and

1367
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,000
doing whatever the other stuff we

1368
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,640
do you're gonna spend a lot more time in

1369
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,839
well you're not going to spend more time

1370
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,520
in meetings you're just going to spend

1371
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,440
the same time in very different kinds of

1372
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,400
meetings

1373
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,240
right it's not like we don't have the

1374
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,160
social capacity you know the the joke

1375
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,599
about the problem with socialism is it

1376
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,359
takes too many evenings that's fine do

1377
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,079
it during the day instead

1378
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,280
so yes we we probably do need

1379
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,680
structures that for instance yes the the

1380
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,000
global atmospheric collective probably

1381
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,200
needs to

1382
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,599
have recourse to coercive violence

1383
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,440
around things that people put into the

1384
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,760
air be great if they didn't need to but

1385
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,280
they're probably going to need that

1386
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,880
however they shouldn't have it anywhere

1387
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,920
else

1388
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,200
how we achieve that fracturing is left

1389
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,119
as an exercise to the reader

1390
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,520
last question please unfortunately we

1391
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
run enough time okay

1392
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,960
so yeah so my question is kind of

1393
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
related to the first question uh

1394
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,480
and it's

1395
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,440
sure

1396
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
so my question is kind of related to the

1397
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
first question and it basically boils

1398
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,079
down to the idea is is it possible to do

1399
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:38,960
um

1400
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,040
an anarchist revolution right

1401
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,920
so when i when i look what happened

1402
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,720
to

1403
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,880
in arab spring for example all the

1404
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,760
revolutions fell basically but what came

1405
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,440
out of it was basically what you were

1406
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,599
describing like anarchy people learned

1407
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,880
about a different way and

1408
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,359
i think and a lot of people think it

1409
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,000
will you know pay off in like 30 40

1410
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,040
years or something so maybe i like i'm

1411
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,920
i'm

1412
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,720
i'm definitely not against the idea

1413
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
but we have a very short-term problem

1414
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,200
right now um i don't know the i don't

1415
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,720
know the answer to the larger question i

1416
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,839
have no idea um i think that

1417
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,460
if you

1418
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,640
[Music]

1419
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,440
it feels very likely to be messy unless

1420
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,040
you've done some of the prep work in

1421
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,240
parallel

1422
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,280
right

1423
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,960
if you have

1424
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,079
a set of social structures that

1425
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,800
could provide an alternate organizing

1426
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,240
mechanism for whatever set of

1427
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,480
infrastructure you need to run

1428
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
that you can

1429
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
swap in relatively quickly right

1430
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,599
you know your first hundred day plan for

1431
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,640
after the revolution right is well okay

1432
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,640
we allow certain forms of hierarchical

1433
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,400
organization for critical infrastructure

1434
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,720
to continue and then we transition them

1435
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,200
through into you know whatever right

1436
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,319
but

1437
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,160
and and this is the this is partially

1438
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,240
the exigent nature of revolutions right

1439
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,359
you spend

1440
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,040
all of your capacity

1441
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,400
planning for how do you get to the

1442
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,920
revolution

1443
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,480
and it's very difficult to have the

1444
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,160
practical 100-day plan and the

1445
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
transition team ready when you haven't

1446
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,760
started doing the shooting yet but

1447
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,559
that's kind of when you need to do it

1448
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,240
and so

1449
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,760
i think what i would want to see from an

1450
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,440
anarchist revolution is a lot more

1451
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,839
organization

1452
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,200
because that's what makes it actually

1453
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,839
 work

1454
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,880
thank you all

1455
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,200
you
